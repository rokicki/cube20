The two pages linked below gives the results of optimally solving
all symmetric positions of the cube, first in the half-turn metric
and then in the quarter-turn metric.  The half-turn metric results
confirm Radu and Kociemba's results; the quarter-turn metric results
are new.
<p>
For insight into symmetry as it applies to the cube, I can't write
anything better than <a href="http://kociemba.org/symmetric2.htm">Herbert
Kociemba's page</a> on symmetry and the cube.
