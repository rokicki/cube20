Superflip composed with fourspot, the first position proven to require 26 moves.
</div>

Every position of Rubik's Cube&trade; can be solved in 26 quarter
moves or less.
<p>
With about 29 CPU-years of idle computer time at the Ohio Supercomputing
Center, two researchers have essentially solved every position of the
Rubik's Cube&trade; in the quarter-turn metric,
and shown that no position requires more than 26
moves.

<h2>What is the Quarter-Turn Metric?</h2>

In the early days of cube mathematics, two camps emerged on how
to measure the difficulty of a position.  West coast and Stanford
mathematicians, free thinkers all, tended to prefer the half-turn metric,
where any twist of any face, whether 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees
counted as a single move.  The east coast crowd, including MIT, tended
to prefer the rigor of the quarter-turn metric, where a half-turn
counted as two moves, since of course it could be accomplished by
two consecutive quarter turns.
<p>
Indeed, the mathematics of the quarter-turn metric are very
interesting.  The positions of the cube can be separated by a
concept called permutation parity into even and odd positions.  Every
quarter turn from an odd position yields and even position, and
vice versa, so any move sequence in the quarter-turn metric
ping-pongs between even and odd
positions.  This is not true of the half-turn metric.
Simply by examining a position, without any search, one
can determine whether the optimal sequence length of any position
is even or odd.
<p>
Further interest comes from the nature of the antipodes in the two
metrics.  An antipode is a distance that is maximally far from
solved, one that requires the maximum number of moves to solve.
In the half-turn metric, with a God's Number of 20, we know there
are hundreds of millions of such positions.  Surprisingly, in the
quarter-turn metric, only a single position (and its two rotations)
is known that requires the maximum of 26 moves.  Despite significant
effort, no additional distance-26 positions have been found.
<p>
Even at distance 25, only two positions (and their rotations) are
known to exist.  At distance 24, perhaps 150,000 positions exist.

<h2>A History of God's Number in the Quarter-Turn Metric</h2>

By 1980, a lower bound of 19 had been established for God's Number by
analyzing the number of effectively distinct move sequences of 17 or
fewer moves, and finding that there were fewer such sequences than
Cube positions of odd parity.  The first
upper bound was probably around 140 or so, by analyzing the
worst-case move count of the early solution booklets.
This table summarizes the
subsequent results.

<h2>How We Did It</h2>
How did we solve all 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 positions of the Cube?
<ul>
<li>We partitioned the positions into 2,217,093,120 sets
of 19,508,428,800 positions each.</li>
<li>We reduced the count of sets we needed to solve to 55,882,296
using symmetry and set covering.</li>
<li>We did not find optimal solutions to each position, but instead
only solutions of length 26 or less.</li>
<li>We wrote a program that solved a single set in about 17 seconds.</li>
<li>We used about 29 CPU years to find solutions to all of the
positions in each of the 55,882,296 sets.</li>
</ul>
