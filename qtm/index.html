        Superflip composed with fourspot, the first position proven to require
        26 moves.
      </div>
    </div>
    Every position of Rubik's Cube&trade; can be solved in 26 quarter moves or
    less.
    <p>
      With about 29 CPU-years of idle computer time at the Ohio Supercomputing
      Center, two researchers have essentially solved every position of the
      Rubik's Cube&trade; in the quarter-turn metric, and shown that no position
      requires more than 26 moves.
    </p>

    <h2>What is the Quarter-Turn Metric?</h2>

    In the early days of cube mathematics, two camps emerged on how to measure
    the difficulty of a position. West coast and Stanford mathematicians, free
    thinkers all, tended to prefer the half-turn metric, where any twist of any
    face, whether 90 degrees, 180 degrees, or 270 degrees counted as a single
    move. The east coast crowd, including MIT, tended to prefer the rigor of the
    quarter-turn metric, where a half-turn counted as two moves, since of course
    it could be accomplished by two consecutive quarter turns.
    <p>
      Indeed, the mathematics of the quarter-turn metric are very interesting.
      The positions of the cube can be separated by a concept called permutation
      parity into even and odd positions. Every quarter turn from an odd
      position yields and even position, and vice versa, so any move sequence in
      the quarter-turn metric ping-pongs between even and odd positions. This is
      not true of the half-turn metric. Simply by examining a position, without
      any search, one can determine whether the optimal sequence length of any
      position is even or odd.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further interest comes from the nature of the antipodes in the two
      metrics. An antipode is a distance that is maximally far from solved, one
      that requires the maximum number of moves to solve. In the half-turn
      metric, with a God's Number of 20, we know there are hundreds of millions
      of such positions. Surprisingly, in the quarter-turn metric, only a single
      position (and its two rotations) is known that requires the maximum of 26
      moves. Despite significant effort, no additional distance-26 positions
      have been found.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even at distance 25, only two positions (and their rotations) are known to
      exist. At distance 24, perhaps 150,000 positions exist.
    </p>

    <h2>A History of God's Number in the Quarter-Turn Metric</h2>

    By 1980, a lower bound of 19 had been established for God's Number by
    analyzing the number of effectively distinct move sequences of 17 or fewer
    moves, and finding that there were fewer such sequences than Cube positions
    of odd parity. The first upper bound was probably around 140 or so, by
    analyzing the worst-case move count of the early solution booklets. This
    table summarizes the subsequent results.

    <h2>How We Did It</h2>
    How did we solve all 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 positions of the Cube?
    <ul>
      <li>
        We partitioned the positions into 2,217,093,120 sets of 19,508,428,800
        positions each.
      </li>
      <li>
        We reduced the count of sets we needed to solve to 55,882,296 using
        symmetry and set covering.
      </li>
      <li>
        We did not find optimal solutions to each position, but instead only
        solutions of length 26 or less.
      </li>
      <li>We wrote a program that solved a single set in about 17 seconds.</li>
      <li>
        We used about 29 CPU years to find solutions to all of the positions in
        each of the 55,882,296 sets.
