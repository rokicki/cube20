Superflip, the first position proven to require 20 moves.
</div>
</div>
Every position of Rubik's Cube&trade; can be solved in twenty moves or less.
<p>
With about 35 CPU-years of idle computer time donated by Google,
a team of researchers has essentially solved every position of the
Rubik's Cube&trade;, and shown that no position requires more than twenty
moves.
<p>
Every solver of the Cube uses an algorithm, which is a sequence of
steps for solving the Cube.  One algorithm might
use a sequence of moves to solve the top face, then another
sequence of moves to position the middle edges, and so on.
There are many different algorithms, varying in complexity and number
of moves required, but those that can be memorized by a mortal
typically require more than forty moves.
<p>
One may suppose God would use a much more efficient algorithm, one
that always uses the shortest sequence of moves; this is known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_algorithm"
>God's Algorithm</a>.  The number of moves this algorithm would take
in the worst case is called God's Number.  At long last,
God's Number has been shown to be 20.
<p>
It took fifteen years after the introduction of the Cube to find the
first position that provably requires twenty moves to solve; it is
appropriate that fifteen years after that, we prove that twenty moves
suffice for all positions.
<h2>A History of God's Number</h2>
<p>
By 1980, a lower bound of 18 had been established for God's Number by
analyzing the number of effectively distinct move sequences of 17 or
fewer moves, and finding that there were fewer such sequences than
Cube positions.  The first
upper bound was probably around 80 or so from the algorithm in one
of the early solution booklets.  This table summarizes the
subsequent results.

<h2>How We Did It</h2>
How did we solve all 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 positions of the Cube?
<ul>
<li>We partitioned the positions into 2,217,093,120 sets
of 19,508,428,800 positions each.</li>
<li>We reduced the count of sets we needed to solve to 55,882,296
using symmetry and set covering.</li>
<li>We did not find optimal solutions to each position, but instead
only solutions of length 20 or less.</li>
<li>We wrote a program that solved a single set in about 20 seconds.</li>
<li>We used about 35 CPU years to find solutions to all of the
positions in each of the 55,882,296 sets.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Partitioning</h4>

We broke the problem down into 2,217,093,120 smaller problems, each
comprising 19,508,428,800 different positions.  Each of these subproblems
was small enough to fit in the memory of a modern PC, and the way
we broke it down (mathematically, using cosets of the group generated
by {U,F2,R2,D,B2,L2}, or more concisely, cosets of H) allowed us to
solve each set rapidly.

<h4>Symmetry</h4>

If you take a scrambled Cube and turn it upside down, you have not
made it any more difficult; it will still take the same number
of moves to solve.  Instead of solving both of these positions,
you can simply solve one, and then turn the solution upside down
for the other.  There are 24 different ways you can orient the
Cube in space, and another factor of two using a mirror, for a total
reduction of a factor of <a
href="http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Martin.Schoenert/Cube-Lovers/Dan_Hoey__The_real_size_of_cube_space.html"
>about 48</a> in the number of positions that need solving.  Using
similar symmetry arguments and by finding a solution to a large
"set cover" problem, we were able to reduce the number of sets
that needed solving from 2,217,093,120 down to 55,882,296.
<h4>Good vs. Optimal Solutions</h4>
<div>
<div class="leftfloat">
<table>
<tr><td></td><td>Random positions</td><td>Cosets of H</td></tr>
<tr><td>Optimally</td><td>0.36</td>
<td>2,000,000</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>20 moves or less</td><td>3,900</td>
<td>1,000,000,000</td>
</tr>
</table>
<div>Solution rate, in positions/second</div></div>
An optimal solution to a position is one that requires no more
moves than is required.  Since a position that required 20 moves
was already known, we did not need to optimally solve every position;
we just needed to find a solution of 20 moves or less for each
sequence.  This is substantially easier; the table at left show the
rate a good desktop PC has when solving random positions.
<h4>Fast Coset Solving Program</h4>
Using a combination of mathematical tricks and careful programming,
we were able to solve a complete coset of H, either optimally, or with
sequences of twenty moves or less, on a single desktop PC, at the
rates shown in the table at left.
</div>
<h4>Lots of Computers</h4>

Finally, we were able to distribute the 55,882,296 cosets of H among
a large number of computers at Google and complete the computation
in just a few weeks.  Google does not release information on their
computer systems, but it would take a good desktop PC (Intel Nehalem,
four-core, 2.8GHz) 1.1 billion seconds, or about 35 CPU years,
to perform this calculation.

We have known for fifteen years that there are positions that require
20 moves; we have just proved that there are none that require more.
<p>
Distance-20 positions are both rare and plentiful; they are rarer
than one in a billion positions, yet there are probably more than
one hundred million such positions.  We do not yet know exactly
how many there are.  The table on the right gives the count of positions
at each distance; for distances 16 and greater, the number given
is just an estimate.  Our research has confirmed the prior results
for entries 0 through 14 below, and the entry for 15 is a new result.
We hope to have that independently confirmed by another researcher
within the month.
<p>
To date we have found about twelve million distance-20 positions.
The following position was the hardest for our programs to solve:
