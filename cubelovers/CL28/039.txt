Subject: Rubik's cube?
Date: Sun, 31 Oct 1999 12:58:08 +0100

Last week I found a puzzle that looks like something between my old
Rubik's cube and my pyracube.

It has 14 faces: 6 are squares and 8 triangles.

Imagine one side of the pyracube: a square in the middle, and four
little triangles in the corners.

Now when you look at the whole pyracube, the little triangles form 8
pyramids. Then virtually remove these pyramids and you have the shape
of my new puzzle.

In addition it is cut (?) like a Rubik's cube, and consequently has
the same solution.

Have you ever seen this puzzle? was it made by rubik? How is it
called?  Well, I want ot know everything about it since I've been
collecting all rubiks cube-like puzzles for a few years.

Thanks in advance,
Paul
