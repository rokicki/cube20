I snipped off the same corner of every sticker on each face so that all of the face
cubies have to be positioned correctly for a 'complete' solution.  If you have good
eyes (I recently had cataract surgery) you will not need to snip off enough to make
it obtrusive.  My second 5x5x5 just arrived in today's mail and it almost seems like
cheating to solve it in the 'normal' manner after solving for 'completeness.'
