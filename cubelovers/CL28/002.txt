Subject: Square One Parity fix

I have just finished modelling the Square One puzzle in Puzzler and in
testing found a flaw in my solution.  In order to correct a parity problem
(where you have to swap only 2 pieces rather than 4) I do the following
move:

(in Arensburger notation:)

R,t3,b3,R,t1,b2,R,t2,b2,R,t6,R,b-2,t-2,R,b-2,t-1,R,b-3,t-3,R

This scrambles the cube up a bit but makes it solvable using standard moves.

There must be a better move than this!  If anyone knows a better way to swap
two pieces, let me know.
