Hello,

I found your email, address on the internet. I work on the Big Breakfast
Channel 4's daily entertainment show. We are inviting Erno Rubik on the show
next week and we would like to find fans of the Rubik's cube. I wonder if
you could email me the contact numbers of your members, with a view to
inviting them on the show.

My email address is: elsas@planet24.co.uk

Many thanks,
Elsa Sharp 

[Moderator's note: Interested cube lovers should contact Ms Sharp as above; I'm
 not going to release the subscription list.  And as far as e-mail addresses of
 other people you know, I suggest you pass this message to them rather than
 sending their address to some third party without their explicit consent. --Dan ]
