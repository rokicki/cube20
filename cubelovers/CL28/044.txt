Hello Puzzle-Fans,

  I am wondering if anyone could comment on the use of twisty puzzles
(like rubik cube, etc) for those people who suffered a stroke and are
paralyzed slightly on one side and need to exercise their hands.
(The reason I'm asking is because my brother-in-law suffered a stroke
and he needs to exercise his left hand.)   I am wondering if these
types of puzzles are good therapy or a bad idea.  One exercise he does
with his wife is to close his eyes and hold an object in his left hand
and try to figure out its shape (cube, sphere, tetrahedral, etc...)
Any comments, suggestions, references?

Thanks you.
