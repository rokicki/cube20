Since we are sharing stories, I just thought I'd mention how I found a
scrambled cube at the local Salvation Army Thrift Store.  It cost me 18
cents (0.18 USD).  I tried to solve it but I found out the plastic stickers
were removed and rearranged into an impossible position.  The neat thing
is that I believe it is an original Ideal; but I am not sure.  It really
turns smoothly and lines up easily; it is a fantastic cube for speed solving.
Is there a way I can find out what brand it is?  It doesn't say on the white
sticker, I think it wore off.  (this is a 3by cube)
