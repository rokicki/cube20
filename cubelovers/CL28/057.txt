Subject: rubiks hat or rabbit
Date: Sun, 19 Dec 1999 15:49:09 +0100

Hello,

Two days ago I bought a rubiks rabbit.  It is really amazing, and is
more complicated than it looks. Here is the description found in the
archives:

"Rubik's Hat is in the form of a hat with six rings on it. You can
look through it (and through the rings by implication). By turning
rings you see more or less rabbits. The purpose is to see a rabbit in
every position.

I think the puzzle is based on light polarization, with different
polarizations coming through the segments of the rings."

I'm not entirely satisfied with the explanation. Light polarisation
doesn't have this effect on colours, and polarisation lens are too
much expensive to be used. I think this effect is due to simple light
filters (green, red, yellow or a mix of two of these colours). If the
filter is red (=retain all other wave lenghths), then you will only
see red rabbits.

But there is something I can't explain: in one segment I saw a green
rabbit. then I turn a ring and this rabbit disappears. I concluded
that the segment of the ring retains green light. Then I tried all
other colours to see what light could pass through. When i turn this
same ring on another green segment, then I was able to see the rabbit
through it! This was of course not the same rabbit, and in one case
the green rabbit was there and in the other, not, all that with the
same filter!

Could somebody explain that? Do you have any other explanation of this
puzzle?

I've tried my best to explain that in english, but feel free to ask me
for more details,

Bye,
Paul
