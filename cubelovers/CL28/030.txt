If anyone has ever been interested in learning how to work with plastics to
make your own puzzle designs/prototypes, make interesting modifications to
your cubes, or you want to be able to learn how to repair your puzzles; I
have just completed the Twisty megasite.

This is located at:
http://www.zeta.org.au/~sausage/twistymegasite/

I have quite a lot of new and original resource material here, so it might
be well worth keeping an eye on it.

Thanks,
Sausage
