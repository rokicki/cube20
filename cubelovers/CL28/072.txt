I'll add my two cents to this discussion, since I recently acquired some of
the new 4x4x4 units as well.  In short, both the Meffert and Oddzon reissues
are excellent.  The Oddzon initially turned the smoothest, but now my
Meffert's version is broken in and turns equally well.  Both cubes offer a
little give when the faces are not perfectly aligned.  They seem very
forgiving and you don't get the sense that you're going to break something
by playing with them.  In contrast to the old 1982 models (I have 3 or 4 of
the squeaky variety that broke easily), I'd say they're both great
improvements.

Regarding the stickers used, the Oddzon uses the blue opposite green color
scheme (yellow opposite white, orange opposite red).  The stickers on the
unit I received have not worn off like the Oddzon 3x3x3 stickers.  This
could be due to the fact that they are smaller, and less likely to be
scraped by a fingernail?  At any rate, the Meffert's 4x4x4 is clearly
superior since it uses the same six colors, but with the non-slip grooved
tiles.  His color combination places red opposite white and yellow opposite
orange, which works well.

I also got the other new Meffert cubes that feature the non-slip tiles,
including a Megaminx that has 12 unique colors (even the original had two
yellow faces on the top and bottom).  This is the best Megaminx ever!  It's
also nice having the Pyraminx, Skewb, and 5x5x5 in deluxe tile versions.
The cubic puzzles feature the same colors as his new 4x4x4 and the Pyraminx
receives red, blue, yellow, and green.

Finally, I'll mention a new puzzle called QUBLE by Geospace.  This is really
just a 3x3x3 with letters printed on the stickers.  Scrambling the letters
allows word games to be played with the cube, and there are six colors so
you can also solve it the traditional way.  Here is the URL:
