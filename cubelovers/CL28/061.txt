Would please comment on http://www.iteration-gmbh.de/Erubik.html
[ or on the German version http://www.iteration-gmbh.de/Rubik.htm ].
They have an animation which appears to be solving a 6x6x6 cube.

This is possibly related to the English page at
http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~jacob/Evolvica/ES-GA/
ga_magic_problem.html

which shows screen shots of a solver program. I looked at ftp
site and the program doesn't appear to be available, although the
magic square program and a few others are in
ftp://ftp-bionik.fb10.tu-berlin.de/pub/ESdemo/

What then are the prospects of using these methods for cube solving?
While it may be a bit much for them to produce optimal solutions
(or maybe not!), for 4x4x4 and larger the suboptimal solutions may
still be very useful.
