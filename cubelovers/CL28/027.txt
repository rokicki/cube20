Subject: fad of the century

Hello, cube-lovers,
it is my pleasure to infoem you that a poll conducted by aol.com voted
the Rubik's cube as fad of the century. 10 fads were listed and our
little obsession (at least for some of us) was on the very top of the
list.

Congratulations, Rubik's cube!

Hana Bizek

PS IMHO, the cube is more than a fad!
