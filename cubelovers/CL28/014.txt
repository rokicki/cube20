Hello,

	In case anyone is interested, Uwe Meffert is now selling the
Square 1.  I've been looking to buy one for a while, and this is the
perfect opportunity (www.mefferts-puzzles.com/mefferts-puzzles/index.html).  
In relation to the Square 1, I once came across a program that claimed to
help one solve the puzzle.  I could have sworn I saved it to my hard
drive, but now, when I look for it, I can't find it.  I thought it was
called Square1.Exe or Square1.Bas Does anybody know anything about this
program or have a copy lying around?

		Thanks,
		 Matt
