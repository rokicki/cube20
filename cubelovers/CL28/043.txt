My latest addiction has been sliding puzzles, sequential movement puzzles
that are very Rubik-like in nature...I have found a couple of places online
that have are particularly interesting (see below).  I have solved (with the
aid of a program) 44 of the 49 puzzles, and 4 more are just a matter of time
(the states are large but not too large).

However one puzzle, the "Climb Pro 24", by Minoru Abe (link below) is beyond
my program's reach.  It has far too many combinations for my state program
to solve it.

This is where the cube lovers come in.  How do I design a program to solve
this puzzle?  Any ideas or algorithms would be appreciated, especially on
how to reduce the decision tree and know when you've repeated a state
without keeping all of the states in memory.

Regardless if I ever figure out a solution, I know lots of you will enjoy
the following,
