I purchase the Oddzon Revenge during it's first initial run.  I have played
with it alot, and it's mechanism is quite nice.  It is as good as my
original Revenge.  So, I can support Jin's claim.

As far as the stickers go, we all know that the plastic laminated stickers
that Oddzon uses do not last if you plan on playing with the puzzle.  This
is still true with the "new" Revenges.  Even if you do not plan on speed
cubing with it, the oils in ones hands gets under the lamination and it ends
up folding up, making it annoying to play with.

I have found a temporary fix for this.  I found at the hardware store
(almost any commercial hardware store should do) that they sell electrical
tape in several colors.  Since electrical tape is vinyl, it will stand up to
abuse.  I bought all six (identically the same as the original) colors in
1/4 inch width size.  This is definatly a good fix, since you don't have to
"ruin" the cube (i.e. painting) the plastic cubies.

I say that this is a temporary fix, because from what I understand, starting
in Febuary, Uwe Meffert is going to offer plastic tiles for sale, so cubist
can fix up are old worn out stickers on their puzzles.  He already offers
plastic tiles for 3X3X3 cubes for one dollar per color (each color includes
9 tiles for all cubies on one side).  This is an incredible option, because
not only will we be able to restore our puzzles back to excelent condition,
we will be able to create more custom color arrangements.
