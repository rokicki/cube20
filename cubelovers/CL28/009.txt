For starters, you'd be amazed what a B6 added to the beginning or end of
this pattern will do. :-) Alternatively, you could skip over that and
simply add two dual edge swaps by appending something like
t1,R,t-1,b-1,R,t6,R,t1,b1,R,t3,b3,R,t-1,b-1,R,t6,R,t1,b1,R,t-4,b-3
to the beginning or end of your pattern. L8r.
