Uwe Meffert was too humble to post the following facts to the list.  However,
true cube lovers know that facts are too important.  Just as we needed to be
informed that recent remakes of old standards by Odds-On don't survive very
long in actual use, we need to know of superb manufactures such as the ones
in this thread.  Therefore I post them.

Recently my wife and I visited Mr. Meffert in Hong Kong and played with some
of his products and prototypes.  Prototypes of the assembly cubes were the
smoothest turning cubes that we have ever got our hands on.  In addition the
assembly cubes had colored tiles which look like they will not wear out during
an owner's lifetime.

Mr. Meffert added in private e-mail, with permission to repost:  the cube has a
unique patented mechanism which allows assembly disassembly of the cube
without screws or tools, which in itself is quite a challenge.
