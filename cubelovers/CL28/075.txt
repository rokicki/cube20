That would be quite a challenge to create. Truth be told, I'm not even
sure if such a creation would be possible. However it is possible to make
a Skewb with 8 trianges on a side, and has already been done. It's called
a Star Skewb, and is made by switching the centres of a standard Skewb
with those of a Diamond Skewb, which Meffert is currently selling.

This has also already been done. Hendrik Haak (www.puzzle-shop.de) is
currently selling the Dogic 2. If have yet to buy one myself, but it looks
like the colours should be easily distinguishable.

I don't know about the 8 colour cube, but I know for certain that the 12
colour version has already been made. I believ it's called "The Ultimate
Cube", and one was sold on eBay during the summer. L8r.
