The World Puzzle Championship was held last week in Budapest, Hungary.
Erno Rubik was invited to kick off the opening ceremonies (so I got
a few pictures of him, woo hoo!).

There was only one cube-related puzzle in the competition, however.

Contestants were given a picture of an unsolved Rubik's Cube and asked
to identify the center face colors on the unseen three faces.  Perhaps
not too challenging (although I'm sure many will find problem 3 
difficult to do without pencil and paper).  You can find the puzzles
at http://www.rubiks.com/  or the specific URLs:

http://www.rubiks.com/puzzles.html?p=rubiks_cube&q=1
http://www.rubiks.com/puzzles.html?p=rubiks_cube&q=2
http://www.rubiks.com/puzzles.html?p=rubiks_cube&q=3

If you think these puzzles are too easy, I have an added question
for you -- what is the minimum number of moves needed to get a 
solved cube into the states depicted by the three problems?  You will
find problem 1 easy, problem 2 intermediate, and problem 3 difficult.

  the World Puzzle Championship (for the fourth time!)]
