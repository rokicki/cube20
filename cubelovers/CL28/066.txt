I don't know... I found it really distubing that they couldn't even be
bothered to change the sticker to read "Rubik's Revenge" instead of
"Rubik's Cube", and I've heard from some people that the OddzOn version
fell apart as soon as they turned it once. I picked up a Meffert's
version. Not only is it $2 less than the OddzOn version and shipped free
worldwide, but it's also apparently designed for speed cubing. Instead of
using stickers of any kind, Meffert decided to go with tiles for all his
puzzles, which definitely aren't coming off any time soon. To add to the
challenge, Meffert grooved all the tiles, so if you'd like you can also
treat it as a junior version of a picture cube (junior because there's
still pairs of centres which are completely indistibguishable). L8r.
