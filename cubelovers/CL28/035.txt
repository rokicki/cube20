Hi All Cube Lovers,

Just to clarify some point asked below.  I will be releasing original
Siamese cubes, utilizing our Patented Assembly cube parts plus 3 new
connectors so that multiple cubes can be assembled / disassembled. These
will be available for shipping  around the 10th of December.  Also the 4x4x4
cube and our New Pyraminx Diamond Puzzle made from a Skewb mechanism with
new pieces so that you have 6 pyramid apexes and 8 triangles making an
Octahedron. Furthermore there will be bandaged cube with molded tiles
using the assembly cube mechanism. By using the parts of 2 Pyramorphix's I
will be offering a limited number of Star of David and Diamond Puzzles as a
collectors set, also with our new molded tile finish.  Also some New Disney
& Donald Puzzle Heads using our patented 2x2x2 mechanism will be available
soon.

Happy Puzzling
Uwe

Let's keep puzzling alive!
