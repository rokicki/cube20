Subject: Skewb corner malfunctions
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

    After a hard day of solving the skewb for the first time it started to
become loose in my hands and eventually fall apart. As I put it back together
I noticed that the problem was that one of the four corners which are
connected to the internal mechanism would unscrew whenever it was rotated
counter clockwise, eventually causing it to move far enough away from the
mechanism as to cause the pieces to fall away. Is this a problem which has
been encountered by other regular Skewbers? If anyone knows what sort of
mechanism usually keeps the corner attached properly and/or how to fix such
an error I would be grateful.
