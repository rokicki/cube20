Subject: Re: repairing broken cubes

Thanks to all who sent suggestions.  I achieved a successful repair
using a product called 'J-B Weld' and a pin (actually a cut off box
nail.)  The 'J-B Weld' is very strong and hardens almost to the same
hardness as the

original material.  I've been using the cube now for over a week and
it is holding up very well, although it probably is going to wear out
faster now since I take it apart quite often to inspect the repair.
