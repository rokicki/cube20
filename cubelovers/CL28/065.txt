Subject: I got a "new" old cube

I haven't seen many of this posts in this list since most posts are
technical but I thought it wouldn't hurt to share a Cube experience.

Last time I was at a friend's house (a friend I don't visit very often) I
saw a cube laying somewhere and I started playing with it and telling my
friend how I liked the cube, we made a contest to see who could solve it
faster.

The cube is just like the first cube I had, one of those cubes that turn vey
nicely and that the cubies align when you twist the sides, it has stickers
instead of tiles and they are kind of worn off.  My friend says he bought
this cube with his father some 18 or 19 years ago. To me this is an original
cube since here where I live you can not (and never been able to) find those
cubes manufatured by the companies mentioned in this list.

[Moderator's note: The Wonderful Puzzler brand was mentioned in six
 cube-lovers messages from 1981.  Besides the knockoff Rubik's cube,
 they made a keychain version and an octagonal prism version.]

Yesterday I went again to this friend's house and he told me the cube would
be better in my hands and he gave it to me! It comes in its original
cardboard box that reads: Wonderful Puzzler on the top, on two sides it has
a drawing of a scrambled cube and in the other two sides a solved cube and
it reads Can you contend with more than 3,000,000,000 combination (without
the "S") to reach the solution? On the bottom it reads Made in Taiwan

Well thats all a simple story I just wanted to share
