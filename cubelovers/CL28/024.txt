Hi all, I'm new to this list, and new to the cube as well - only got my
first one in March.
Of course, now it doesn't leave my side.

I have seen a few Cube-Lovers emails about solving the cube in a minimum
number of looks. Here is a system that I use to solve the cube in 1 look,
with 10-25 minutes of studying time. (Please excuse my lack of knowledge
of terminology/group theory.)
_________________________________________________

When most people solve the cube they do it by decomposing the whole
problem into successively more specific subgroups. (e.g. first layer
edges, first layer corners, second layer edges, etc.) I say "successively
more specific" because the moves someone would use to position the first
few pieces are very simple and intuitive, usually changing (but not
solving) the unsolved pieces in the cube. As one approaches the solved
state, one uses much more specialized algorithms that affect only the
remaining unsolved pieces.

For "multiple-look" purposes, this is a great approach. Often the smaller
the subgroup of pieces affected by an algorithm, the larger the number of
moves in that algorithm, and since there is usually no perceived order to
the unsolved pieces, there is no benefit to preserving them with lengthy
specialized moves.

To a person visualizing an entire solution in his or her head, however,
these types of moves are very expensive in terms of memory. Instead I
begin from the start using specialized moves that affect as little of the
cube as possible. I might start off with an algorithm to permute 3 corners
(hopefully putting at least two of them in the correct place/orientation)
while leaving the other 5 corners and all 12 edges untouched.

In fact, by the time I have all of the corners solved, the edge pieces are
in exactly the same random configuration as when I started! (with the
possible exception of having interchanged exactly 2 of them.) The solution
has then been decomposed into 2 nearly independent problems.  The moves I
use are mostly single-layer permutations with
some commutators mixed in when necessary.

One can get the corners solved after applying 5 or 6 move sequences, and
then solve the edges with an additional 7 or 8 sequences. (This has
nothing to do with the number of moves used to solve the cube. In fact,
when I solve it with my eyes closed, I average 150-200 moves!)
_____________________________________________________

The Rules:
I would consider it cheating to use a pen and paper. Basically, you have
to sit down with a random cube and look at it for a while without
manipulating it. Then close your eyes and start solving. When you next
open them, it should be solved. (You don't get to "practice" the moves
before you go.)
_____________________________________________________

So, has anyone else tried this?  I'm curious to know what method someone
else uses.  I use my 15 minutes of studying time to plan out where I'm
going to need to move the pieces.  I wonder if anyone with better memory
skills can just memorize the locations of all the pieces and then work out
the entire solution with their eyes closed.
