I agree with Norman's comments.  I recently received two of the new ASSEMBLY
CUBES and they turn very smoothly immediately after assembly.  No
lubricating is required.  The cube is neither too loose nor too tight.  The
use of the metal key to pop a center piece off is quite ingenious.  I'd say
the only cubes that rival the ASSEMBLY CUBE's quality are the 1982-vintage
Deluxe Cubes by Ideal.  They had that springy, elastic feel that was
critical for speed cubing.  Meffert's are definitely the very best
contemporary deluxe cubes around, though.

I can't wait for the transparent version to be available!
