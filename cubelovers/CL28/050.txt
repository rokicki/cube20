The MegaMinx in Puzzler has only 6 colors. When I contacted the author
about it, he told me that the one he got only had those 6 colors. When
I got mine (2 years back), it had 12 colors.

I'm not sure if I've ever run into that problem described above. On second
thought, I have...

Let me describe what I do to solve a MegaMinx. I hope you can follow what
I'm saying, because it's hard to describe this... I'll try to make
some pictures... Ok, I stole one from the alt.ascii-art group:

             _._
         _,-'/\ '-._
    _,.-'1  /2 \   3`-.._
 .'________/____\________'.
 :'-.  4  /      \  6  ,-':
 :   '-, /   5    \ ,-'   :
 :  7   /-.      ,-\   10,:

  :.  /  8 ,-''-. 9  \  .:
  `: /  ,-'      '-.  \ :
 & :/,-'     11     '-.\: %
   `'-................-''


First, I solve one layer. This includes the pieces 1, 2, 3 and 5 on the
5 layers adjeacent to the top. Then, I put in the edge pieces 4 and 6.
Next, I put in the corner pieces 7 and 10. All of these can be done
using standard 3x3x3 moves :-)

Putting in 8 and 9 requires a trick. You have to rotate the layers
indicated by & and % so that the pieces 8 and 9 can be reached from the
'bottom' layer. Then, use standard 3x3x3 moves to swing the edge pieces
from the bottom layer to pieces 8 and 9. I always find this process to
take the longest (you need to put in 10 edges. Because of Murphy's law,
the edge pieces you need are probably in the 'same' positions in other
layers, so you need to take them out before you can put them in. Long
work, indeed).

Next, put in the corner piece 11.

Now, the upper half of the MegaMinx is solved.

Next, put in the edge pieces on the second-to-last layer (easy work),
and we're down to the last layer.

First, I put the edge pieces in the correct _position_. Sometimes, I need
two edges to be swapped. The formula I have excahnges three edges, so I
mess around with it until I have them all in the correct position.

Then, I align edges, position corners (using a three-corner exchange
formula), and align corners. The last two steps usually impose no
problems.

Unfortunately, my notes with Megaminx formulas is at home (we found
them back yesterday..), so I can't look up any formulas.

If people are interested in the formulas I use, or in the way I solve
it, let me know and I'll look up my notes.
