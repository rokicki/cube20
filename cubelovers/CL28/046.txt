Subject: RE: How many Cubes have been sold?

	I'm doing this from memory.  If you want, I can look up what I wrote
about 20 years ago.
	Ideal told me they sold about 20 million cubes in one year - I think
this was in the US.  Polytechnika said they sold about twice (or several) times
as many cubes in Hungary as there were people, making perhaps 10 million.  Both
of these statements were while the cube craze was in midstream.  So I suspect
that somewhere between 50 and 100 million legitimiate cubes were sold.  However
the pirate cubes sold perhaps twice as many.  So I've generally given an
estimate of 200 million!  I think this may be conservative, but the number was
probably somewhere between 100 and 300 million.  This doesn't take account of
the fact that the fad started rather later in the Communist countries and they
may have produced many millions as well, though I don't think this would make a
huge difference to the estimate above.
