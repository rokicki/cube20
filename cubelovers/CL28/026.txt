Subject: Rubik-like puzzles I've never seen before...

[I was referred to this list by someone who read a post I made in the
rec.puzzles newsgroup; I'm not a member of the list, but have some
questions about puzzles I've run across on eBay recently that I'm
curious of their origin.  I thought maybe you'd post my questions
on the list.  Please direct followups to my email address.]

I check out eBay regularly for Rubik's Cube type puzzles I don't have...
Recently I've come across a few I've never seen before -- does anybody
know where they came from?  Or better yet, where I might find them
cheaply, as the prices on eBay seem to be way up there...

1) The Gem/Diamond.  This is an octahedron, but each face is one solid
piece, and it appears to turn in half, turning four triangulars on the
square plan between halves.

2) ??.  This is a 14-sided puzzle, with 8 triangles and 6 squares.  Two
opposite triangles make the "centers" (in 3x3x3 terms), around which
three squares and three triangles turn.  I don't know if ALL triangles
act as centers...  It can be left "unshaped" similar to Square-1, only
not so jarringly.

3) Siamese Cube.  This was an old hack in the 80s, with two normal cubes
sharing a row of two corners and an edge, but these look professionally
made, and are made out of the new OddzOn cubes apparently.  They come
with a display case.

4) "Triple" Cube.  This is similar to the Siamese Cube, only there are
three cubes connected, and unlike the Siames Cube, each new cube rises
a level -- a row of one corner and an edge are aligned with the next
cube's edge and the other corner (ie one is bottom corner and edge,
joining the other cube's edge and top corner).  This also comes with
a display case.

The mechanism for the Gem is likely just a 2x2x2 cube mechanism, but the
pieces?  The 14-sider looks ALL new, though with 8 centers, maybe it's
some kind of octahedron shape variation?

With the Siamese and Triple cubes you could just have a few different
pieces swapping out the originals -- is someone just making the new
pieces?

Are these homemade, prototypes, original puzzles by pirate manufacturers?
Does anybody know?
