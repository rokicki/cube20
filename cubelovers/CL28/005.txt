Dear Cube Lovers,

I just joined the cube lovers' society. So, here's a bit of a cv: I
started Cubology after the first cubes were marketed in Germany. I'm a
member of the NKC, the dutch cube club. Cube Lovers who are members
too and read CFF, (standing for Cubism For Fun - the NKC's
publication) know me either from meetings at the annual Cube Days or
from the articles, I published in CFF.  Since I have a PC with an AMD
K6-III/450MHz and 128 RAM, I can run Herbert Kociemba's "Cube Explorer
and the add-on programme "Cube Optimizer", which re-activated my
interest in Pretty Patterns by looking for new species and finding
shorter manoeuvers of those that are in my almost 20 years old
collection. The results are amazing: I discover entirely new Pretties
and shorten lots of existing algorithms.
Here are a few of my recent discoveries:
R2 B2 U' L' B D' B R2 D2 L' F' D R2 U2  (14f*)
D2 U L' B L2 B' L U' B D2 B2 U2 B' F' U2  (15f*)

U' F U2 F2 L' D2 B L2 D R F2 L' U' R2 B' F2 D' (17)
If you are a hunter of Pretties, please let me know and my recent
findings are yours! Obviously, I'd appreciate to be informed about
cubological developments from other fellow Cube Lovers. 3x3x3, 4x4x4
and 5x5x5 cube info's are welcome indeed.

Cubology to you!
Ronald Fletterman, a Dutchman living in Warburg, Germany.
