I received an email from Meffert about new Puzzles :
(he mentions doing a version of a 4x4x4)

"Other puzzles that I will be making for Xmas are the Siamese Twin assembly
cube, Pyraminx Diamond, (8 sides, Skewb mechanism)  The Star of David
(Pyramorphix mechanism) and a Dodecahedron with each face being divided into
4 segments, (Skewb mechanism).

All new Puzzles will feature a molded tile finish."

WOW.....GREAT NEWS!!
