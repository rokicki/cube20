Joe,

The guy to talk to is Christoph Bandelow.  His email address is

   mailto:Christoph.Bandelow@ruhr-uni-bochum.de

(I'm pretty sure he monitors the list.)  He is located in Germany and
has a bunch of other puzzles that I'm sure you will be interested in.
He is very prompt with delivering orders, and is very easy to work
with.

My Rubik's Revenge sat broken on the shelf for about 15 years.  After
contacting Christoph, my Rubik's Revenge is as good as new!  Not to
mention that I now have a few more puzzles that I didn't have before. 
Buy a few of his puzzles (5^3's etc.), and he might give you a good
deal on the 4^3 replacement parts.

Hope this helps.

-Darin

P.S.  Let us know how everything turns out.  I'm sure there are other
people in the same boat.
