Subject: 5X5X5 challenge

I recently bought my first 5X5X5 Rubik's Cube (from  Meffert's) and when
I received it, the first thing I noticed was that the stickers had
little grooves in them and all of them on each face were lined up in the
same direction.  After I learned how to solve the cube for color I
decided to try to solve it so that all of the little grooves lined up.
After much hard work I finally got it and can repeat the solution.  It
is a wonderful challenge after you've grown tired of solving it the
'normal' way!  I won't give the solution unless I see that there is
interest in it here in this list

[Moderator's note: See "Supergroup" in the archives.  If you want to
experience the full measure of complication, mark the a corner of
twelve facelets on each face in this pattern:

    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    |     |   .'|`.   |   .'|`.   |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |   `.|.'   |   `.|.'   |
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    |     |   .'|`.   |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     |   `.|.'   |     |     |
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

and make them line up afterwards.  You'll learn something surprising
about the center facelets. --Dan ]
