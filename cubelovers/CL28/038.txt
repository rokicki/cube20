Subject: Alison painted me a giant rubiks cube!

The big green composter in the yard has
been transformed!  And it looks fabulous!

ye kindred spirits who love cubes might
understand how cool it is to have a giant
two foot rotating rubiks cube decomposing
vegetable matter in my front yard.  wow!

you can view a snapshot of it at the end of
this weeks update at wunderland.com.

I've got another one, that measures only about
a foot and a half:
