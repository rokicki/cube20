That's kind of what I thought.  The OddzOn cubes are represented by
http://www.rubiks.com, right?  Or is it just on Hasbro's site somewhere?

Yep, I found Meffert's site.  I hear he's also planning 4x4x4 & 5x5x5
(assembly?) cubes, which is pretty neat.

So you get 2 "new" puzzles out of 2 Pyramorphix?  Hmm, pure profit...

Someone postulated that it's a dual of the Skewb, and it strikes me that
might be true.  Opinion?

Well, it can be left in even more contorted shapes than the Siamese Cube...

I'm already trying to get a bunch of doodles ready for Noel to add... :-)

Sure!  I'll send him a note and ask.  Thanks for the pointer.

Thanks for the address!  Tony was mentioned to me by a couple other sources.
Does anyone know if Tony has an email address or a URL?

Pete Beck had suggested the same thing, but that's definitely not it.  I've
seen those before, and one characteristic is that the planes cute through
the squares & triangles; on this one there are NO cuts through the faces.

It's not on any active auctions any more, but Noel put it in his Puzzler
program, and it looks right.

Hmm, are there pix of these anywhere?  Are the just twinned at the corners?

I assume you mean Siamese Cubes, but not Siamese Skewbs.  If SS, I couldn't
find the posts...

Yep, I found that via www.rubiks.com Forum...

I'm not sure I have the talent to mold pieces, but I could mail you some
notes about 2x2x3, 3x3x4 and triangular prism mechanisms...  :-)

Glad to hear it.  Tell me though, is there any chance we'll see some of
the puzzles from the OLD Meffert catalogs -- like the triangular,
hexagonal, pentagonal and the two circular, prisms?

It occurs to me that even though there isn't an auction running currently
with that, you could search for it.  Trouble is, the title was something
lame like "blah blah Rubik blah blah EXTREMELY RARE", which will match
other stuff too...  On the other hand, it might have been auctioned by
the same ssongas (sp?) guy who's auctioning off the Siamese/Triple/Gem
puzles, so a search for him in completed auctions might find it.  I can't
get to the web right now to do it myself, but will try to look later.
Actually, it might have said "14-sided" in the title, which would be
easy to find...

What company is that?

Well, I guess I meant like the Siamese cubes still requiring two cubes to
make one Siamese, so the cubes to make it would be pirated, even if the SC
itself wasn't.  Same with the Pyramorphix going to the Gem & Starburst.
But point taken.  And in this case, obviously somebody with a good supply
of OddzOn cubes and ?? Pyramorphix and some time & talent out to make a
good buck or a hundred.


Again, thanks all!
