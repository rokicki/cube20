Subject: RE: Skewb notes

	Regarding disassembly of the skewb and the various skewballs.
	The early versions disassemble quite easily and when I put them out at
exhibition, I regularly have to reassemble them.  However, I have just learned
from Yee Dian Lee at the International Puzzle Party that the more recent
skewballs are quite hard to take apart and he finds that he has to break a
piece in order to do so!  He puts them inside jars!
