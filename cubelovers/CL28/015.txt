Yes, the grooving effect shows up quite strikingly against the light
as two distinct shades and allows some nice pretty patterns.  Since
there are only two apparent alternatives, whereas there are four
possible orientations, some possibilities look a little surprising, to
my eyes at least.  Thus a three-cycle of centre pieces shows up as a
change to just two pieces.
