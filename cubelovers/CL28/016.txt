Subject: Strange way to solve cube
Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1999 01:15:45 -0500

I received a Magic catalog with the following trick:

Oral Fix-Sational

Bring out a miniature Rubik's cube. It's completely mixed up.
Place the Rubik's cube in your mouth! Yummy!
Roll the cube around in your mouth. This way, then that. Up
then down. It looks relly weird.
Now, Open your mouth and push the cube out. It is completely
solved!
Do it surronded. It resets in seconds. No shell is used.
Oral Fix-Sational from Ed Alonzo, comes with complete instructions
and the 1-1/4" gimmicked cube. $15.00
