Dear Terrence

I am sorry to hear that you are one of the very few persons experiencing
problem with the Skewb. I believe that you are actually the first. Even so
there have a few identical problems with the Prof.cube.

What unfortunately happened is that when gluing the corner cap excess
glue fixed the screw to the plastic corner piece that it should turn
in.  So when you turn this section it will tighten / loosen that one
screw.

If you are skilful enough you can try and carefully remove the corner
cap to expose the screw that has become loose.  Then try to remove the
excess glue from around the screw with a sharp object and try turning
the screw with a screwdriver firmly holding the plastic piece so you
can break the glue bond.  Once the screw can freely turn inside the
plastic part, re-tighten it to the same tension as it was originally,
so as to allow smooth turning without any pieces falling out during
play.  Then carefully using only very little glue fix the corner cap
back into place.

Please let me know the outcome of this recommended procedure. If you can't
fix it please let me know and I will send you a free replacement.

Sorry for any frustration and inconvenience caused.

Good Luck and Happy Puzzling.


With warm regards
Uwe
