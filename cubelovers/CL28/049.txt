Subject: Megaminx 2 edge swap
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

For a long time i thought and heard that the 2 edge swap was impossible on a
megaminx as it is simply a platonic dodecahedron in rubiks format, and a 2
edge swap on a rubiks cube is impossible. yet i have many times solved my
megaminx down to where there are only 2 edges swapped, then randomized it,
and solved again only to find the problem nonexistant. apparently there is
some way to swap only two edges. If anyone knows this move sequence please
tell me. thank you.

[Moderator's note: It is impossible to perform an odd permutation of
 the edges of the Megaminx, because 5-cycles are even.  This is not
 the same situation as with Rubik's cube, where it is possible to
 perform an odd permutation of the edges if an odd permutation of the
 corners is also performed.  Did they use the same color for more than
 one face of the Megaminx?  Is there another way to get fooled? --Dan]
