Subject: Ideas for new puzzles

Dear Cube-Lovers,

  As I twist and turn, I often think, wouldn't it be great
if this puzzle did this.  After discovering Jaap Scherphuis'
page on puzzle info, I thought I should put my ideas forward.
If these have already appeared, then please don't take offense,
I am not stealing, just reinventing the wheel.  If anyone knows
if these puzzles already exist, I would very much appreciate
hearing about them.  If these puzzles don't exist, then I
offer my ideas as a challenge to any puzzle manufacturers, and
puzzle designers, who may read this news letter.

  As I twisted my skewb, to prove to myself that it is very
similar to the Magic Pyramid, I thought, I would like to swap
corners from one group (of 4) to the other group.  Super-
imposing the cuts of a 2x2x2 cube on the skewb would do this.
Each face would consist of 8 triangles.  Allowed twists would
be the 120 degree twist of the skewb and the 90 degree twist
of the 2x cube, only.  Stopping at 45 degrees or 60 degrees would
not allow a twist in a new direction to begin.  Any number
of 90 degree cube twists could follow any number of 120 degree
of skewb twists, followed by 90 degree twists, etc.

  My second idea/wish is a Dogic, but using 20 colors, rather than
12 colors.  Each face of 3 triangles (plus insert), would be
a unique color.  The main challenge I see in making this, is
choosing 20 easily distinguishable colors.  I like the 12 Dogic
color choices very much, because, to my eyes, they are easily
distinguishable, (in contrast to one of my skewbs that has 2
shades of orange for adjoining sides).

  2 ideas that I am currently building are an 8 color cube
and 12 color cube using Mefferts assembly cubes and tiles.
The 8 color is the corner centered design, and the 12 color
is an edge centered design.  These appeared in an early
Scientific American article.

  Does anyone in Cube-Lovers have a Web Page to collect ideas
of the group for future puzzle designs?

Howard Drake
