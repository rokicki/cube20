To all CubeLovers.

I am conducting a color survey for a revised color scheme for the new molded
tiles that I am preparing for some of our Puzzles for Xmas.

The final choice will be based on the majority of the suggestions received
from CubeLovers like you.

Megaminx: do you prefer 6 colors or 12 colors;  If 12, which colors?

Prof. cube & new improved 4x4x4 cube: any color preferences?

Looking forward to hearing from you all, your input is important as this is
most likely the last time that I will run some of these Items.

The other good news is that I have finally been persuaded to release several
new puzzles for Xmas.  More later

With warm regards to all
Uwe


Let's keep puzzling alive!
