Subject: 2x2x4 cube-like puzzle?

Somewhere I ran across mention of a 2x2x4 cube, made from a 4x4x4 with
some pieces glued together.  It gave a link:

>http://hjem.get2net.dk/philip-k/puzzles/puzzlist.htm

There was no pic as the referring doc said, but it says it was made by
Greg Stevens -- is Greg around here and/or are there actually pix out
there somewhere?

On the other hand, another site (http://www.puzzleshop.de ??) has pix
of what appears to actually be a 2x2x4 puzzle in its Puzzle Museum.
How does that work?
