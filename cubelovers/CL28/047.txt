Subject: Square-1 Question

Greetings:

After many months of trying pattern after pattern, I've developed an
algorithm for swapping two adjacent corner pieces on Square-1. I was hoping
that if I posted what I've come up with, that someone might have an easier
method. Who knows? Maybe I've just put a new spin on an old solution to this
move, or re-discovered an existing pattern. Anyhow, I'd love to get some
feedback on it. Here's what I've got:

* All moves are done with the orange side facing you, yellow on the left.
* T   = Top Slice [white in this case]
* R   = Right-Hand Slice [blue]
* B   = Bottom Slice [green]
* L   = Left-Hand Slice [yellow]
* CW  = Clock Wise
* CCW = Counter Clock Wise
* CW and CCW moves are done from the perspective of tilting the cube and
looking at the side in question.
* This series of moves will swap the two bottom corner pieces on the blue
side.

T [1/8 CW], R [1/2], B [1/4 CCW], T [1/2], R [1/2], B [1/4 CW], T [1/2], R
[1/2], B [1/4 CCW], T [1/2], R [1/2], B [1/4 CCW], T [1/4 CW], L [1/2], T
[1/4 CW], L [1/2], T [1/8 CW], B [1/2]

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. Now that I have
my own, I won't mind borrowing a simpler one!
