Subject: Meffert's web-site

Hi,

I've tried to go to Uwe Meffert's web-site, but have been unable to
open it (http://www.mefferts-puzzles.com). Also, I tried www.ue.net
(another site made by Meffert). Does anyone know why the sites are
down?

[Moderator's note: CvW followed up with a note that the site is now
 named www.mefferts.com. --Dan]

On a side note, this weekend I 'constructed' a 12-spot on a Megaminx.
It's not as simple as it looks. After that, I constructed the
pattern that looks like U2 D2 R2 L2 F2 B2 on the Cube (is this
called 'Pons Asinorum'?). Only, the colors are not always the ones
of the oposite sides of the MegaMinx.

Is it possible to make the 12-spot and the other pattern in an easy
way when I start with a 'clean' MegaMinx? I've seen formulas for
the 10-spot already.


Regards,

Christ van Willegen
