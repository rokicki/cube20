Subject: Pocket Stuff

[Possibly minimal relevance; take it in the sense of cool stocking-stuffer
hacks.]

Someone asked a couple of weeks back for pocket/key-ring cubes.  Can't help
with that, but this afternoon in Sandy's and Son's (Inman Square (Cambridge
(Ma))) beside the cash register they had a basket of EtchASketch keyrings.
Seemed pretty solidly built for the the $3.50.
