I received the following mail from KINSMAN.  I did not reply to 
him or make note of his address.  I am retyping his note to get 
comment from others.  He is refering to the WrisTwist puzzle.


I have just such a puzzle too.  It came from my local toy store. 
 I also have a digital camera sitting next to me.  Should I bring 
mine in and post a low resolution copy in GIF format to the 
group?  -AAK


Does anyone want him to do this?
