Yes, I have a Luminations, but no I don't know where to get one.  They 
haven't been on the shelves for about three years.  Someone on this list 
has got to have two of them.  Would the list administrator be opposed to 
some good old-fasioned commerce?  I'll bet for everybody that's looking 
for something there are three people who have an extra one.
