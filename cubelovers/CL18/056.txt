Hi
 
My new puzzles are out again.  Here's a brief description:
  5.1
    Mball and Mlink puzzles now draw sectors faster.
    All puzzles have a corrected random number generator for 64 bit
      machines.
    Border color around tiles/pieces makes it look more realistic.
    g (& G) for get of old saved configuration (not e).
    Many other cosmetic changes in the code.  I am getting it in sync
      with MSWindows code (winpuzz).

I hope I don't regret announcing this:  :)
  I am busy porting them to MSWindows.  So far I only ported one, "xcubes".
  I think the rest will be easier now that I have my X-Window-System code
  in sync.  I am looking for anyone with MSWindows AND C experience to Beta
  test and give me some pointers.  (If I could get a small team that would
  be great!)  The executable AND source for MSWindows, when completed will
  be freely redistributable and maintained (as far as I am able to).  So
  far, I am only using windows.h (3.1) to maximize portablity and compiler
  independance.
 
Cheers,
  /X\   David A. Bagley
