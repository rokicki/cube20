Hello, 

I just joined this group and I thought that I would throw out a
place here in San Francisco where one can find some interesting things 
(such as the elusive 5x5x5 cube).

Game Gallery
One Embarcadero Center
Street Level
San Francisco, CA  94102

(415) 433-4263

Also, there is a second-hand store on the corner of 17th and Mission 
which seems to have some type of mix-up-and-fix puzzle every time I go 
in.  Let me know what people are looking for and I'll keep an eye out for it.

Later, 


Joe
