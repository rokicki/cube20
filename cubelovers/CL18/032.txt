I purchased one of these back in 1992 at a toystore in a
Florida mall.  I paid $4.99 for mine.  The tags says:

WrisTwist (tm)
Puzzle & Bracelet

WACO
Riverdale, NJ 07457
Made in Indonesia
Item #20003

The puzzle is still in its pristine state and the color progression is:

Red-Blue-Green-Yellow-OrangeRed-Violet-Orange-LightGreen
