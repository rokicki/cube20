In Sept. 1992 Mark Longridge described an idea he had for a 
puzzle.  He called it a Twist Torus.  Well I bought a puzzle that 
fits his description very closely.  I would have sent this in 
sooner except that I am new to Cube Lovers.  I bought mine 
several years ago.  Did he get his design into production or was 
it independently invented or did someone implement Mark's idea?  
Will we ever know?  I bought mine in a department store (cant 
remember which) toy department.  It was not in any packaging and 
cost less than $2 US..  They only had one.  It was quite by 
chance that I determined that it is a puzzle.

It will test my ability to describe it in words but here goes.  
It is torus shaped (dough nut shaped).  At first glance it looks 
like a bracelet.  It has one slice made the same way a bagel is 
sliced.  The puzzle can turn along this cut.  There are eight 
differently colored sections separated by fixed black sections 
around the circumference of the torus.  Each colored section is 
subdivided into 4 sub-segments that can turn at right angles to 
the main circumference.  As a segment is turned, different parts 
of the segment are brought to the other side of the main cut.

It operates smoothly and is brightly colored.  It is fairly easy 
to solve but the geometry is novel and interesting.

Does anyone else have one of these?  Does anyone know who 
manufactured this?  Does anyone know what it is called?
