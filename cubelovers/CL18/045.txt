I bought one from him before Ideal's stuff appeared in stores, so I
think he can be considered to have beaten them.  However, when he
re-sized the tabs on the cubies so that the cube wouldn't seem ready
to explode, I think Ideal was shipping.  I wonder what happened to
him during the cube's other explosion (i.e. popularity) let alone
the bust.
