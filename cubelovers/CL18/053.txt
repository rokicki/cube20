The only facelet for which invisible orientation changes are even
possible is the center facelet on an odd-order cube.  Other facelets
always have a fixed orientation with respect to the center of the face
they're on at the moment.  (On the 4x4x4, for example, if you mark
every facelet for orientation, you will find that each center facelets
always has the same corner to the face center, regardless of which face
it's on.)
