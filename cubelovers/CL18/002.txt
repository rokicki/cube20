48.

first note that any homomorphism  G  -->  S_n  can be factored as

           G  -->  S_m_1 x S_m_2 x ... x S_m_k  >-->  S_n

where  m_1, m_2, ... , m_k  are the sizes of the orbits of  G  acting
on  {1, 2, ... , n},  and thus  m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_k = n.
furthermore, the action of  G  on each  {1, 2, ... , m_i}  is
transitive.

transitive  G-sets  are easy to understand.  for any subgroup  H  of  G,
G  acts transitively on the cosets  G/H  by left multiplication.
also, any transitive  G-set  is of this form.  given a homomorphism
G  -->  S_m  with a transitive action, let  H  be the subgroup of  G
that fixes the element  1.  then it's easy to see that the cosets  G/H
are in one-to-one correspondence with elements in the orbit of  1
(which by hypothesis are all of  1, 2, ... , m)  and the action of
G  on  G/H  is isomorphic to the action of  G  on  {1, 2, ... , m}.

the kernel of the homomorphism  G --> sym(G/H)  is the largest normal
subgroup of  G  contained in  H , which is just the intersection of
all  G-conjugates  of  H.

of course, in this case we have  m = (G : H)  (index of  H  in  G).
thus michiel's question can be settled by considering all subgroups of
G  with index less than 48.

unless i've overlooked some, there are exactly 8 such, up to  G-conjugacy.
they are

     G     itself
     G'    = commutator subgroup of  G  =  subgroup of positions an even
             number of quarter turns from start
     C_0   = subgroup where the corner  UFR  is in place, but may be twisted
     C'_0  = commutator subgroup of  C_0  =  intersection of  C_0  and  G'
     E_0   = subgroup where the edge  UR  is in place, but may be flipped
     E'_0  = commutator subgroup of  E_0  =  intersection of  E_0  and  G'
     C_1   = subgroup where the corner  UFR  is in place and is not twisted
     E_1   = subgroup where the edge  UR  is in place and is not flipped.

for each of these, except the last two, the kernel of  G --> sym(G/H)
contains all elements that only flip edges in place and twist corners
in place.
                                                                   number of
  subgroup   index       kernel                                   conjugates

     G         1           G                                           1
     G'        2           G'                                          1
     C_0       8      {all corners in place, may be twisted}           8
     C'_0     16      {all corners in place, may be twisted}           8
     E_0      12      {all edges in place, may be flipped}            12
     E'_0     24      {all edges in place, may be flipped}            12
     C_1      24      {all corners in place, may not be twisted}       8
     E_1      24      {all edges in place, may not be flipped}        12

thus the only way to get and embedding (i.e. injective homomorphism)
G --> S_n  using the subgroups above is

            G --> sym(G/C_1) x sym(G/E_1) >--> S_48

which in fact, is just the action of  G  on the 48 non-center facelets.

i had previously stumbled across this exact same question, so 
now i'm curious: why are you interested in this?
