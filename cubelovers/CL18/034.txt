   can anybody please tell me the correct email-adresse
   for sending an unsubscribe-command?

   thanks - Roger

As I'm certain you've been told -multiple- times, the address is:

  CUBE-LOVERS-REQUEST@AI.MIT.EDU

For crying out loud, why can't people remember that?

Let me give everybody a little bit of advice.  For every mailing list you
subscribe to, keep a file that contains the information you will need in
order to cancel or update your subscription.  This isn't hard to do.  I do
it myself.  It's a great way to avoid looking foolish in front of hundreds
of people.  If you don't have such a file for Cube-Lovers already, start
one RIGHT NOW and put this message in it.
