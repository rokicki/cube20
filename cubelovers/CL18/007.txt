This has nothing to do with his question, but one of my old
cubes has become so loose that it has become quite easy to twist
a single corner piece - no doubt other people have expierenced
this phenomenon.

The last stage in my cube-solving algorithm used to be orienting
the corners - this has now become trivial. :)
