Subject: Lumination

Has anyone seen a puzzle called Lumination by Parker Bros.  A
guy at work says he got one from his wife about five years ago.
It is a tetrahedron (like the Pyraminx) except that instead of
having any moving parts, it has lights in the four points that
change color when you rotate the whole puzzle in space.

It sounds really neat.  Does anyone know where I can get one?
