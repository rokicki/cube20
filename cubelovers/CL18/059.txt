Happy New Year from TeleGrafix:

     Since you are an important colleague of ours in the online media 
community, TeleGrafix is sending this short news release to brief you 
about an important new Internet technology.  

     Following two years of development, TeleGrafix Communications 
is giving away free communications software that allows you to use 
the new RIPscrip-2 (Remote Imaging Protocol-2 scripting language) 
Internet online multimedia technology.  

     We invite you to sample "RIP-2" multimedia on TeleGrafix's 
Vector Sector BBS at (714) 379-2133.  To fully experience it, please 
download the "shareware" RIPterm v2.2 communications software 
from the BBS.  RIP-2 technical data and RIPterm v2.2 also are 
available for download at http://www.telegrafix.com on the World 
Wide Web.  Browser "plug-ins" to permit viewing of RIP-2 
multimedia on the Web are slated for release in early 1996. 

     RIP-2 enables you to create TV-style multimedia presentations or 
electronic newspapers that fly through the Internet and ordinary 
phone lines at dazzling speeds using regular modems.  RIP-2 encodes 
graphics as hyper-compressed ASCII text files that are as little as 
one-tenth the size of other formats.  It works on any computing 
platform or communications network that uses 7-bit or 8-bit ASCII 
text.  We expect RIP-2 to quickly become an important Internet 
technical standard like HTML, Java or VRML.  

     TeleGrafix is now accepting requests from software developers 
and online system operators who want copies of the RIP-2 Internet 
multimedia language specification when it is published in early 1996.  
The first generation of RIP technology, introduced in 1993, is the 
world's BBS graphics standard. It is used on thousands of BBS 
systems, and is supported by dozens of online software vendors 
including Delrina, Galacticomm, Hayes and Mustang. 

If this message has reached you in error or if you are no longer 
interested in RIPscrip technology,  please tell us via E-mail so you 
won't get additional information. We look forward to helping you, 
and we wish you a Happy New Year. 

     Sincerely,

     Pat Clawson          Mark Hayton         Jeff Reeder
     President/CEO        VP/Technology       Chairman & CyberWizard
