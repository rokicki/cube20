Does anyone have or know where to get Rubik's Magic:  The Second 
Challange?  It is a larger version of the Link the Rings puzzle.  I see 
it advertised in a little flyer that came with Link the Rings, but I have 
never seen a real one.  Also the 4x4x4 Rubik's Revenge eludes capture.  
Happy New Year everyone.

Joe
