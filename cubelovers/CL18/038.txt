Sigh...

Please don't mail stuff like this to a list.  If you want to distribute it,
fine; I'm sure there are people who are glad to have it.  In that case
either set up an FTP site or --lacking that-- post an
announcement/invitation and let those who want things like this send you
mail and then you can post to them directly.  But the last thing most of us
need on a dreary friday morning is another 50k bit-bomb in our mailbox.
