no, yes (otherwise), no, and yes, respectively.

we have seen this pattern several times recently.  this is one of 
those positions with 16 symmetries.  i called it "four pluses" in my 
message of may 11 (although i gave it in a different orientation)

)     four pluses                 ( R2 F2 R2 U'D F2 R2 F2 UD' )

in fact, this maneuver is minimal in both the quarter turn and the
face turn metrics, so its length is  16q, 10f.  it is a weak local
maximum in the face turn metric; one can check that no minimal
maneuver ends with the face turn R.  however, using the 16 symmetries
which preserve the  U-D axis, and inversion, we can give minimal
maneuvers which end with turns of any of the six faces.  this shows
that it's a weak local maximum in the face turn metric.  local
maximality in the quarter turn metric follows in a similar manner.

also, mark pointed out on april 16 that this position lies in the
center of the antislice group.
