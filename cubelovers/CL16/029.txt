Perhaps I should have quoted a little more from _Symmetry and
Local Maxima_.  Here is the T-symmetric position given by
Saxe and Hoey.  In their position, the UFL and RBD corners are
in place, and the other three pairs are swapped.  The "girdle"
includes the three pairs that are swapped.  Hence, there
is an axis of symmetry along the UFL-RBD axis.  The odd number of
swaps is compensated by an odd number in the edges.  The compensation
is not required for corners only.
