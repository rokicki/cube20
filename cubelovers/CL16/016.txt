Subject: Dinosaur Rubik's Cube

Hi
  I just just added new modes to my xdino puzzle.  It is the Rubik's
Dinosaur Puzzle recently mentioned.  (A cube with diagonal X cuts.)
In addition to the Period 3 movement it now has a Period 2 movement with
the faces cut up like:
   ___
  |\ /|
  | X |
  |/ \|
   ---
as opposed to just
   \ /
    X
   / \
In the Period 3 movement the cube turns around a corner while in Period 2
movement it turns around the center of an edge.
 
Of course if you want to make it harder there is a "Both" mode where
you can have both turning modes at once.
 
I would like to thank Derek Bosch <bosch@sgi.com> for suggesting the
Period 2 movement -> Bosch's Cube :)
 
I spent a good 10 minutes trying to solve Bosch's Cube and did
not get anywhere.  The Period 3 seems easier.  Be the first in the
Universe to solve it. :)
 
All those who have X should be able to run it.  There are many other
puzzles in the collection as well.
 
Any problems with the compilation or bugs ... let me know.
 
Cheers,
