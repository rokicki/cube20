> Does anyone on Cube-Lovers have that book?

Yes, I do.

The illustrations cover:
Rubik himself, Polytoys, Konsumex, cubes, books, cube-related items
(stickers, pencils, lp's, earrings, t-shirts...)
There is an article on a competition in 1982 in Budapest.
And many more articles I don't understand a word of.
