 > Summarizing information I received from Rik van Grol, Editor of CFF.

I add some information:

 > Rik estimated the cost as 145 Dutch Guilders, though this is unconfirmed.
 > Club membership (1995) 30 Guilders.
 > Orders to Treasurer of the club.  (same address as in archives)

# 1-13 NLD 20,- (these are in Dutch, no translation available), the remainder
is in English and sold per year (NLD 5,- for each issues, #25 counts as 5
issues):
#14-16 NLD 15,- (1987)
#17-19 NLD 15,- (1988)
#20-22 NLD 15,- (1989)
#23-25 NLD 35,- (1990)
#27    NLD  5,- (1991)
#28-30 NLD 15,- (1992)
#31-32 NLD 10,- (1993)
#33-35 NLD 15,- (1994)

#26 was never issued (or was it 27?, I disremember).  Total cost English
issues only: NLD 125,-; including Dutch issues NLD 145,-.  So Rik's
estimate is correct.  1995 has upto now #36 and #37.
