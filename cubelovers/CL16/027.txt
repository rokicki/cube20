Subject:   Re: A Third Way to Calculate the Real Size of Cube Space?
In-Reply-To: Message of 06/17/95 at 17:18:00 from BRYAN@wvnvm.wvnet.edu

I should have said "a fourth way", I think.  Martin Schoernert
performed the same calculation with GAP.  Hence, we have three
ways in hand: 1) Dan's Polya-Burnside method, 2) Martin's GAP
calculations, and 3) brute force computer search.  My new
proposal would then be a fourth way.

Here is a question for Martin: is there any way with GAP to calculate
the number of M-conjugacy classes associated with each symmetry class?
It is this additional information about the "real cube space" which
*is* available via computer search, and for which I am proposing
an alternative which does not involve computer search.
