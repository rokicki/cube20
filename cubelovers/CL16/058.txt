Sort of a strange question -- but at this point I don't know who else to ask. 

Does anyone know how I could get more of those little 25-cm 3x3x3 cubes that
used to be sold on a keychain for about US $3.00? I checked a few toy and
novelty stores in my area, including Games People Play near MIT in Cambridge
(and they weren't very nice about giving me a useful answer either)... 

Barring that, has anyone successfully made their own cubes? Since the 3x3x3
is relatively simple in design I suppose the tolerances wouldn't be all that
bad. 

I'd like to get a bunch of small cubes so I can keep a bunch of cubes in
different configurations. 

Yes, I am reading through the 15-year backlog and am only up to mid-December
1980. I did some grep -i searches for "key\ *chain", "mold" and "cast"  but
found nothing helpful.
