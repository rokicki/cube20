Hmmmmm, that's very interesting.

Below is my interpretation of "...corners on the girdle are swapped
with their opposites as well." Let's call it pattern X.

        D U D
        U U U
        D U D
F L B   R F L   B R F   L B R
L L L   F F F   R R R   B B B
F L B   R F L   B R F   L B R
        U D U
        D D D
        U D U

If I understand the terminology correctly, then for this pattern
X = |{m'Xm}|=3 and |Symm(X)|=16, same as the 4 spot.
Also X = |{c'Xc}|=3.

But perhaps this is not the same pattern....

Let's call this next cube arrangement pattern Y.

        F U U
        U U U
        D U L
R L B   R F B   D R R   B B D
L L L   F F F   R R R   B B B
U L L   F F U   L R F   L B F
        D D B
        D D D
        R D U

Y = |{m'Ym}|=4 and |Symm(Y)|=12, and Y=|{c'Yc}| = 4

This pattern was created by swapping 3 pairs of diametrically opposite
corners, which is in the *swap* orbit on a normal cube, but since we
are dealing with corners of Rubik's cube and ignoring edges we can
realize permutations with an odd number of pairs of corners swapped.
