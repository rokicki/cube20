The position is called T-symmetric in Dan's taxonomy (actually,
there are four T subgroups of M, T1 through T4).  The symmetry
is related to opposite corners, e.g., the UFL-DRB axis,
which is why there are four T subgroups.

Also, the position is Q-transitive, so you can check it out
in _Symmetry and Local Maxima_.  I quote ".... each edge on the
girdle may be swapped with the diametrically opposite edge,
provided that the corners on the girdle are swapped with
their opposites as well."   Here, you would fix the edges and
pay attention only to the swapping of the corners.
