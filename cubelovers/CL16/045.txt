And worse, it's not even 4^4, since there are two ways to align the face
centers so that the puzzle looks solved.  The two unmarked faces are
opposite each other, and the four marked faces are marked with symbols
(Rubik's signature, his silouette, "C*4^4", and the "Rubik's Cube"
trademark) that have a definite "up", but don't tie in to the rest of the
cube at all.  If all four are upside down, to "solve" the cube simply
requires turning the cube over.
