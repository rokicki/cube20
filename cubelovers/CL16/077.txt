5x5x5 Rubik's Cubes are available for $20 (regularly $30) from Ishi Press
International.  They have two flaws (which is why I am selling them for $20
and not $30).  First, the orange stickers have a tendency to slide.  This can
be fixed by putting a piece of wax paper over the orange stickers and heating
them slightly with a clothes iron, just enough to melt the glue and reset it.
Second, the middle cube faces have a tendency to fall off.  Remove them and
put them back on with a bit of glue.


Always feel free to write me if you have any questions or comments.
