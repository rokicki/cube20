What you saw was "Rubik's Cube 4th Dimension."  This was released some
time in the early 90s.  The only difference between this and the typical 3x3x3
is that four faces have pictures on their center squares, requiring 
the solver to orient them correctly.  

I belive last year there was a European Rubik Puzzle series that rereleased
the cube, along with other rubik puzzles.

I have a proof that NP = P; however, it requires exponential time to write down.
