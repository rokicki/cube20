I have also noticed that the discussion on the "shallow-cut dodecahedron" 
a.k.a. Hungarian "super nova" has come and gone a couple times. What I'm
talking about is a puzzle that looks like a Platonic dodecahedron (12
pentagonal faces) cut like

and manipulated by turning a face 72 degrees around its axis of 5-fold
rotational symmetry (an operation that moves 5 edge pieces and 5 corner
pieces).

I'd like to cast the parts for one of these as well. It seems that the only
difficult part would be the 12-pointed "spindle" that holds all the center
pieces. It has to be strong, rigid and perfectly aligned. The easiest thing
would be to screw bolts into a 12-sided die (of the D&D variety) but I think
the alignment would be too poor.

Oh, yes of course I meant to say 25 mm, not 25 cm. <-:
   Of course, a 25-cm cube would be fun to have, too. I imagine it would be
about a 25x25x25, which would have about 7.3 * 10^2328 combinations (even
without considering face centers). God's Number would be well over 1000, and
even "Pons Asinorum" would be a major effort at 150 QTW. Since it's an
odd-order cube, it could be built by the simplistic "sextapole magnet" 
method (each cubie has a north pole on its inward-pointing faces and a south
pole on its outward-pointing faces, except for the cubiess on the three
central planes which could be hollow steel) [-8

Sort of a minimalist approach... but I have a notebook for recording
patterns. Most of what I want to do involves having a bunch of cubes in the
same pattern, then performing different transformations on each one and
comparing the results.

More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for
all other causes combined.
