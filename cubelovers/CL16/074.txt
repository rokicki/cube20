Puzzletts in Seattle, USA also has them, I think for $32 each.

It's time I should write to Dr. Bandelow in Germany too; his company used
to be the primary distributor for these.

True, you've got all the necessary skills.  However, there is a pattern
that can occur on the 5x5x5 which needs a new algorithm which can be found
rather easily using the same old skills.

Now, Nob Yoshigahara told me that he has seen a working 6x6x6, and he
received a business card from the person who had manufactured the 6x6x6,
and he was playing with the business card and then lost the business card.
The maker was in Europe.  Anyone know who and where?
