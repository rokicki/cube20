Sounds like a 3-d analogue of the "15-puzzle". I have one which is called
"MagicJack", and is imported from Germany.  I bought mine at Games People
Play on Mass Ave. in Cambridge MA, USA (+1.617.492.0711). 

The cubies have varying numbers of sides colored silver, red, and green.
There are three different ways to "solve" it. The silver way is easiest; the
green way requires you to match up patterns on each facelet to make a
continuous loop, conceptually sinilar to Rubik's Tangle. The red solution
also requires a continuous loop, and there are symbols that must be matched
up too, making it harder to find a pattern that is valid. 

I haven't scrambled mine yet, because I haven't had time to write down 
the initial pattern.
