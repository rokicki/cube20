this is exactly what i tried to explain in my recent posts: the latter
statement follows from the former.  and yes, its length is indeed  10q.
it's pretty easy to find maneuvers which end in each quarter turn:

     (F'B') (UUDD) (FB) (RL)    =
     (U'D') (FFBB) (UD) (R'L')  =
     (R'L') (U'D') (FFBB) (UD)  =
     (R'L') (UD) (FFBB) (U'D')  =
     (RL) (F'B') (UUDD) (FB)    =
     (RL) (FB) (UUDD) (F'B').

it seems like jerry's terminology is more reasonable, so i'll stop
using mine.  jerry's figures

beg the obvious question:  what is that strong local maximum,
which is unique up to symmetry?
