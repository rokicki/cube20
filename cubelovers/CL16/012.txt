Mike is correct.

Try instead, (L2R2)(U2D2)(F'B')(U2D2)(L2R2)(F'B').

This is a very pretty pattern which may well have a name, but I
don't know what the name is.  Also, it is its own inverse.

Is the length 12h in <Q,H>?  Is it a local maximum (strong or otherwise)
in <Q,H>?   Is the length 20q in <Q>?  Is it a local maximum in <Q>?
