Subject:   3x3x3 Cubes for Sale

For the first time in years, I have seen 3x3x3 cubes for sale in a
store.  (For American readers, the store is Hills, which is a regional
chain which competes against WalMart and Kmart.  The price is $8.97 --
U.S. dollars.)  The box has a note signed by Erno Rubik, and gives
the proper size of the cube group.  Also, and I couldn't see inside
the box to verify this, the Face centers seemed to be marked in such
a way as to support the Supergroup.  Rubik's note about the size of
the  problem says it is 4^4 times bigger than the regular problem.
The manufacturer (or maybe distributor?) is Matchbox Toys (or is it
Matchbook Toys?).
