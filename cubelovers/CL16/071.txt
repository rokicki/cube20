Can't help with this...unless you're in Montreal, in which case you
might give Valet de Coeur a try.  I think that's where I got mine.

You're right; it won't.  If you can handle the 3-cube and 4-cube,
you've got all the necessary skills.  About the only further challenge
is the supergroup, where (for example) each face has a picture on it,
so that the inner face cubies have to be positioned (and oriented, for
the center cubie on an odd-sized cube) correctly.  I have never seen
such a thing for cubes larger than 3x3x3, but I also have never
bothered really looking for one.
