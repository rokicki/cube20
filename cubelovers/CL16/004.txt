Subject: M-conjugacy vs. C-Conjugacy in the Slice group

Jerry Bryan tried to communicate about this to cube-lovers, but
there's apparently a technical difficulty.

On 20 May, Jerry said:

I emailed him to note to the contrary that RL' and R'L are indeed
C-conjugates, for example under 180 degree rotation around the F-B
axis.  I did wonder, though, whether that meant that there could be
C-conjugate slice positions that were not M-conjugate.

He emailed me:

> In retrospect, I don't think the search program was necessary....

and continues with an argument that did not convince me, but the
following does:

First, consider the central inversion v, which maps each point of the
cube to its diametric opposite.  Conjugation by v maps each face-turn
(e.g. F) with its diametric opposite in opposite sense (B').  Since
these are the pairs that constitute a slice move, and they commute, we
have:

    v' FB' v = (v' F v)  (v' B' v) = B' F = F B',

and similarly for the other slice moves, showing that each slice move
is its own v-conjugate.  This extends to a proof that each position in
the slice group is its own v-conjugate:

    v' s1 s2 ... sn v = (v' s1 v) (v' s2 v) ... (v' sn v)
                      = s1 s2 ... sn.

Suppose that we have two M-conjugate positions X, Y in the slice
group.  So X = m' Y m for some m in M.  If m is in C, then X and Y are
C-conjugate and we are done.  Otherwise take the central inversion v;
we know that mv is in C.  We also know that

    X = v' X v = v' m' Y m v = (mv)' Y (mv).

So X and Y are C-conjugate in this case as well.  QED.

Note: "Being its own v-conjugate" might as well be called "being
v-symmetric".
