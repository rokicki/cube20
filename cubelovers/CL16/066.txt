Subject: Orange County Mensa?

Many of you are probably wondering why you are getting mail about a Mensa
meeting in Orange County.  It's because some pinheaded loser with only half
a brain thought it would be a good idea to add the entire Cube-Lovers
mailing list to the "PuzzleParty@cytex.com" mailing list.  I have sent a
vigorous complaint to the culprits and to their postmaster.
