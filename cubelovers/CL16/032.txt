In Feb at the NY international toy show the KOOSH people
told me that they had bought the marketing rights for
RUBIK items from Western Publishing (the Matchbox LABEL).
They had new packaging and were changing the items to
be sold (eg, they said they were going to sell Rubuik's
amgic).

So the items seen in Hills with Matchbox packaging is
old stock that will soon no longer be around.

THE FUTURE IS PUZZLING,
BUT CUBING IS FOREVER !!!
