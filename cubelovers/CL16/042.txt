Much is explained! (And this is all the way back in file "cube01" in
the archives, Date: 14 December 1980 1916-EST).

What does the 1916- mean in front of EST???

If we put the edges in place in Jerry's (and Dan's) position
then we have a position M-conjugate to the one I posted.
(re-posted below).

        F U U
        U U U
        D U L
R L B   R F B   D R R   B B D
L L L   F F F   R R R   B B B
U L L   F F U   L R F   L B F
        D D B
        D D D
        R D U

Great! We both concur that this pattern is in the swap orbit.
There is another position with M-class 4 in the twist orbit,
but that one is *utterly* impossible unless one corner twists
on it's own (perhaps due to desperate cube turning?)

There are 2 other types of position with M-class 4, and that is
pinwheels and pinwheels + pons asinorum.

(I must be cubing too much, 1916-EST has to be 7:16 pm Eastern
Standard Time).
