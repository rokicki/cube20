Uh, the 8 Dec 1993 22:41:38 note concerns the Superflip composed
with the 6-H.  The plain old 6-H was 8 Dec 1993 23:16:50.

The length of the Superflip composed with the 6-H in edges-without-
centers was 13.  The position is even, so the length must be
at least 14 in edges-with-centers.  My search of edges-with-centers
has not gotten that far yet.  Also, the length 13 Superflip 6-H
process for edges-without-centers induces an invisible rotation,
so it is not as pretty as the length 8 process for 6-H which does
not induce an invisible rotation.
