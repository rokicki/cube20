Last year I bought one in San Francisco in a shop located at the 
Trocadero Center (probably misspelled). However I can't really recall the
name of the shop (Game-something), but I did find shops with the same name in
Carmel and Santa Barbera.

Having seen mentioned this Ishi so many times I finally take the time to ask some
questions myself:

Does Ishi also sell puzzles by mail order overseas (i.e. in Europe,
especially in the Netherlands) or better: do they a distributor overhere ?
How can I contact them for a brochure ? Is this the same Ishi which sells
GO boards etc ? (I believe I have seen them on a Web-site somewhere).

I am also looking for other company's which sell good puzzles by mail order to the
Netherlands.
Does anyone have the address of Meffert in HongKong ?

Maybe it is good idea to make a list of company's, shops ordered by location etc,
since questions like the above pop up from time to time. I know I would be interested
in a such a list. It would be very useful when I am planning my holidays :).
