Subject: The Cube-Lovers Archives expands

Occasionally people have approached me and wondered if there was an FTP
archive of Cube-related material (programs, documents, databases, pictures,
whatever).  I have always replied that the only archive I knew of was the
archive of Cube-Lovers mail that I maintain.  Since this question keeps
coming up, there must be a need to be filled, so I propose to expand our
archives to cover any additional Cube-related material that people might
care to submit.

If you would like to submit a contribution to this archive, please send
mail to Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU (please do -not- send mail to all of
Cube-Lovers) and include:

  o  The location where I can pick up the files you wish to contribute
     (preferably using anonymous FTP).

  o  A brief description of your contribution, to be included in a master
     index file.

I reserve the right to redescribe, repackage, rename, recompress or totally
reject your contribution.

Periodically I will announce new additions to the archive to all of
Cube-Lovers.  Currently the archives contain nothing other than the
electronic mail archives.  (Although I know of at least one potential
contributor who's been waiting in the wings for a couple of months now...)

Some of you will no doubt have forgotten where the archive is: 

Using FTP, connect to FTP.AI.MIT.EDU, login as "anonymous" (any password),
and go to the directory "pub/cube-lovers".  (From the World Wide Web, you
can use the URL: "ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/cube-lovers".)
