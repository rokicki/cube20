Subject: Second Announcement

OK, I think I've cleaned up Cube-Lovers enough that it's safe for anyone to
use it.  (For some of you this message is the first indication that
Cube-Lovers is back -- many copies of my first announcement bounced back to
me.)

Those of you who keep asking for the archives will be pleased to know that
they are again available for anonymous FTP: Connect to AI.MIT.EDU, login as
"anonymous" (any password), and in the directory "/pub/alan" you will find
the seven (compressed) files "cube-mail-0.Z" through "cube-mail-6.Z".
Archive vital statistics:

	   File		  From		   To	     Size (bytes)
	   ----		  ----		   --	     ------------
	cube-mail-0	12 Jul 80	23 Oct 80	185037
	cube-mail-1	 3 Nov 80	 9 Jan 81	135719
	cube-mail-2	10 Jan 81	 3 Aug 81	138566
	cube-mail-3	 3 Aug 81	 3 May 82	137753
	cube-mail-4	 4 May 81	11 Dec 82	139660
	cube-mail-5	11 Dec 82	 6 Jan 87	173364
	cube-mail-6	10 Jan 87	13 Apr 90	216733

(Unfortunately, due to the way mail works here at the AI Lab, it is not
possible to have the current active archive accumulate anywhere where
anonymous FTP can pick it up.)

As you can see, things really slacked off after 1982, and we were really
quiet during the middle of the decade.

For those of you who missed my first message, let me repeat that our
"official" addresses remain Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for submissions and
Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.
