Subject: Patterns on the order 5 cube

	OK, for everybody out there with the 5-cube, this is the most difficult
pattern I have come up with to implement (which is still highly ordered).

Where this pattern is also present on the remaining 3 sides.  (This amounts
to twirling a 4-cube, a 3-cube, a 2-cube and a 1-cube around a pair of
diagonally opposite corners in alternating directions.  It's not difficult
to do after you've done it a couple of times, but the potential for getting
confused is surprising.
