Subject:  hello there

Hello there,

This is my first posting to the cube-lovers board, so I'm
probably gonna ask a couple of really obvious questions:

a) Does anyone know where I can get a copy of David Singmaster's
   book "Notes on Rubik's magic cube?"  This was THE definitive book
   on the cube about 8 years ago, but I lost my copy....does anyone
    know if it's still in print?? ( Oh yeah, maybe I should mention
   that I'm in England...David Singmaster was a lecturer at one of
   the colleges in London I think - was this book EVER published in
   the states? )

b) ( This is a real obvious one... )   Does anyone have any tips or
   advice on solving the 4*4*4 cube that appeared a few years after
   the original 3*3*3 one.  I got really close to getting it right
   a couple of years ago, but never quite made it.

Thanks in advance for any help,
  Rod Chapman
