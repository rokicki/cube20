   Hello there,

   This is my first posting to the cube-lovers board, so I'm
   probably gonna ask a couple of really obvious questions:

   a) Does anyone know where I can get a copy of David Singmaster's
      book "Notes on Rubik's magic cube?"  This was THE definitive book
      on the cube about 8 years ago, but I lost my copy....does anyone
       know if it's still in print?? ( Oh yeah, maybe I should mention
      that I'm in England...David Singmaster was a lecturer at one of
      the colleges in London I think - was this book EVER published in
      the states? )

   b) ( This is a real obvious one... )   Does anyone have any tips or
      advice on solving the 4*4*4 cube that appeared a few years after
      the original 3*3*3 one.  I got really close to getting it right
      a couple of years ago, but never quite made it.

I have not looked at it for several years but if memory serves you need
only one extra transformation which is not applicable to the 3^3. It is
the single edge flip. I no longer recall it explicitly but it was kinda
trivial to find.
