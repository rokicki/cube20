Subject: Is Meffert still around?

	I am wondering if Meffert is still around, with his club to purchase
new and interesting Cube products.  If he is, would somebody please send me
his address and what the current membership fee is.  Also a price list.

	If he is not, would people be interested in restarting such a club?
I have a hard time believing that there aren't enough people for a cube-of-
the-month club (or perhaps cube-of-the-quarter) as these things are not that
complex (ie., expensive) to produce.  We might even be able to do runs in
rolled aluminum instead of plastic.
