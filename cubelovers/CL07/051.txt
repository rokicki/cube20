#$%@!! 

I just realize that I answered the wrong question!  My answer was to the
question:

    "My cube is completely solved *except* that the 2 pieces marked `O' are
     flipped."

(Sorry.)  The right answer should be:

The state of the cube is not:

X|O|X|X|X                  X|A|X|C|X
X|X|X|X|X                  X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X     But rather:  X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X                  X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|O|X                  X|X|X|B|X

Where cubie "C" just "looks" like it's in the right place.

You need an operator that rotates  A->B->C->A.  (Left as an exercise; hints
available on request.)

This will very likely leave an inconvenient number of edges flipped.  For
the answer to _this_ problem, see my last post.  ;)
