Hi.

I think we're in complete agreement, at least up to here.  (I particularly
enjoyed your "proof by hardware ;).

I didn't mean to imply that the A->B->C->A operator preserved flipped-ness
of the Non-Central-Edge[NCE] Cubies.  Moreover, I was being imprecise
where I said "a NCE cubie is simply flipped"; rather "the cubie *appears*
as if it were in the right place (i.e. judged by its colors) and flipped".
As you point out, *really* means that it is in the slot of its "twin".

To recap more succinctly, what I was proposing was a rather pedestrian,
two-step solution to the original problem.  Starting from the initial
state in FIG1 (where the cube is completely "solved" except that the
cubies marked "O" are swapped.  Also they are swapped in such a way that
the visible face is all a single color).

FIG1: X|O|X|X|X                      FIG2: X|Q|X|Q|X
      X|X|X|X|X                  	   X|X|X|X|X
      X|X|X|X|X     A->B->C->A gives:      X|X|X|X|X
      X|X|X|X|X                  	   X|X|X|X|X
      X|X|X|O|X                  	   X|X|X|X|X

STEP1] If we then apply the A->B->C->A operator, we end up with the state
in FIG2, where the cube is completely "solved" except that the cubies
marked "Q" "appear" to be "simply" flipped.

STEP2] We can then solve this problem, which (imo) is easier.  For example
see the method that I described in an earlier post; this involves turning
the non-central plane (containing the flipped cubie) through a quarter turn.

Of course, now that I say it, it seems that the correct course would be to
*start* with the quarter turn of the non-central plane.  This would leave
five NCE cubies out of place, but the cube would be in the right orbit.
