map locator -->  MCCC is near the intersection of US #1 and I-295.

Here's how to get to a parking space at TCF!

Guaranteed parking is available at Mercer County Park, which surrounds
the MCCC campus on three sides.  MCP has two entrances, one on Rt 535
(Edinburg Rd. or Old Trenton Rd., depending on whether you're north or
south of MCCC) and one on Hughes Drive.  My advice is to turn off at a
park entrance.  HOWEVER, if you're early (on sat this means before 7
on sun before 9) or if you're daring, continue past the park entrance
to the College entrance.  If you're lucky, the gendarmes will let you
on campus to look for a parking space.  IF THEY REFUSE YOU ACCESS,
continue to the traffic light and turn (either LEFT onto Old Trenton
Rd. or RIGHT onto Hughes Drive.) and proceed to the  Park entrance.

FROM THE NORTH:

1) VIA U.S. 1: Go south on US 1 and take the Rt 533 South
(Quakerbridge
Rd.) overpass.  After about two miles, turn left onto Hughes Dr.  The
Park entrance will be on your left in about a mile, with the College
entrance about 0.5 miles further.

2) VIA N.J. TURNPIKE: Go south to Exit 8 (Hightstown) and get on Rt 33
WEST.  In downtown Hightstown, turn right onto Rt 571 and follow.
 Near
GE Astro, turn left onto Rt 535.  The Park entrance is about 4 miles
down
the road, with the College entrance about a mile further.

FROM THE SOUTH:

1) VIA U.S. 1: Go north on Rt. 1 and turn right onto Rt 546 (at Mrs.
G's
Appliances).  Just after the overpass, turn right onto Youngs Rd.
 Follow
to the end and turn right onto Hughes Drive.  The Park entrance is
about
a mile away.

2) VIA I-95: I-95 NORTH becomes I-295 SOUTH (don't ask!).  Take Exit
65A,
Sloan Rd and follow to the end (Sloan Rd. becomes Flock Rd. at the
light -
also don't ask!!).  Go left onto Old Trenton Rd.  The Campus entrance
is
by a jughandle turn, about a mile up Old Trenton Rd.  The Park
entrance
is on the left about a mile further up.

3) VIA I-295: Follow I-295 NORTH to its temporary end at Rt 130, and
go
north to Rt. 206 where you will follow signs to TRENTON and then to

I-295 NORTH. Take Exit 65A to Sloan Ave. and follow it to the end.  Go
left
on Old Trenton Rd.  The campus entrance is by a jughandle turn, about
a mile up Old Trenton Rd.  The Park entrance is on the left about a
mile further.

4) VIA N.J. TURNPIKE:  Take Exit 7A to I-195 WEST.  Take the first
exit,
5B to Rt 130 NORTH.  Left at the first light onto Rt. 526  Bear left
and take an immediate right, still on Rt 526.  At end, turn left onto
Rt 535, Old Trenton Rd.  The Park entrance is a bout a mile away; the

College, another mile.
