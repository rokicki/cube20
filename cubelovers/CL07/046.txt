On the other hand, a 5X (or any cube of odd order) will still have the
constraints imposed by a fixed center.  As a single example, the 4X here in
my office is completely "solved" except that two opposite corners are
swapped.  That's not something that can happen on a cube of odd order (at
least I don't think so, but I would love to be proved wrong ;).
