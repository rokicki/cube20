Subject: Re: New from Rubik

	Well I have the Rubik's XV and Rubik's pyramid.  The XV is a pretty
good puzzle (ie., I haven't solved it yet after trying for an hour or so).
The pyramid is essentially a Pyraminx.  The only complication beyond the
Pyraminx that the Pyramid offers is that the vertex tetrahedrons can be
rotated such that a useless color shows and a necessary color is hidden.

	The solution becomes trivial once you have solved the Pyraminx.  This
seems like a good place to save your money.
