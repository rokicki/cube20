Subject:  Re:  rec & ed computing

Sure....

  -  REC is VERY slanted toward high school students, and so there is
     very little advanced or profound stuff in there.
  -  While there is a nod to other worlds, primarily it is all in BASIC,
     and generally focused on the IBM PC.
  -  There is a fascination with mindless crunching just to print out
     numbers that I can't fathom.  A good portion of the articles
     center on a numbers with some odd property or another, or finding
     the actual _numeric_ solution to something and usually brute force
     [or close to it].  The graphics hacks, such as they are, are
     primarily crunching-based [moire patterns and such].

No real discussion of 'puzzles', for example, nor of the kinds of techniques
and such you need to partially-tame one of those awful [but real world]
exponential searches, nor of representing 3D objects or manipulations of them,
or search strategies, no word problems, etc.
