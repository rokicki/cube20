Subject: New "CUBE"

I found a fun new cube, sorta.

It is called Square 1.

it rotates in WIERD ways.

it is a challenge to return to the state of being a cube, much less to
solve it.

My friend calls it "unfriendly."

the way it is set up, it is a cube, with a center band that has one
split.  the two faces on either side of it that are split into the
normal three on a side, but the pieces meet at the center, i.e.: the
side ones are wedges, and the corners are almost-squares with the point
not on the outside being the center.

it is fun.

I was told it will be out at christmas, but I bought it in a store
called Games Unlimited in Squirrel Hill, a neighborhood of Pittsburgh. 
Buy one from someone, and fry your brain.

Enjoy.

Dale
