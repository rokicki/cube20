Subject: rubik's magic alternate coloring

The version your student has is the one where the object is to fold it
into a cube (I have it, with the instructions. Yes, it does have the
same structure as the original 2x4 one---you can fold that one
into a cube (with two "flaps") too. The object is to fold it
into a cube where the colors of the three faces meeting at each corner
always match.
