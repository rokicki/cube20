(First: personal to Ronnie: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK
YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
I've been looking for a 5by for _years_.)

I just called.  First, the cubes are at Games GALLERY (boy, you guys on the
west coast sure have friendly, helpful phone operators.  Also store owners:
when I called the nearest GamesKeeper that the operator could find, the
manager there gave the number for Games Gallery!).  $27.95.  They got them
from Dr Christopher <somethingortheother> in Germany.

And, yes, they have a couple left after taking my phone order.  ;)

BTW, Graham (the guy that I talked to at GG --is _everybody_ this friendly
out there?) said they had about a half-dozen new Rubik's toys (i.e. "new" =
post Rubik's Clock).  Including something called "Rubik's 15", which Graham
(note how we're on a first-name basis now) described as "like the old 15-
puzzle, but *NASTY*!"

Does anybody know any of these?
