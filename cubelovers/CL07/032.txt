SHORT ANSWER:  Meffert's puzzle club is dead!

MORE:  Meffert is alive and is trying to get back into the puzzle
 business - if you want specific information Jerry Slocum, beverly
hills has been in conatct with him.

PUZZLE CLUBS, ETC.:  
1 - the economics of a puzzle club is that well made  puzzles (both
from a design and engineering perspective) cost $20 and up.
2 - people interested in being current on whats happening in puzzles
should subscribe to CFF, Puzzletopia and possible ARM (all have been
discussed before)


I have been busy but CFF#25 (silver aniverssary; cost $18) is 5
volumes plus vendor catalogs (bandelow, constatin) and encompassses
the last 10 tears of puzzling around the world.
