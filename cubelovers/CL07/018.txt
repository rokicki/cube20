Subject:      Rubik's Cube Variants?
To: cube-lovers@life.ai.mit.edu

  Does anyone know where I can find all those variations on the Rubik's
theme that popped up after the Cube came out? I mean puzzles like the
Pyraminx, Impossiball, etc. I haven't seen any place that sells them
in the area where I live, New york state.
  I would even be willing to send for them from overseas if the price
is reasonable.
