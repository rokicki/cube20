That's right.  Cube-Lovers has returned from the dead.  Due to various
hardware, software and personal crises, Cube-Lovers has been down since
sometime last spring.  I'm sure that many of you didn't even notice, given
what a low-volume list this has become.

Our "official" addresses remain Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for submissions
and Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.  (Actually, you
will find that using simply "...@AI.MIT.EDU" will work just as well.)

Since this is the first message to this list after moving it to a new
machine with a different mailer, I expect that many addresses on the list
have ceased to function.  If I were you, I wouldn't send any mail here for
about a week -- just to give me a chance to process all the bounces I'm
about to get.

The archives are currently unavailable, but I hope to have them available
for FTP soon.
