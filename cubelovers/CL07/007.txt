Subject: Archives again

I hate to bother you folks again so soon, but naturally the AI Lab chose
today to reorganize how anonymous FTP access worked.  Here are the updated
instructions for accessing the Cube-Lovers archives:

Connect to TRIX.AI.MIT.EDU, login as "anonymous" (any password), and in the
directory "pub/cube-lovers" you will find the seven (compressed) files
"cube-mail-0.Z" through "cube-mail-6.Z".  

Archive vital statistics (when uncompressed):

	   File		   From		   To	     Size (bytes)
	   ----		   ----		   --	     ------------
	cube-mail-0	12 Jul 80	23 Oct 80	185037
	cube-mail-1	 3 Nov 80	 9 Jan 81	135719
	cube-mail-2	10 Jan 81	 3 Aug 81	138566
	cube-mail-3	 3 Aug 81	 3 May 82	137753
	cube-mail-4	 4 May 81	11 Dec 82	139660
	cube-mail-5	11 Dec 82	 6 Jan 87	173364
	cube-mail-6	10 Jan 87	13 Apr 90	216733

(Unfortunately, due to the way mail works here at the AI Lab, it is not
possible to have the current active archive accumulate anywhere where
anonymous FTP can pick it up.)
