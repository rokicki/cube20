Newspaper Decries Rubik's Cube Craze
    PEKING (AP) - Rubik's Cube, the colorful brain-teaser that has
started to captivate the Chinese, is being criticized by a Peking
newspaper as a dangerous pastime that can lead to divorce, abnormal
behavior, high blood pressure and aching fingers.
    ''The Magic Cube possibly is beneficial to sharpening intelligence,
but don't forget that its side effects might bring danger,'' the
Peking Evening News said, using the puzzle's Chinese name.
    Last November, the Chinese press reported people were standing in
line to buy the cube in Shanghai, and that city already had held its
first Magic Cube contest although the toy hit the market only a few
months earlier.
