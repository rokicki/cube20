Subject: Re: Masquerade

Masquerade is still on my stack, but actually I've come across another
amusement which has been taking up my time during the last couple of
weeks.  Does anybody know about the St. Valentine's Day Massacre?
It is a cross-country road rally which takes place on paper--the Rand McNally
road atlas to be precise.  You are given hundreds of very detailed and
tricky instructions and puzzles as you make your way from the Golden Gate
Bridge to the Statue of Liberty.  You must answer questions along the
way about what you see, time and distance between various points, etc.
I've found the whole thing to be a lot of fun and quite challenging, even
though the entry fee was $24.00 (includes a copy of the Road Atlas).
Trophies will be given out in 3 different classes of competition (Class C=
first timers, Class B= previous participants, Class A= Previous trophy
winners).

If anybody is interested, I'll be happy to provide more info--deadline for
entry is Feb. 14, answers must be sent in by March 1.

Also, I'd like to hear from anybody already involved if they'd like to
compare notes, etc.

Clive
P.S.  Alan--go ahead and forward to Cube-Lovers if you wish.
