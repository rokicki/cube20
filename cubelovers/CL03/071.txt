   One of my favorite pretty patterns on the Sphere is the "universe", from
"Unscrambling the cubE": every edge and corner flipped/twisted in place; the
each adjacent pair of corners twisted towards each other.  Forms a nice, 
symmetric pattern of each face "exploded" outward from its center, which
is more visible on the sphere than the cube.
