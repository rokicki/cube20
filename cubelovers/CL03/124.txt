The 4x4x4 has been confirmed by two stores in the Boston area
(Games People Play [Harvard Square] and The Name of the Game
[Quincy Market]).  Unfortunately Ideal is only taking orders now;
delivery is not expected until the fall (****sigh****).  I have
heard nothing of the 5x5x5. 

ALAN thinks we should solve the beast before we actually get one.
This could done in our heads, on paper, by machine assistance, or
by machine.  I have thought about it a little, and I think I have
all the necessary tools to do it.  It is not as easy as saying,
"Well if we just consider these two planes as one, it looks like
the 3x3x3, and..."  That doesn't work for the majority (the
hardest parts) of the puzzle, for reasons I'll be happy to
explain.

Before people start asking a lot of questions about the
properties of the 4x4x4, they should look in
	MC:ALAN;CUBE 4X4X4
which contains the parts of the archives that discuss the 4x4x4.

If there is any interest I can try and create a discussion...
