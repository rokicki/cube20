Folks,

You may love your cubes, but don't kiss them or lick your fingers
after having twisted them! According to a recent article in one
of the big papers here, the colotrtabs contain exceptionally high
levels of lead. The worst is the yellow face, closely followed by
the green, orange, red and blue. You have been warned.
