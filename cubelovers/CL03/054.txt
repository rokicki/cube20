Okay, then, how about: Cubists do it...

	... with both hands.
	... in groups.
	... symmetrically (!).
	... first on top, then on the bottom.
	... by swapping.
	... with their fingers.
	... while twisting their faces.
	... rectilinearly.
	... by conjugation (tautologous?).
	... despite odd orientations.
