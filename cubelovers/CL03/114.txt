  The folding puzzle book (I can look up the name and reference at home if
anyone is interested) is original, and a "cute" idea, but not very difficult
to solve.  It is a pleasant pastime, and good to do with older children, I
found.  It seems to be solved almost purely by trial and error.  I think with
some work, a truly interesting and difficult puzzle could be made using
the idea of paper folding to make patterns.
