To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC
Does Ideal Toy Corp. make those tiny cubes? (about a inch square)
Beware of stuff made in Tiawan as they break QUICKLY..as what
happened to me with a 3/4 inch cube..and I heard from my friend
that his tiawan-made cube (standard size 2 1/2 inch) broke
in a few days....
The only RUbic cube is the Ideal Toy corp cube and it's great!
