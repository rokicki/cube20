We were beaten by a dog. According to an article on Page 2 of the
Sunday Globe (3/14/82) the Golden Hare was found "by a man whose
dog accidentally stumbled across it"...  "The hare was buried just
beneath the surface in the shadow of an ancient cross at Ampthill
which commemorates Catherine of Aragon..". One of the major clues
in the book pointed to her.
