Subject: cubes at spielmessen in Essen

There will soon be a big gathering for games in Germany - Essen a so-called 
Spielmessen.

I am attending this gathering for the first time in three years so I am
looking for companies who will came to the spielmessen and who sells cubes.

The places is big so it would be nice for me to have same names to look for.

and hopefully I will have a real 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cube to play with in a few weeks :-)

/Martin
