I agree. I have all the different Magics and the OddzOn version is
not an improvement. The weird thing is that their website
www.rubiks.com
shows a picture of the Magic thats looks like one of the Matchbox
ones (BTW on the same site I read the other day that OddzOn is
planning to make their own deluxe cube).

Anyway, in the message that Wayne responded to, I was not
talking about Magic, but the "Magic Strategy Game" by Matchbox
which is a completely different thing. As I wrote, this has been re-
launched by OddzOn under the new name "Eclipse", and in this
case the OddzOn guys have actually improved the original design,
in my opinion.
