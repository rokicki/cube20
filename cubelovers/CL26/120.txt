Corrected: Rubik Cube Whiz Offers Millennium Bug Solution

LONDON (Reuters) - A man who solved the riddle of Rubik's cube has
invented a test kit to detect where the millennium computer bug will
strike.

At the age of 12, Patrick Bossert shot to fame when he worked out his
own solution to the mystifying cube and wrote a bestseller about it
that sold 1.5 million copies.

Now 30, he and a team of software experts at London-based WSP Business
Technology have developed Delta-T Probe, a program that can work out
whether microchips embedded in electronic equipment are likely to fail
on January 1, 2000.

Delta-T works by electronically detecting equipment to identify chips
that process date and time, making it likely to malfunction when 1999
becomes 2000.

``Only a small percentage of systems will fail to recognize the next
millennium, but finding out which ones might go wrong is a huge and
costly process,'' said Bossert, technical director at WSP Business
Technology, a unit of consulting engineering group WSP Group Plc.

Bossert estimates hundreds of millions of chips are buried deep inside
equipment in Britain. The chips control devices such as security
systems, fire alarms, production lines, medical equipment and
telecommunications.

Bossert expects one in 500 embedded systems will take equipment back
in time to Jan. 1, 1900, causing equipment to fail.

British supermarket chain Sainsbury's Plc is among major companies
that have tested Delta-T. Sainsbury's said a trial run at one of its
stores in Devon, southwestern England, had been a success.
