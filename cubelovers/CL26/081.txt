According to the reports on the patent case brought against Ideal for
infringement  of the Nichols patent (Moleculon Research Corp v. CBS,
Inc) there were two Ideal 2x2x2 cubes, both sold as the Rubik's Pocket
Cube, but one from Taiwan and one from Japan.  The Japanese version
used an internal sphere, which could well be the version with the
Philips screw referred to by Charlie Dickman, since it sounds like the
inside of a 4x4x4.  The Taiwanese version is less clearly described -
the internal faces are said to form a tongue and groove mechanism -
but probably also had an internal spider like the conventional 3x3x3 -
is this Nicholas Bodley's version?

Incidentally, by the time the case had been up and down to the Appeals
court a couple of times, the final decision, in 1989, was that just
these two forms infringed the patent.  The 3x3x3 and 4x4x4 were held
not to infringe.
