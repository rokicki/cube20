Ideal once made a deluxe Cube that had individual colored plastic tiles
attached to the cubies. It also had a mechanism (same general principle,
just different details) that would self-align as you began a maneuver
with a slight misalignment, instead of jamming. In other words, it was a
good bit more tolerant of misalignment. It would be delightful if they'd
reissue it!

It was maybe almost twice the price of the standard Cube, iirc.
Swapping stickers is silly! Learn how to disassemble (but reassemble as
a solved Cube; iirc, there are 11 wrong ways to do it, essentially).

Most of the movable-piece puzzles can be disassembled, but not all.
