Subject: Re: Oddzon version of the cube

Patrick,

As a long time cubist, I can assure you that at one time Ideal did make a
cube called "Rubik's Cube Deluxe".  They used tiles instead of stickers.
They were colored appropriately.  In fact, that is still the cube
that I use almost all of the time.  The tiles are colored with blue on
one side opposite of white, red opposite of orange, and yellow opposite of
green.  On the center red tile, was written in Gold Lettering "Rubik's
Cube Deluxe".  This placement of the Rubik's Cube logo differs from the
Ideal sticker version, where that version has the logo on a sticker on top
of the white center cube.  The gold lettering has faded over the past 17
years, but the cube is like new other than that.  If I remember correctly
this was a limited release by Ideal.  If you can find another one out there
that someone is willing to sell to you, I recommend getting it.

Sincerely,

Kevin Young
