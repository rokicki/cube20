Subject: Puzzlets

On 3/16/99 hart@iserver.com (Paul Hart) asked if Puzzlets is still in
business.  I can verify that they are in fact still in business in the
Supermall in Auburn, Washington (near Seattle).  They recently moved from a
location in downtown Seattle which may be the source of the confusion.

I can't say anything one way or the other about their tendency to not answer
Emails, but I have spoken to the owner recently about various cube-like
puzzles and he was very knowledgeable and willing to talk to me at length
(unfortunatley I don't remember his name).  I'm surprised he isn't a part of
this Email group!

I can also tell you that he DOES still maintain a list of people who would be
interested in paying to get somebody to do another run of 4x4x4 cubes (aka
"Rubik's Revenge").  Apparently no manufacturer will do it unless they can do
a run of 30,000 of them!  Also, I know he has a list of people who would be
willing to pay a premium for a used version of the 4x4x4, if anyone's
interested.  I traded my 4x4x4 with him for some other merchandise since I
find the 5x5x5, which I only just learned existed about two months ago, to be
basically the same degree of difficulty as the 4x4x4, just bigger.  They do
have some 5x5x5's in stock.
