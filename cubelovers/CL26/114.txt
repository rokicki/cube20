Subject: Re: Moves for Solving the Pyramorphix puzzle

Hey!  Everyone on this list _already_ knows moves to solve
Pyramorphix, although it often requires careful staring at the
thing in order to recognize the exact configuration each time.

You see, everyone on this list knows how to solve 3x3x3
Rubik's cube.  And everyone knows how to solve 2x2x2
Rubik's cube because it's a subset of the 3x3x3, without
edges or centers.  And everyone knows how to solve
Pyramorphix because it's a subset of the 2x2x2, where
some of the corners don't need orienting.
