I feel like I was born in the wrong era.  I'm 20 years old and in
college right now.  If I had been born 10-15 years earlier, I might be
training to be in competitions.  I was a little too young when it was in
its prime in the 80's.  I got my hands on a cube this past November &
now am hooked for life.  I went from 30 mins to 3 mins in the 1st month,
& in 2 more months got it down to under a minute.  I bring a cube
everywhere I go.  Tons of people come up to to talk to me about it.  99%
of the time they would say:  "You know what I used to do?" and then
either: 1) peel off the stickers or 2) take it apart.  I used to laugh
along at this amusing anecdote, for I myself admit to both.  But, after
the 100th person...Its just annoying.

There is no one I can share my hobby with.  Of all these people, in the
4 months I've been into this, I have only met one person who actually
knew how, but it was years ago, and has since lost interest.  I got one
of my friends into it, but he isn't at a level where he can compete w/
me yet.  Plus, he's too busy to put some serious time into it.  With the
exception of my one friend, I feel all alone when it comes to cubes.

Right now I am looking for any cube enthusiasts, beginner through
advanced, in my area who want to get together to compete, buy/sell/trade
books & cube related stuff, share secrets/techniques that can only be
taught in person (there are limits as to what text & 2D images on a web
page & in books can convey about manipulating a 3D cube), etc.

All of my knowledge on cubes is from people's web pages, but practically
all of them are made to teach the beginner.  My current goal is a 30
second average.  At a 55 sec average w/ a 33 sec record, I'm not too far
from my goal.  I achieved this using moves I've gotten from the web.  I
would like to talk to people personally, and see some of the books no
longer in print.  I read somewhere that there are over a hundred
written.  Please contact me if you have books I can look at, or know
where I can get a hold of them.

I would like also to join any local clubs if any still exist or, If
there are enough people interested, start a new one.  A lot of people
who have seen me playing with mine in public have asked me if the
Rubik's Cube has "come back" like a new craze.  Although there isn't, I
would sure like to see one.  And how about a new championship?  That
would be cool.  Not a world wide thing, but it wouldn't be hard to set
up a small local one with a small prize like a Megaminx.  Any thoughts
on this?  Has this been attempted lately?

I live in Carson, California.  So, if anyone in the LA/South Bay area is
interested, please contact me.
