 Charlie, I'm just about dead sure my 2^3s (from about 15 (?) years go)
have no screws. I studied your description, and it seems that the
mechanism has been redesigned! I described the mechanism of mine in
considerable (if not painful!) detail, maybe a year and a half ago; it's
probably in the archives. The keyword "jack" should help to locate the
post.

 Perhaps a continuing market combined with the difficulty of assembling
the original design created a need for a new one.

 Would really *love* to know whether there is a newer and different
mechanism. As a somewhat casual student of these mechanisms, I've come
to realize that for all "sizes", more than one mechanism is possible.

 I have great admiration for the designers who create these marvelous
mechanisms. I love the 5^3 as much for its innards (which I regard as
thoroughly astonishing) as for its essential function.

 I also admire the mathematicians, programmers, and practical users of
group theory on this List; I have only a faint awareness of what they're
talking about, but their amazing posts keep my mind properly stretched.
I feel a bit like a dog listening to his human family discussing, say, a
trip to Australia (the dog didn't go). However, that's perfectly OK with
me! My mind is quite good, and to some degree it's circumstance that I'm
not "with it".

My regards to all,
