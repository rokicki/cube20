I think you are right to say that the indexing of a cube group reduced
by symmetries does not behave very well. For this reason I must build a
table which maps the index to a representative of the corresponding
equivalence class. I have no method to directly compute the index.

About 10 million entries would be possible but quite a lot, so I
defined two edge permutations x and y as "equivalent" if x = MyN with
two symmetries M and N. So I reduced by another factor of about 48 and
got 208816 classes. If x is a representative of such a class with index i,
Mx with an arbitrary symmetry M is a representative of a "real" symmetry
class. The "well behaved" index of the latter is computed by 48*i +
Index(M), where index(M) enumerates the symmetries from 0 to 47.
The problem with that which I did not realize first is, that Mx and M'x
could be equivalent, which led to wrong results when computing the God's
Algorithm for positions more than 3 face turns from start (I compared my
results with Jerry's, who made a quick run for positions up to 6 face
turns). With some exta computation this problem could be fixed.
