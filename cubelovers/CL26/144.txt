Switching stickers is a no-no. You can so this a couple of times, after
that they'll just fall off...

I've seen cubes that have real plastic colors! They are 3by's in black,
with colored square bricks on the faces that form the colors. They
are about $5 (I think). I haven't bought one to check quality (yet?).
Perhaps if the mechanism is alright, these might be better suited for
the cube-addict. But I'm afraid that the mechanism won't be able to stand
lots of use.

Perhaps I'll just go ahead and try the experiment. After all, it's only
$5...
