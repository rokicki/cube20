I think I have mentioned on this list before that I bought one in India
in 1996.

>Is that process so much more expensive,

I think it is not.  I am not an expert on manufacturing so can't really
say if it's more expensive to make a multicolored plastic piece than
it is to make (or buy) adhesive tapes and punch stickers out of them
for attachment to unicolored pieces.  But I do think, when the version
with multicolored plastic pieces could be retailed for 35 rupees, the
cost of manufacture must be less than 35 rupees, the difference between
this method of manufacture and the more common method must be less than
35 rupees, and I'd lay odds on a distributor not even noticing the
difference in costs if they went that way.

(35 rupees was about 120 yen then.  35 rupees would be about 100
yen now, though the product's price in rupees might have risen.)

Interesting.
Is this the reason why the stickers come off by themselves :-)
Maybe they don't know that some people used to disassemble cubes and
rearrange the cubies :-)  Of course early Rubik's Revenges used to
disassemble themselves that way.
