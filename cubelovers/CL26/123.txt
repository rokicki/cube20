This may be common knowledge to many of you on this list, but I thought
I'd mention these and give everyone a fair shot (as well as maybe
angering some who used it as a resource to locate some harder to find
pieces).

1) If you are looking for some rare pieces like the Revenge, Megaminx,
Alexander's Star, these items often come up for auction at

http://www.ebay.com

In the three weeks or so that I've been actively participating in
auctions, I've seen several of each of the following: Rubik's Revenge,
Alexander's Star, Missing Link, Megaminx, and Whippit.  I've also seen
Skewb, 5x5x5, Rubik's Magic, Pyraminx, Mickey's Challenge, and any
number of others come up for bidding.  Haven't seen a Rubik's Domino
(2x3x3), though.  For a general idea of what's there, try doing a search
for the key word "rubik" at the site.  That's just for starters.  I even
saw a Cuboctahedron (yes, just a shaved down 3x3x3 cube) go for over 60
dollars.  Incredible.  Using eBay I have personally added two more
Revenges to my collection.



2) There is also someone on the net who seems to be contacting people
directly and trying to sell a stock of puzzles he ran across.  His
email is jo_schumacher@[see moderator's note].  Try emailing him for
availability and pricing.  For example, he was last selling mint
Revenges for $109 and Alexander's Stars for $70.  I haven't bought
anything from him yet so consider it an "at your own risk" venture.

[ Moderator's note: At least one person on the list has complained
  about getting spam from schumacher, and it sure looked like spam to
  me.  I certainly can't countenance sending e-mail to offer goods for
  sale to list members who haven't indicated a willingness to receive
  such an offer.  When it comes to spammers, "at your own risk"
  includes "at the risk of helping to make this medium unusable.

  I usually steer the numerous requests from people seeking Rubik's
  Revenge to ebay (and to yard sales, and to simulations).  But note
  that the FTC says that internet auctions are the growth zone for
  Internet fraud.  This can be somewhat mitigated by sending your
  money through an escrow agent--see ebay for information on that. ]
