I have seen one or both of these puzzles, and they were very different
from each other.  The cylinder, or prism, was actually the first cube
I learned to solve, when my cousin from Luxembourg visited back in
1981. I have pleasant memories of it, because it was very well made
and pleasing to view. It is harder to solve than the cube since the
four of the edges are "cut", so it is impossible to match edges to
centers - leaving the possibility of having to backtrack later and
figure out which "corner" (and matching edge) is in the wrong place!
But I had it down and could quickly readjust (usually had to swap
corners diagonally in the top two layers if I found a single flipped
edge left in the bottom layer when almost done solving it, if I
remember).
I liked it so much, I requested and obtained 4 more after my cousin
returned to Europe! I would take them to school, one at a time, until
(unfortunately) they all eventually disappeared. At least two were
stolen out of my (locked) locker on different occasions.  Someone else
liked them, too.
Anyway, I never found that puzzle in the US, and could only get it
from my cousin in Europe. (Who I think may have gotten them from
England).
But the other puzzle, as described by the moderator, was available in
the US back then, I think in the following year or so after my cousin
visited, since one of my friends had one. But it wasn't as nice
looking or well made.  So I didn't care for it. It was more like the
cube with its corners cut, forming rectangles and triangles in a
spherical symmetry, as opposed to the prism from Europe which has four
of its 3-piece-edges cut, forming only rectangles and having a
cylindrical symmetry.
