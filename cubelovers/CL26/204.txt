Since I was the first to suggest this method, I'll retract the advice.
Indeed, it would be really unfortunate to strip the threads in the
plastic that hold a screw in place.

Mr. Meffert is, and has been, a formidable inventor and manufacturer of
cube-like puzzles for quite some time, for those who don't recognize his
name. I'd follow his advice; definitely! Do note that he said "loosen",
not "remove" the screw. I posted recently about special care in
reinserting a removed screw.

My regards to all...
