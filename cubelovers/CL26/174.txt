Noel Dillabough [noel@mud.ca] didn't write, but his message contained:

Nob Yoshigahara told me that he had designed a correction for the original
design of the 4^3 cubes so that they would not fall apart.

In my experience, early 4^3s easily fell apart, and then when a cubie hit the
floor it easily broke.  In my experience, later 4^3s don't easily fall apart.
I would guess that the manufacturer accepted Nob-sensei's advice.
