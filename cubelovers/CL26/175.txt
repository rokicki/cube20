Subject: Easy to find tile cubes
Date: Mon, 15 Mar 1999 21:38:27 -0500

I live in Colombia South America and here it is very easy to find cubes with
tiles instead of colored stickers. They are also very cheap (less than U$ 2).
They are (I guess) those Asian cubes that are not that durable. They have
this mechanism of one screw under the center tile. If you twist them many
times they unscrew and come apart but since they are so cheap when I break
one I just buy another one
