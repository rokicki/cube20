It is not to difficult to make cubes or other puzzles without stickers and to
spray paint the surfaces, the price is about the same.  I once made a
Pyraminx test run using this method.  As David Singmaster mentioned the
plastic surface under the sticker has some flow lines which are unavoidable
and the sticker serves in part to hide these imperfections.

The problem with molding the cubes out of colored plastic is the corner
pieces.  as they have to be molded in 3 different colored plastic, such
tooling and molding procedure is extremely expensive and I can not imagine
that India has the technology to produce such an item.  What would make more
sense is to make the stickers out of small clip on plastic tiles such as is
used in my Impossiball this would not increase production cost, but totally
new tooling would need to be made costing around US$50,000.00.  I made a
survey for my Pyraminx many years ago.  Using either colored plastic tiles
or the none slip  fluorescent stickers and the stickers won.

No problem to use different colored plastics only the corner pieces pose a
problem.

As mentioned above there would be no cost increase apart from new tooling
having to be made for the corner pieces and the flow marks on some of the
surfaces will be noticeable.

The best solution would be spray painting, as is being done with my Orbix
and the 4 colored rings on my 3D-Puzzle Balls.

I hope that this clears up your discussion on why Manufacturers use
stickers.
