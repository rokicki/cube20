the "octagon" puzzle has some "edges" with only one visible face.
namely, these are the  U-D layer edges on a cube, which were shaved
when the cube was modified in shape.  these edges have no visible
orientation, so flip one of these along with the edge that's
definitely in the wrong orientation.

in a similar way, it's possible to get positions that appear to have
the wrong permutation parity.  there are four vertical columns of
two corners and an edge each.  these do not have any fixed "home"
location, so that any permutation of these also constitutes a "solved"
state.  (well, at least most people would consider it to be solved.)
but swapping two of these columns creates an odd permutation parity.
thus you can swap two columns, and also swap a pair of edges or
corners, which gives the impression of incorrect parity.

for a simple example, do  R2 F2 R2  from the solved position.
the edges  UF  and  DF  have been swapped, and it looks like nothing
else has happened.  in fact, the  FL  column has been swapped with
the  BR  column as well.

[Moderator's note: I hadn't noticed that this had such an obvious
 answer.  Thanks also to Jon Ferro, Steve LoBasso, der Mouse,
 Guy N. Hurst, Michael Ehrt, and Christ van Willegen for also
 providing the answer.  I've selected Mike Reid's, since he points out
 the other notable ambiguity of the Octagon.

 What wasn't noted is that the Spratt wrench can be used to flip the
 noted edge along with three of the ambiguous edges. --Dan]
