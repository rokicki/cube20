Hi,

My cube is all fixed.

Thank you for your prompt reply.  You were right, the glue used to fix
the caps also fixed the spindle screw! Actually, your instructions
gave me the perfect excuse to take your cube apart.  I was dying to
find out how the heck all these pieces are held together.  

Anyways, I popped of the caps carefully using a razor blade, scraped
off all the excess glue, greased the screw head and before screwing it
back together, I took all the pieces for one face out just to see and
understand the engineering holding all the pieces together. Wow, what
an amazing bit of engineering.  It's like a cube spindle inside
another cube spindle!  Amazing. 

Actually, the center caps don't really need glue.  They fit nice and
snug, and it also leaves me the option to adjust the screw again in
case it becomes loose.

Now that I understand the mechanism, I've decided to only rotate faces
clockwise to minimize the possibility that a counter-clockwise
rotation will actually loosen one of the spindle screws.

I still haven't messed the faces up though. I'm so close to finishing
the Megaminx.  I just have two edge pieces to swap on the last face! 
The other 11 sides were fairly straightforward to solve. I also got
the corners of the last face fairly quickly by using Sune's move to
twist corner pieces (a standard Rubik's cube move).  However, getting
those edge pieces was a different story.  I had to develop quite a few
moves to rotate and twist the edge pieces around.  I'm close... so
close..! :)

I hope you keep inventing and making new puzzles.  I eagerly click on
your new releases on your web page quite regularly, hoping to find a
worthy successor to the Megaminx or the Professor's Cube.  Maybe a
7x7x7?!! Or a Buckyball?  One can only imagine...
