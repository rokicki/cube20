I have been playing around with the idea of trying to calculate God's
Algorithm all the way to the bitter end for the group which results from
ignoring all twists of the corners and flips of the edges.  It's a pretty
big group.  The order is |G|/(3^7)/(2^11), which is about 9.7*10^12, call
it about 10^13 to make it a round number.  (Another way to calculate it is
8!12!/2.)

This is probably right at the bare edge, maybe even slightly past the bare
edge, of the size of problem I can handle right now, which makes it a
worthy endeavor.  Also, it would provide a lower limit on the diameter of
G (although the limit might not be any better than the ones we already
have), which again makes it a worthy endeavor.

Such a result might be suitable as the estimator function required by IDA*
searches.  The distance from Start in the no-twist, no-flip group would
certainly be a lower bound for every position where twist and flip *are*
considered.  My only hesitation about suggesting this group as a suitable
IDA* estimator function is that there are obvious pathological cases such
as the superflip where this function would be a very poor estimator.

In developing a no-twist, no-flip version of the program, I decided to try
it out on the corners only case.  Here are the results.
