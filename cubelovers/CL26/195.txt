I recommend that we accept the same rules as during the 1st (and the last)
world championship. We had a chance to pick up the cube and look at it for
15 seconds. It was then returned to the table and the actual solving
followed. Most competitors actually needed only 5-10 sec. to figure out
the first couple of moves.

Timing? I think most of us when we practice do the timing ourselves.

I have one more point regarding the average. We should standardize
this as well. For example, one can solve the cube 12 times, remove the
worst and the best time and average the remaining 10. Or, do you want to
list all the times during a practice and average them together?
