 The Snake is delightful; you can do some interesting investigations by
starting with a straight config., and twisting each consecutive joint
according to a pattern. Just as long as you don't get physical
interferencies, you see some modestly-interesting shapes.

 It's also worth a bit of casual effort to create a "ball". All of these
things are, however, trivially easy to many of the subscribers to this
list. The snake is for mental relaxation!
