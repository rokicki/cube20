well, if you want "simple", the only two moves you really need
are:

 the edge 3-cycle...  U2^U2v  (UB->DF->UF)
 and the 2-edge flip...  ^U^U^U2vUvUvU2  (flips UF and UB)

assuming you are holding the cube so that the left and right faces are solved
(where ^ is moving the middle slice up, and v is moving the middle slice down)

note, once you get used to those moves, you can create variations that move
and flip, like:

U'^U'^U2vU'vU

these are also REALLY ergonomic - very easy to do rapidly...
