Subject: Summary of Local Maxima, Face Turn Metric

I have posted maneuvers for a number of specific strong and weak 
local maximal positions (the strong local maxima at 9f and 10f, 
and the weak local maxima at 6f) , but I haven't really posted a 
summary of the numbers. Here are the numbers I have so far.  In 
order to complete the table through 10f from Start for weak 
local maxima, I would have to repeat a rather long run.  As 
might be expected, it appears that the number of weak local 
maxima will greatly exceed the number of strong local maxima.

As is the usual case, patterns are M-conjugacy classes (symmetry 
classes), and represent the number of positions which are unique 
up to symmetry.
