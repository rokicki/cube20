I got a similar puzzle in the same way. Mine was called the "Space
Shuttle". The lack of the name Rubik probably meant it wasn't from Rubiks.
But since they only have a patent in Hungary, and everywhere else they are
protected by copyrights on the name and the external appearence, this is
probably legally legitimate. The colour scheme allowed the puzzle to be
solved in more ways than the cube and so I reckon its easier.

Each of the chamfered sides was coloured in a colour which did not relate
to the rest of the puzzle, and so these were (within the boundaries of a
2-swap) possible to position ("correctly") in a few different positions.

The mid-edges of the chamfered edges were rotationally symmetrical every
180 degreees and so, since they were all one colour, it was possible to
have one (or three) of them rotated, and hence one of the other mid edges
rotated and it would look majorly FUBAR'd. Once you'd realised what
happened, the puzzle was easier than the cube though.
