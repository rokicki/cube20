Subject: Re: The Cylinder

I was given a cylinder here in England in 1981.  I no longer have the
packaging, but I suspect it was Taiwanese, unless the Hungarians made
this variant.  It was my first cube puzzle, and its shape was so
unappealing when disturbed that I put it on one side and got a genuine
cube to learn on - well, almost genuine: it came from a street trader
in Regent Street.

The apparently impossible state is a monoflip of a top or bottom edge
piece.  There will be a matching flip of a middle-layer edge piece,
but that will be invisible, since the piece has only one face.

I wondered if it would be possible to get the puzzle into the solved
shape and then restore the positions of the pieces without losing the
shape, that is, only allowing turns from the group <U, D, F2, L2, B2,
R2, S, A>, where S and A are slice and anti-slice moves of the middle
layers (I needed them).  In fact it is not.  There may always be a
hidden flip in the middle layer and you can't correct that without
moving the piece out of the middle layer, which needs a turn like F,
and that destroys the shape.  But if you cheat a little and make sure
the flips are got right before the shape is finally restored, then it
can be done.

Andy  Southern has already made the point about the flips.  He also
pointed out that the configuration is not unique because columns
corresponding to the vertical edges on a normal cube can be swapped.
As a rider to that point, the pretty pattern stripes on the normal
cube is not distinguishable on the octagonal prism, because it's
striped already.

It should be possible to work out whether our moderator's puzzle came
in the form he now has by counting stickers.  The octagonal prism has
2 sets of 9 (the top and bottom) and 8 of 3 (the side columns).  If
I've grasped his configuration correctly, if it came in that form
originally it should have 4 sets of 6 and 6 of 3.

[ Yes, my decahedron's stickers are incompatible with an octagonal
  prism solution.  I just can't remember whether I replaced some of
  the stickers to make this new shape. --Dan ]
