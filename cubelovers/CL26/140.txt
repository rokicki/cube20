Subject: Re: Oddzon version of the cube

	Re: coloured cubies.
	I only ever saw one version of the cube where the black plastic ccubies
had painted faces.  The colours were rather paler than on the ordinary cubes
and one colour was violet.  I can't find it immediately, but I should find it
if I stop an look.
