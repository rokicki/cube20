Kevin,

I do not have an answer for you, but your email made me wonder why stickers
are being used at all? As far as I know, nobody has produced a cube (or
variation) where the plastic "cubies" are colored appropriately without
relying on stickers. Is that process so much more expensive, or do the
toy-makers want to give their customers a chance to cheat by switching the
stickers in case they can't get the puzzle solved?
