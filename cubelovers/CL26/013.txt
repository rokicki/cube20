Subject: Cube Solver for Macintosh

I just wrote a Macintosh port to Dik T. Winter's cube solving code.
I put it on my web page at the link below. I haven't had a chance to make
an info page for it so the link below is just the application.

It will run on both 68k and PPC Native.
Be warned the 68k version runs fairly slow and the initialization phase
takes quite a while.

Cube Solver

By Steve LoBasso

Written using algorithm code by
Dik T. Winter based on algorithm described by Herbert Kociemba.
