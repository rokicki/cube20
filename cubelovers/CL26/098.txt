Puducky@aol.com asked me to forward the following to this list:

I have a 96 year old friend that can do the rubiks cube in less than five
minutes, and near the end he doesn't even look at it! I thought this pretty
amazing for a man of his age. Do you know anyone I can contact about him?
Was wondering if there is a record for his age? Thank you.
