i guess i'm not sure what you're doing, jerry.  but i don't think
it should be *that* difficult.  the number of configurations is
12! = about 480 million.  if you divide out by symmetry, you get
about 10 million configurations.  this should be small enough to
store in memory and do a complete breadth-first search of the space.
