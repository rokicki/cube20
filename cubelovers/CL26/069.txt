Although I don't play with my 5x5x5 much, I do play with the 3x3x3 a lot
and have entertained myself by solving it in many different ways.

The canonical methods:
  1.  First level, second level, third level
  2.  Centers, corners, edges

After much more understanding, however, I now try different techniques
for entertainment.  In order of approximate difficulty:
  0.  Solve to a particular state (pons asinorum, super-flip)
  1.  Corners, edges, centers
  2.  Edges, corners, centers (rather disorienting)
  3.  First level, third level, center slice
  4.  One face at a time, with no regard to correct cubie placement
        as long as the color is correct (this is fun)
  5.  Solve to a particular subgroup (half-turn group, anti-slice group)
        then stay in that subgroup
