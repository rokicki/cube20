You're right about their Cube, but the other Rubik products by OddzOn
are fine, or at least acceptable. For instance, I think the Eclipse is
MUCH better in design than the Magic Strategy Game by Matchbox, 10 years
earlier. Same game, but much more attractive and somehow also better
gameplay.
Another example is Rubik's Bricks, which is Rubik's version of the Soma
Cube. There is a short mention of it in "Cubic Compendium", but OddzOn
were the first to market it - and their version is excellent!

BTW has anyone seen/tried any of the other new stuff by OddzOn, like
"Rubik's Infinity" or Rubik's Double Tangram" ???
