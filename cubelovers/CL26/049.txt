It is difficult.  I also took a long time to solve it, but I used a very
different solution.  Check out www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/5x5x5.html for
my solution.  Perhaps you can combine the best moves of both solutions to
find a way of solving this interesting puzzle that you find most pleasing.
If you do use my solution and have any comments about how I can make it
better, either in my writing or my moves, please let me know.
