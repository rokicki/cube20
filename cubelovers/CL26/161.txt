That's not a big problem. Underneath each center piece there's a screw
(just like in some (or all?) 3x3s, although we don't need to open it to
take it apart). Just open one of them and the whole thing comes apart.
And if you've never taken it apart, enjoy the beautiful mechanism.
Putting it together again is a pretty nice puzzle itself :-)
