Subject: The Cylinder
To: cube <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

I was checking the Rubik official website and I was
surprised not to find one product that I seem to find
here (I live in Colombia South America) fairly
easily. I am talking about the cylinder.
When I first saw it I bought it and thought it was
going to be some amazing and tricky to solve puzzle,
it ended up being a 3x3 cube with the corners cut, so
corner cubelets only have 2 colors and there are two
types of borders, 8 borders with the usual two colors
and 4 with only one.

Does it mean that this cube was "invented" by some
manufacturer other than Mr Rubik and that is not so
common?

[Moderator's note: I own such a puzzle, but I would call its shape
 an octagonal prism, rather than a cylinder.  On mine, the solved
 position is not an octagonal prism because one beveled face is
 rotated 90 degrees, forming a decahedron whose faces are six
 rectangles and four irregular hexagons. I don't remember whether
 it was originally manufactured this way or whether I altered the
 color tabs. ]
