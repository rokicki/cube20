Subject: Query for Corners-First Method Rubik Solution
To: cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu


Hi,

Does anyone know of any websites that describe the Corners-first
method of the solving the rubik's cube?  I know of many layer-first
methods such as Jiri Fridrich's (for which I have spent many hours
learning), but I really haven't seen a comprehensive explanation of
the corners-first method.  I'm really curious to understand how anyone
can solve the cube under 30secs by solving the corners first.
