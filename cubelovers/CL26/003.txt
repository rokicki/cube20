My apologies for a delayed reply.

Hana's essay was rather philosophical, and contained some uncommon
points of view; it was appropriate, in my opinion.

One aspect of the Cube (and related puzzles) that seemed to be ignored
is the remarkable ingenuity of their internal mechanisms. I maintain
that the mechanism of the original (i.e., 3^3) Rubik's Cube is one of
the most ingenious ever invented.

I recall being very fatigued, riding the West Side IRT subway in NYC
about 2 AM, perhaps, and catching sight of someone manipulating what
must have been one of the very first Cubes, probably from Hungary*. I
was fairly sure I wasn't hallucinating, but was very troubled that what
I'd seen simply appeared impossible. I've been a somewhat-casual student
of mechanisms all my life.

*This was probably several weeks, or more, before the Scientific
American article, and the later explosion of its popularity.

My regards to all,
