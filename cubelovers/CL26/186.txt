I received as a present many years ago the Game of Rubik's Cube.  (I forget
the exact name)  but just in case anyone wonders about it, it is a hard
mechanism to turn.  The cubies each had plastic colored blocks fitted into
the cube surface with holes for pegs.  What you were supposed to do was
place a peg into a hole then play some game with an opponent.  Does anyone
else have this cube game?  How rare is this?

Also, I wish to start a new topic about the cube.  Has anyone ever thought
of making a large cube out of wood so that there is a lot of wood (or clay)
on the outside of the cube and then carve something like a human head out
of the material? (a bust)  Then the object is to scramble and reconstruct
the head.  (Has this been talked about before?)  I think a white bust of
an ancient Greek (like white marble statues) would be cool.
