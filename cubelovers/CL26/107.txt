Sorry if I'm retreading old ground but I'm new to this.

1.
	I remember reading somewhere an article that advocated solving
the middle layer of the cube last.  I have got some fairly short moves
to place cubes from the middle layer onto the bottom layer, but when it
comes to solving the middle layer, I seem to be trusting to luck that I
have reached a favourable position.  I cannot see how I am going to
reduce my average number of moves to solve the cube using this method.
I think there are two possibilities:-

	1.  There are some cool moves for solving the middle layer last
that I have missed.
	2.  I should forget about solving the middle layer last, and
stick to my usual method
	(ie. top,middle,bottom)

2.
	A more general question is: What is the shortest (practical)
method for solving the cube that anyone knows of?  (keyword: "practical"
- don't say 22 moves)

Thanks,
