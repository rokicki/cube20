Cubes like that are probably more expensive to manufacture. However, a
"Deluxe" version, using plastic tiles, was produced by Ideal in the
early 80's. Pretty hard to get now, i'm afraid.
I also have one that seems newer, this also has plastic tiles. It came
on a card, that had the name "Old Brand Magic Cube" on it. The back of
the card has a (poor) solution printed, and there is also a picture of
an Octagon, supposedly by same manufacturer. Apart from the plastic
tiles, there is nothing deluxe about this last one - the turning is o.k.
but not VERY smooth.
