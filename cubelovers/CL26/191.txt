Well, I fiddled with it and finally managed to get one of my 5-Cubes
apart (I used the one with the loose stickers).

I found it more effective to turn a "thick slice" (ie, the outer two
slices turned together) about 45 degrees, then pry with my thumb
between the corner and wing of the turned slice.  (This is perhaps
ambiguous.  Start with a solved 5-Cube, turn the U face 45 degrees
clockwise, so the URF cubie and the RF wing cubie next to it are just
above the middle of the F face.  Then stick your thumb between those
two cubies, nail towards the URF corner cubie, and lever the wing cubie
down.)  It's harder to get the last wing cubie back in than it is to
take the first wing cubie out, but by reversing the move I described
above I find it not too difficult.

Now I just need to find paints that will stick well to the plastic
these things are made of.  (The paints I used for the 3-Cube I painted
don't stick as well as I'd like.)

True.  Quite impressive to look at.  Indeed, once you've taken out the
off-center face cubies and the wing cubies, you're left with something
that looks like a ricketey skeletal 3-Cube (and indeed can, if you're
careful, be manipulated as such).

Amusingly, I realized that as long as you get that "ricketey 3-Cube"
put together in its solvable orbit, it's impossible to put the rest of
the 5-Cube together unsolvably!  (Unless you've marked the face cubies
so they're distinguishable, of course.)
