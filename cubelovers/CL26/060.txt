The appearance is particularly striking on the 4X cube.  Especially in the
situation where the two out-of-place "wings" are side-by-side.

It looks very similar to a solved 3X cube with a single edge-cubie flipped.
This is an interesting state to leave your cube in, when it is just lying
around your office, for visitors to find.
