 I've pulled mine apart a *few* times. Imho, it's probably impossible to
reassemble without some forcing. If it were made of cheap plastic, I
very much doubt that it could be assembled. Study the structure, so
you won't try to assemble it wrong; you probably wouldn't make such a
mistake, though. Hope you didn't lose any pieces! (Be *sure* to match
colors properly before assembling; of course, you know that, too.)

 My hopeful guess is that you'll succeed, but be rather amazed by the
force it takes, and also that the plastic can take such stress. I have
seen 2^3s on sale fairly recently, btw, so there has been a stock of
them, possibly a new production run.

 I've been a mechanical tech. at times for several decades, so I'm
reasonably sure of what I say. I've pulled apart many movable-part
puzzles, and the 2^3 is surely the most intractable of all I've dealt
with.  Alexanders' Star and the 4^3 have some parts that are easy to
break.

 I'd love to know how it's done at the factory. I hope it's not some
subtle ultrasonic welding. (Maybe someone could ask Dr. Christoph
Bandelow, Dr. Uwe Meffert, or (Dr.?*) David Singmaster.)

*Sorry if I forget!

Best regards, and good luck!
