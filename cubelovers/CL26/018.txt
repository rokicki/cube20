Subject: Moves to this other pattern
To: cube <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

Please if this is not one of the purposes of this
list someone let me know I don't meant to be rude.

Could someone please tell me the moves to get from a
solved cube to the following pattern:
The top and bottom faces keep their colors.
The 4 columns in the middle of every side face stay
with their color.
The left column on the front face moves to the right
and the right column moves to the left.
The left column on the back face moves to the right
and the right column moves to the left.

Thanks

  figuring out how to look them up.  This is one of the "4-" patterns,
  and probably appears among the quasi-continuous partial isoglyphs. --Dan ]
