I too found a "tiled" cube that was about $5 USD with plastic tiles rather
than stickers.  At first this seemed ideal since there can be no wear and
tear on the stickers.  However quite soon afterwards the tiles start to come
off.  Perhaps if they were glued better...

I would be willing to pay more for puzzles of better quality.  On a similar
note, old versions of the Rubik's Revenge puzzle are fetching prices over
$75 USD.  The puzzles are basically unusable, as they are so stiff and
brittle from age that they fall apart.  The best buy is to buy a used
Rubik's Revenge, one that was actually used during the 80s and was worn in.
These puzzles are not so stiff and are actually usable.

Anyway back to my point, I was wondering how many people on this list would
be interested in getting a manufacturer to do a good quality run of 4x4x4
cubes?  A place in the U.S. called "Puzzlets" was supposed to have a sign up
list to create a production run of these cubes, but I have heard that they
are no longer in business.  Perhaps there is enough interest in the cube
lovers' list?

[Moderator's note: Has anyone else found aged, unused 4^3s more brittle than
 the originals? Even the early ones were usually stiff; I needed to take
 them apart and apply wax or other lubricant.  And still they broke much
 too easily, due to the tiny necks on the face centers.  Perhaps the only
 advantage aged, used cubes have is that the stiff ones whose owners didn't
 lubricate them are long broken. --Dan]
