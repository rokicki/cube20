Subject: Temporary Fix for OddzOn Sticker Peel
To: Cube Lovers <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

Hi,

For those folks out there, like myself, frustrated with OddzOn sticker
peel problem, there is an effective method to prolonging the life of
these pitiful stickers. I got this technique from one of the posts on
the Rubik's website.

Currently, the plastic laminate that makes up the surface of the
stickers for OddzOn Rubik's Cubes starts to peel at the edges after
only a few weeks of intensive playing.

Well, get yourself some long-lasting acrylic nail polish and paint
over all the stickers. (Make sure you do this when the cube is brand
new.) I know, it's a pain in the ass, but it's worth it. The first
coat lasts for about 2-3 weeks before the edges start peeling again.
What I do then is take a razor blade and cut off the peeled away
sections and then nail polish over the stickers again.  You'll
probably get another 2-3 weeks of intensive play again before the cut
laminate starts peeling again.  However, after I repeated this process
once more (razor blade cut/nail polish over), the stickers have now
lasted over several months without additional peel. Hope this helps...
