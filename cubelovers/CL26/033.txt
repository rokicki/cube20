Subject: Getting 2x2x2 cubes

If anyone is interested in getting 2x2x2 cubes, during my holiday in the
UK two weeks ago I found a shop in Sheffield which has them in stock.
It's called "The Puzzle Shop" and in situated in Meadowhall shopping
centre. The cubes are GBP 5 each, and they have a few other things like
keyring 3x3x3s etc.
