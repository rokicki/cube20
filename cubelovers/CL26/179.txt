As nearly as I can remember, you can begin dismantling one of these by
rotating the top slice by maybe 30 degrees or so, then prying upward on
one of the "wing" cubies (between the center and the corner cubies). Use
your thumb, nail side down, and lift.

Experiment with different amounts of rotation; you'll find a position
where the "wing" cubie's "foot" will push aside many others. Once it's
disengaged, life becomes easier.

This method, if you choose the proper cubie to pry, and align it
properly with the "loosest" neighbor below it, is harmless.

Just possible that I'm suggesting the wrong cubie to pry, but iirc, the
center cubies are more directly held than the "wings".

Believe me, the insides of a 5^3 are utterly amazing. The scheme used
for the 3^3 can't hold a 5^3 together unaided; the mechanism is an
extension of that in the 5^3, but has an additional set of retaining
surfaces, generally spherical in their geometry.  The shape of a "foot"
on a corner cubie is something to behold; it could be a bit of a
challenge to define it in a CAD program.

As I've said before, don't even think of allowing your cat to watch
the process!

Sorting the pieces for reassembly is part of the fun.
