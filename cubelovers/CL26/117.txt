Hello,  I remember someone asked if there were two different mechanisms 
to the 2x2x2 cube but I can't remember if it was answered.  Last night
while doing a patent search I came across a mechanism totally different
than what my own cube looks like.  It is U.S. Patent # 5826871  Oct '98
Basically, it is a standard Rubik's Cube with the central layers hidden
underneath and one quadrant is fixed in place.  I am wondering if there 
exists a web site with all the diagrams of all different puzzles from
their patent pages.  As you may know, patents and patent diagrams are 
*not* covered by copyright issues, you may photocopy them for personal
viewing and even display them on a web page.  I think such a web page
would be nice to have; a web page of all the diagrams of the working 
mechanisms of all the puzzles discussed on this list.  (The thing is 
though that soon the U.S. Patent office will be adding the diagrams to
their web pages. www.uspto.gov)   Anyone wish to start such a page?
I have access to a patent depository.  :-)
