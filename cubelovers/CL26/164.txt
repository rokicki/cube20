Subject: Re: Fwd: Request for spectacular cube-solving - Can anyone help ?

	Very hard to have a person do just one move and pass it on.  Perhaps
allow five seconds?
	A bit of spectacular solving would be to have someone make five or six
moves and let the solver work out how to unscramble it in the same number of
moves.  Kate Fried in Budapest could do four moves, perhaps five, regularly.
