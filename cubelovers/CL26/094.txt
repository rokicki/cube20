May I help without being too much vituperated for making an unseemly
advertisement? Christoph Bandelow's email address is

Christoph.Bandelow@ruhr-uni-bochum.de

He does not only sell excellent 5x5x5 Magic Cubes (the good old ones
made in Hong Kong, not in mainland China), but also Magic
Dodecahedra, Skewbs, Pyraminxes, Impossiballs, various Puzzle Balls,
Mach Balls and other Rubik type puzzles and books about those
puzzles. It is a pleasure to deal with him for he is quick,
absolutely reliable, fair and competent. Free mail order catalog.
