Hi,

This is a stunningly elegant move.  You've reduce the difficulty in
solving the 4th layer by an order of magnitude.  I tried this move
out, actually it swaps two centrals:

F-face md <-> D-face lM (mid central swap)
F-face rd <-> D-face lf (right central swap)

Beautiful move.

There is one particular move that I haven't figured out yet.  It pops
up occasionally when I solve the edges of the D-layer.  Sometimes I
end up with every cubie in place except for two right centrals on
adjacent faces. For example: F-face rD and L-face Lf.  The two pieces
only need to be swapped.  No flipping is needed.  Does anyone know how
to perform this move?  I've been beating the Puzzler program for a
while, but I have been unsuccessful so far.
