Subject: Nicholas Bodley's message of 22 Sep 1998.

	Nicholas Bodley's message reminds me of when I wrote about the Cube in
1978 or early 1979, I think in the Observer, which seems to have been the first
article outside Hungary.  I mentioned that the mechanical problem seemed even
harder than the mathematical problem and this led to about six submissions of
mechanisms from readers.  All but one of these were clearly impossible, but the
last was Rubik's mechanism with slight differences - e.g. he had the undersides
of the centers rounded.  The submitter of this was a UK patent agent with
obvious mechanical aptitude.
	However, one of my students, who had bought a cube from me, told me
that a friend rang her up and asked if she had seen the hoax article about a
cube that moved in all directions.  The friend had just proven that such an
object was impossible.  My student had to disabuse her.
	When the cubes first came out of Hungary, we didn't know what the
mechanism was and they were too precious to fiddle with.  Roger Penrose said he
had one face center piece come undone and he carefully wrapped thread around
the exposed part of the screw and worked the screw into place and pulled on the
thread to screw the screw  back into the central piece.  Sometime in late 1978,
a friend had trouble with his cube and took a screwdriver to it and discovered
the cover plates and the screw heads inside!
	Enough for now.
