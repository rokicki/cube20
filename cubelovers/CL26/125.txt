I am curious if anyone has had the same problems with the current official
Rubik's cube that is in production.  I bought a Rubik's cube last year in a
toy store.  This was the newest version made by Oddzon.  I noticed that
there was a clear sticker overtop of each of the colored stickers.  In less
than a month this clear sticker peeled up.  I just don't remember the
original cubes by Ideal wearing down that fast.  In fact I still have a
couple cubes from Ideal with stickers still intact.

I contacted Oddzon by email and have received several responses from them,
forwarding my email to the appropriate department.  Currently my concern is
with under review by the Quality Control and Marketing department.  They
have claimed that this concern about the stickers is not common.  Maybe I
just got a bad cube, I don't know.  But, in order for them to make a better
product, I'm sure it's going to take a strong voice from the people
actually buying the products.  I just encourage everyone if they have
experienced the same thing with the stickers with the Oddzon product, to
contact them.

Most of the time, I still play with my cube I got from Ideal from 1982.  It
was called "Rubik's Cube Deluxe".  It was the official Rubik's cube that had
colored tiles instead of stickers.  That cube is holding up like new.  I
also made a motion to Oddzon to put the "Rubik's Cube Deluxe" back into
production.  That motion is now with the Senior Marketing Manager at
Oddzon.  It's his voice to decides which products go into production.  I
also encourage anyone that wants to see that version back into production,
to contact Oddzon.

Oddzon has been incredibly helpful and incredibly nice.  They have informed
me that two new Rubik's products will be coming out this year from Oddzon.
They should be out by the middle of the summer.  They werent at liberty to
say what products they were.  I can think of some that I'd like to see back
into production.  I'll have to wait and see.

On another note.  I do not endorse ebay, however, I have had a bit of
success with ebay.  I won two different auctions on ebay.  They were both
for Cubes by Ideal, never opened or played with, cellophane still intake.
I was lucky enough to get them for under 20 bucks apiece.  But, use
caution.  I wouldn't recommend ever auctioning on an item from a seller
with negative or low feedback.  Definantly be careful.  I've been really
lucky with the products I've won.

Cheers,
Kevin
