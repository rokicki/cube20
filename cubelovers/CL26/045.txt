Dear Cube Lovers,

I have written a website for Uwe Meffert (with input from both W. David
Joyner and David Byrden) that can be found at:

http://www.ue.net/mefferts-puzzles/

and was speaking with him earlier today.

Uwe is going to make another batch of Professor Cubes (5x5x5) in the next
week or so, and is taking orders through his site.

This is a subject that is often raised on the newsgroup, and I hope people
don't think of this as taking too much of a liberty.

The website contains a credit card order page, information about the puzzles
(including a solution to all of his popular puzzles) and multiple links to
other pages. Whilst I am not involved with the day to day running of the
website, if people would like their pages added to the links, please forward
the URL to this address WITH A SHORT SUMMARY that will appear with the link.

Puzzle available include some of the more recent ones (Orbix, Pyramorphix,
Megaminx, Prof Cube).

I am told that orders *may* still be on time for delivery before Chirstmas.

I hope this has been of use to you guys,

Andy Southern.
