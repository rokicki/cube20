No, it's not just you.  I had this exact problem with an Oddzon cube.
Eventually all Oddzon cubes will develop this problem after any extended
use, I believe.  The "stickers" appear to be actually nothing more than
some sort of colored paper glued to the cube surface, with a thin
transparent plastic film covering the paper.

Like Kevin mentions, this plastic film begins to peel up at the corners
and edges of the stickers after extended usage of the cube, perhaps due to
fingerprint oils.  Eventually the film will fall off (or it gets to the
point where it must be deliberately removed), and the underlying colored
paper is completely ruined not long after.  I noticed this very same
phenomenon with one of the "C4" cubes, those cubes with Rubik's profile in
the center of the one of the sides.

It seems that these newly manufactured cubes are not up the level of
quality of cubes from "back in the day".  All of the original Ideal cubes
that I have seen have stickers that appear to be made of straight colored
plastic.  Even the clone knock-offs from that era used these stickers.
These solid plastic stickers seem to hold up much better than the
paper-based ones used on the Oddzon products.  After my disappointing
results with my Oddzon cube, I pledged to never again buy one of their
products until they change or improve their sticker design.
