I recently obtained (courtesy of Peter Beck) the Rubik's Cube-a-Thon video
from the TV show "THAT'S INCREDIBLE" and digitized it in RealVideo format.
The file is rather large (18.1 megabytes) but it's worth a download if
you're into cubic nostalgia.  Eleven and a half minutes long, it features
Minh Thai, Jeff Varasano, Kris Wunderlich, and others that may be on this
list.

Here's the URL:

It requires the RealPlayer 5.0 or later to view it.  Note that you must
download the file, then view it.  I do not have a streaming video server.
If anyone would like to host the file on a streaming server, please contact
me.
