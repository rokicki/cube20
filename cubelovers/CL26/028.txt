Hi,

Thanks for the link to your Puzzler program.

You're not going to believe this, but you can still purchase the
Professor's Cube (5x5x5) and the Megaminx! Since it's difficult... no,
impossible to find anyone that sell these puzzles, I think it's worth
mentioning. You can get them from Meffert's site:
http://ue.net/mefferts-puzzles/

Your Puzzler program is a tremendously useful tool to develop moves.
I've got 11/12 sides of the Megaminx solved.  But for the last side, I
need to figure out corner/edge twisting/permuting moves.  You're
Puzzler program's great for that.  I'm surprised how many of my
Rubik's cube moves can be applied with minor modifications to the
Megaminx.
