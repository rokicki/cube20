Subject:  (5x5x5) edge parity corrections
To: Cube Lovers <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

I don't like the edge parity correction move that I use in my solution, and
I'm hoping that someone can give me a better one.

The parity problem is found in 5x5x5 cubes (and 4x4x4 cubes, I understand)
when two of the edges right next to the corners (which I call "wings") are
switched.  Some fairly simple moves can get all three edges in line with
each other, but half the time two wings need to be switched.  By the time I
figure this out when doing a 5x5x5 cube, I've solved most of it, and my
parity fixing move messes up many of the edges I've been working on.

How do other people fix this problem?
