This question is directed to both Herbert and Mike Reid in case he's
reading this list:  With all this discussion of the "Professor Cube"
lately, how hard would it be to extend either Optimal cube solving program
to handle 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes in addition to the traditional 3x3x3?
Considering reasonable table files (50 - 100 mb), how much longer would
the computation time be extended by.  If either of you would find the time
to implement this modification, I would be very interested in trying out
the program.
