These "cubes" were made by Disney in Spain. They work with a 
2x2x2 mechanism. The mechanism seems to be different to the 
one used in the Rubik's Mini Cube - you can see a screw inside 
the "cube" when turning slightly on two axis simultaniously. A bit 
similar to the Pyramorphix - maybe these were also manufactured 
by Meffert ?

I have seen them for sale at Puzzle-shop
www.puzzle-shop.de
and from Pete Beck/Just Puzzles
www.freeyellow.com/members4/justpuzzles/

They are quite fun to operate - one can turn Mickey's ears so they 
point backwards instead of upwards, or turn his eyes so they look 
like i don't know what. Pretty perverse ;-)
