It's not the characters that count, just the numbers of dots. And it
seems to be reasonably easy to read the number of dots in any
position.

Besides, it was the easiest and quickest thing we could think of.

The problem with (most) blind people is lack of 3D concepts (I'd
almost put a Duh! here). I know I solve the first layer of the
cube with insight in the movement of cubelets. I've had lots of
trouble describing what I do to my friend! Diagrams are impossible
to draw, so you'd have to describe in words _exactly_ where cubelets
are to be placed w.r.t. the rest of the cube before a formula can
be applied.

Too bad we didn't have any time to practise, yet. But we will!

That's also a nice idea. I might try that if the braille dots thing
doesn't work. Do you have pictures of this thing on-line?

[Moderator's reply: No pics, but the above description should get you
 pretty close.  The only symbols you might want help with are
    Dot: Made with a short tight spiral of wire,
    Plus and X: Double-outlined so that they can be made with a
         continuous strand of wire, end to end.
 After gluing them down, I put an extra cover of cement to protect the
 wire and blunt the sharp ends.  Silicone protectant ("Armor All" TM in
 the US) gives it a good feel.  I used steel wire about .2mm thick,
 like a paperclip, but perhaps I should stay vague so you will invent
 your own variation. ]

Dr. Bandelow! Please adjust your machines to make cubes like this :-)
