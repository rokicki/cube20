Hi, cube lovers. I have a few questions.
Does anyone know if Erno Rubik is still alive?
About 4 years I vaguely remember seeing a large star-shaped
rubiks puzzle. Does anyone know where I can find one?
I am also looking for a 4x4x4 and a 5x5x5 cube. Where can I
find one?

Thanks to all.

[ Moderator's note: Cube-lovers-request gets a lot of requests for
  information on finding 4^3 and 5^3 puzzles.  I'm pretty sure there
  is no source of 4^3 puzzles, except for the occasional auction.
  Last I heard Uwe Meffert sells 5^3 puzzles at
