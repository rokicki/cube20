Subject: Moves to this pattern
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

Hi I just joined the list!

I was wondering if someone could help me with a
pattern that has been bugging me for a while.
I have been able to solve the cube to this pattern so
i know it is a valid one.
I used one of those on-line solvers entered the
pattern and then reversed the sequence the solver
gave me and it indeed gets the pattern i want but
somehow it seemed too many moves for me for such a
simple pattern.
the pattern I am talking about is: the 4 cubelets
that make the vertex formed by FDR are exchanged with
the vertex from BDL

Can any one give me the set of moves to get to this
pattern from a solved cube? Does this pattern have a
name?

[Here is a] set of moves (they work but I am
sure there is a shorter way):

D2 F B- L2 F- B D- F B- L F- B D2 F B- L2 F- B D F B-
L- F- B F B- L- F- B D2 F B- L- F- B D2 R- D- R D- R-
D2 R D2 L- D- L B D- B- L- D L2 D L- D- F- D- F D B-
D- B D R D R- D F- B D B- F R D- R- T B- T- B- D- B-

This long set of moves reminds me of something else:
There are many Rubik cube annimations that you move
the faces with either the keypad or the mouse. Does
anyone know of one that follows sets of orders you
write?

It would be neat to try this long patterns in one of
those simulators.

Thanks
