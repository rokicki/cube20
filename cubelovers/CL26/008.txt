Subject: Is it only mine?
To: cube <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

In order to solve the cube faster I developed a
method that would turn a lot the middle faces. I
don't know how you call them in this list I am
talking about the face between Top and Bottom, the
face between Right and Left and even the face between
Front and Back.
Well after twisting it a few times my cube came
undone, fell apart and I thought "Damn made in Taiwan
cubes" (although the ones I can buy here do not say
where are they made). I was going through my second
cube in a short while (I just regained interest in
the cube a short while ago after say 15 years) and it
fell apart again. I took off the plastic color of the
center cubelet that came apart and found a screw and
a spring that keeps the screw tight. I re screwed it
but did not have any glue at hand so I kept on
playing without the color of the center cubelet I was
doing one of these center face moves and saw how the
screw was turning counterclockwise in other words the
way that makes the cube fall apart. Needless to say I
had to re design my method.
This long story is to ask if all the cubes are built
this way or only the ordinary ones I can buy here?
Thanks.
