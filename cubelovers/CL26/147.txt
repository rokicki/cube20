A while ago, I took the smoothest-acting Cube I have, peeled off all
the stickers, took the thing apart, and painted all the facicles.
Et voila! no more sticker problems!

Now, I just need to do that with one of the 5-Cubes I have, the one
that's suffering from the Dread Orange Sticker Disease; it's already
lost one orange sticker completely, and about four more are so loose
that only a piece of masking tape is keeping them with the Cube.
(Assuming I can figure out how to get it apart non-destructively.)

I agree, it would be much more pleasant if the plastic itself were
coloured.  But that would require at least six different plastics,
instead of one, which is probably why it's not done commercially.
Low volume already makes the things expensive....

On the other hand, I wonder how much more it really would cost to do
coloured plastics.  Anyone with enough experience in the industry to
say?
