This is remindful of a technique I used many years ago to
reduce the size of the search space for the 2x2x2 problem,
and the issue would apply to any cube such as the 4x4x4
with an even number of cubies per edge.  That is, in the
(2n)x(2n)x(2n) problem you can treat as equivalent any
positions of the form (m1)*x*(m2) for m1 and m2 in M,
provided only that both of m1 and m2 are rotations or that
both of m1 and m2 are reflections.

Another (and in some ways better) way to model a
(2n)x(2n)x(2n) problem and to reduce the size of the search
space is to fix one of the corners and to use the symmetry
group which preserves the major diagonal axis which includes
the corner which is fixed, but that is a different issue.

Dan Hoey showed that (m1)*x*(m2) is equivalent to m'xmc for
suitable choices of m and c, for m in M and for c in C (the
set of 24 rotations).  Requiring that m1 and m2 both be
rotations or both be reflections is necessary because you
really can't turn the corners inside out on a physical
cube.

Herbert does not impose the same restriction on both of m1
and m2 being rotations or reflections because his third
coordinate applies only to the edges, and the edges can
indeed be turned inside out on a physical cube, namely with
the Pons Asinorum maneuver. So for this case, (m1)*x*(m2)
is equivalent to m'xmc if m1 and m2 are both rotations or
both reflections, and is equivalent to m'xmcv if they are
not, where v is the central inversion of the edges
(essentially, the Pons Asinorum applied to the edges).

I used to talk about 1152-fold symmetry for the 2x2x2
(1152=24*48).  Herbert's approach for the third coordinate
yields a 2304-fold reduction in the search space
(2304=48*48).  However, the reductions in the search space
in the two cases are not really dealing with quite the same
issue. In the case of 1152-fold symmetry for the 2x2x2,
there are (up to) 1152 equivalent positions which are the
same distance from Start. If I am understanding Herbert's
technique correctly, when positions are equivalent in the
third coordinate, there are (up to) 2304 positions of
the edges for which the distance from Start has the same
lower bound.  (Maybe I should say "the same non-trivial
lower bound", because (for example) zero would be a lower
bound for all positions.)
