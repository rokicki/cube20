You should use a small Phillips screwdriver to remove one of the triangular
flanges that forms the tracks that the "cubies" ride in. Then, put the
"cubie" pieces in place and then g_e_n_t_l_y spread the space between the 4
"cubie" surfaces that hide the stump that holds the triangular flange and
put the screw back in.

Be careful not to break the shaft between the cubie face and its anchor.
