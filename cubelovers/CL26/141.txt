Subject: Re: Oddzon version of the cube

	It's depressing that manufacturers can't provide a decent cube.  When
the C4 cube was introduced about 10(?) years, I found the mechanism very poor
and poeple told me that their examples broke within an hour of buying it.  As
you say, the Asian pirates had become very good in 1982 or so and I believe
Ideal was actually buying production from some of the same companies.
	Regarding cubes with printed colours, I have located mine.  It has
violet replacing orange, but is otherwise the usual colours and arrangement.
The colours are pretty good, but because the plastic surface is not perfectly
smooth, it gives the effect of a matte finish, rather than a glossy finish,
which is why I remember the colours as a bit paler.  My records indicate this
was bought in a regular Rubik Cube packaging, but I don't recall when and I've
never seen the technique used again.  I suppose one has to place squares of
coloured material against the cube and then fuse the colour into the surface of
the plastic and this seems likely to be more expensive than the use of
stickers.  The elimination of orange may be due to the fact that many orange
colours are based on cadmium which is toxic and not permitted on objects for
children.
