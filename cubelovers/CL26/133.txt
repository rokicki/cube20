What about solving the cube while performing a full-length rap?
I even know someone who can do that: MYSELF ;-)
Actually I am a singer, but I _do_ rap from time to time _and_ I also 
happen to speak german. But I can't joggle :-(

[Moderator's note: Philip also mentions his good experiences with ebay.
 The cube-lovers list isn't running a poll on them, so no one else needs to
 send reports of their performance.  Pay your money, take your chances, seek
 advice from appropriate sources. ]
