i usually do it cold.  i use the layer-by-layer method, so a preview
isnt really all that advantageous.  i've tried jiri's method, but i
couldnt get used to it, and only once managed to break 60 secs with it.

i just use my watch, with the alarm set to go off, and the display reading
the seconds (so the alarm goes off at :00) and then look when i've
completed the cube.
