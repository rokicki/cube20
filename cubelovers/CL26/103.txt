Subject: From Monica Lewinsky to the Roubik Cube


Bill,

   Here is a quotation that might be appropriate for The
Mathematical Gazette.

   Senator Trent Lott (R-Missouri), Senate Majority Leader,
speaking on 6th January, 1999, to reporters about arrangements
for the impeachment of the President, declared, ``All sides
of this Rubik's cube have been talked about. We hope to have
this all resolved tomorrow''. [As quoted in The New York Times
for 7th January, p. A1.]

   The natural inference here is that Senators have a version of
the Rubik cube on which the US President and friends are depicted,
the object of the exercise being to twist things so as to get
the US President into or out of compromising positions - it was
thoughtful of the Senate Majority Leader to spare us the details,
and to leave this to our imagination.

   DGR.
