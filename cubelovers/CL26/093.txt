}Hi, cube lovers. I have a few questions.

Quite likely. There's a Website that might help you find out:

http://www.rubiks.com

Try a Web search (I like the meta-search engines; Metasearch and
Metafind are a couple).

}About 4 years I vaguely remember seeing a large star-shaped

It might well have bees Alexander's Star. As to finding one, sorry to
say, I can't help. Rather sure it wasn't a Rubik design, though. It was
harder to manipulate mechanically than one might like. Not sure, but I
think I've seen it it a store. You might try a Web puzzle dealer.
 (...Puzzletts.com ?)

} Does anyone know where I can find one? I am also looking for a 4x4x4
}and a 5x5x5 cube. Where can I find one?

For the 5^3, in addition to Meffert, as Dan said, Dr. Christoph
Bandelow, in Germany, was selling them, as well, I'm almost certain. The
store [The Games People Play] on Mass. Ave. in Cambridge, Mass., might
have them in stock. Sorry, but I've lost track of Dr. Bandelow's
address.

My general impression is that there's enough interest in the 5^3 to have
revived production, although it could have been just one big run. Fwiw,
(honestly, not much!), my experience regarding the 4^3 agrees with Dan's
comments.
