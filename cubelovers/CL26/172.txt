Really?  I haven't noticed this in my own collection as far as I can see.

I think this would be an excellent idea.

Is Puzzletts out of business?  Their web site is still up at least.  Check
it out at:

A year or two ago I had the very good fortune of stumbling across a number
of 4x4x4 cubes that were brand new in their unopened original boxes from
1982.  Of the two cubes that I personally opened and used extensively, I
did not notice any unusual stiffness.  The 4x4x4 does suffer from the
known weak neck in the center pieces that is prone to snapping, but aside
from that the cubes were in excellent condition and have held up very
well.  I'm not sure if lubricating the cube will remedy the tendency for
the neck to break, but perhaps it would since it seems to happen when the
cube jams slightly.  The first of the two cubes to suffer a broken center
piece became my spare parts cube that I use to keep the other in good
running condition.
