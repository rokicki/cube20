There is a Taiwanese manufacture of the octagonal prism.  I have
part of one in my collection.  (Got it when I was 10, and many
cubies have disappeared since then.)

I also have one of the "truncated cubes" mentioned earlier in this
thread.

I find the discussion on these two quite strange, since I always
thought of these as cubes with weird cubies -- no more special than,
say, that spherical "cube" they had a few years back.
