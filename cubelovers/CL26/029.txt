Subject: Use of the name Rubik's Cube

        The lawyers are being obsessively zealous as the name is
certainly well on its way to becoming a common noun.  It was included
in the Oxford English Dictionary in the mid-1980s.  Other examples are
Kleenex and Aspirin, which were both originally tradenames and their
owners fought to retain them but eventually lost.  Xerox is fighting a
rear-guard action on its name.  If you don't want to get involved in
legal hassle, I suggest that you use the name  Magic Cube  which was
the original name and is such a common term that they can't claim it
is a trademark.

[ Moderator's note: I am still dropping messages that consist mainly of
  generic comments on intellectual property issues.  There a great variety
  of individualistic and contentious debate on these topics that you may
  follow in dedicated fora such as the Usenet group misc.int-property.  I
  am not yet persnickety enough to elide the third and fourth sentences
  from the above, but they are on the edge.

  I will also note that the term "Magic Cube" is also used to refer to a
  cubical array of natural numbers whose orthogonal and diagonal rows sum
  to the same number, as a generalization of "Magic Square", so it is
  advisable to include context such as "The geometrical puzzle originally
  known as the Hungarian Magic Cube." ]
