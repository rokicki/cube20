Subject: Speed cube times

Hello All,

There doesn't seem to be any records these days kept of people's current
solving times for the cube. Perhaps they should be shared here?

My current time for solving the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube is 47 seconds using
the Petrus method and involved:

Building the 2x2x2,
finishing the bottom and mid layer, 
1 edge alignment, 
1 corner swap, 
2 sunes, 
and 1 clockwise edge rotation.

How are other people's speeds fairing?
