I was wrong... They are not $5, but $2.50 :-)  They're using some quite
agressive glue to put the plastic colors on the faces. The color sceme
is weird (White <-> Red, Green <-> Yellow, Blue <-> Orange, White, Green
and Yellow are clockwise). When I bought it, two cubelets were glued
together! Also, there are traces of the glue everywhere.

The machanism is not too well, but it doesn't fall apart easily. The
spring loaded mechanism is quite strong! When I took it apart, the springs
pulled the centre pieces together quite a bit.

I think that after some time, it may turn quite well. It will never be
a professional cube, however...

On a side note, my gf claims she saw these cubes at Intertoys or Toys-R-Us
for about $1.50...

As far as I could tell, these are manufactured somewhere in Europe. I could
buy lots and send them to someone willing to re-ship them locally (as in:
In the States). I know the moderator usually doesn't approve of scemes like
this, but if people _really_ want one, it's the only way... Shipping is
_way_ over $1.50 apiece.

If people really want one, let me know, and also if you'd be willing to
re-ship from the USA (to someone else there).
