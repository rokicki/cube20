Subject: RE: (5x5x5) edge parity corrections
Date: Fri, 4 Dec 1998 12:44:07 -0500

The parity problem can be solved on a 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 by using the
following move (can be pasted into puzzler's move macro):

r2D2l1D2l1D1l3r3d2l1r1D3l3r3d2B2r1B2l3B2l1B2r2

For the 4x4x4, this is all that is needed, but for the 5x5x5, two
crosses (centre edges) are swapped.  So you'll need to use the following
to solve the crosses:

First, get the crosses across from each other with:

F2l3F2e1l2e3l2F2l1F2

Now swap the opposite crosses with:

R2e1l2e3l2R2e1l2e3l2

Parity problem solved...

If anyone has a better solution to this rather long one, let me know,
I'm sure some moves could be shaved off.
