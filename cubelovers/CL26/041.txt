Uwe Meffert had a printed color catalogue around 1985 that showed some
very interesting moving-piece "group theory" puzzles (is that a proper
term?). Although I have a copy safely stashed somewhere, I don't know
where.

I'm just about sure that one was a cylinder, possibly in three layers
like layer cake; it also, iirc, had maybe three more "cutting planes"
that were spherical sectors bounded by the cylinder. Rotating the pieces
would exchange top and bottom.
