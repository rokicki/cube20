Subject: Query on Octagon Cube Edge Parity Problem
To: Cube Lovers <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

Hi,

I ran into an unusual scenario with the Octagon cube recently where
only ONE edge piece was flipped and all the other pieces were
positioned and oriented properly. This is bizarre of course, because
with a Rubik's cube, this is an impossible scenario; there must be a
minimum of TWO edge pieces flipped.

Does anyone understand the redundancy that allows this strange edge
parity problem?  And I guess, how to solve it.  I lamely mixed the
cube up again, resolved until the problem "went away".

For those who may not be familiar, the Octagon cube is a variant of
the Rubik's Cube. The cube is organized by color into 8 columns of
three cublets: corner, edge, corner. If you look at the top face you
see that the half of the corner cublets have been cut away so the the
face forms an octagon instead of a square. This octagon shape is
extended down through the middle and bottom layer, so that the puzzle
looks like an octagon "tube". There are a total of 10 colors, two for
the top and bottom faces, and 8 for the eight columns of
(top-middle-bottom) cublets.
