W/Y, B/G, R/O is the "differ by yellow" standard, which I prefer as
"the" standard.  However, there are also references in Cube-Lovers
archives to W/B, R/O, and Y/G as a standard or as the tournament
standard.  I have no idea who gets to be the standards body to select
"the" standard.

But as one example of why I like the W/Y, B/G, R/O standard, many of
the local maxima at 12q from Start are only "somewhat symmetric", but
the eye's sense of symmetry in looking at them can be much stronger.
The reason is that the eye (or my eye, at least) can easily identify
W/Y as the "same" color, B/G as the "same" color, and R/O as the
"same" color.  And when such identifications are made, the symmetry
of many of the 12q local maxima is much stronger than it would be
otherwise.  I really haven't looked at them with any other color
scheme, but I can't imagine that the apparent symmetry would look as
strong otherwise.

Also, in all the various discussions about stickers, falling off and
otherwise, there have been comments about cubes where it is hard to
tell the colors apart, depending on the exact colors which are used,
how faded the colors are with age, etc.  I guess my experience has
been pretty positive in that my stickers have not fallen off and with
one notable exception, the colors seem easy to distinguish.  The
exception is that with my 2x2x2 Pocket Cube, it is very difficult to
distinguish the orange from the red stickers unless I have very, very
good lighting conditions.  This particular cube has always been this
way.  I can think of no reason that a 2x2x2 should be this way as
compared to a 3x3x3 or a 4x4x4, but it does seem to be the case.
