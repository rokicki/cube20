Also, a store in The Netherlands sells these! Last time I was there
(last saturday), they had;
- a couple of 3^3's
- a couple of 5^3's
- skewb

I can't recall if they had a Megaminx at that time.

The store is based in Eindhoven. If anybody wants some, I can buy
them and send them out.

5^3 costs F. 50 (about $25). 3^3 costs F. 10 (about $5).

Before anybody gets this wrong:
- I do not work for them, I'm a happy customer
- I don't get paid to do this
- I make no money out of this

You can call them at: +31-40-2461376

Business hours are 0900 to 1800. The Netherlands is at CET
(differs +6 hours with NY, +9 with CA)
