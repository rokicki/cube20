Bonjour les fous du cube

Honestly, I think I am an unrecognized champion. I CAN solve the cube 
within 5 minutes or more, especially when I throw it through the window 
into the garden (my dog loves cubes, too).
If somebody can do worse, please tell me !
I didn't make up a method to solve 3*3*3, nor 4*4*4.
My cube (my only 3*3*3) is a poor clone of the 80's ; it creaks and get 
jammed but it still works !
I'm a poor lonesome cubist...
My wife and my children are not interested in cubes; shall I sacrifice my 
family to a plastic coloured God ?
"Il faut savoir raison garder !"
After all, I should be very interested in a new fabrication of 4*4*4, 
because mine is broken.
