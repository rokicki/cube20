Subject: RE: Stickers Re: Oddzon version of the cube

	Cubes with tiles instead of stickers came out very early on.  I recall
one called Gyro Cube, which I think was Korean, about 1981?.  Then Ideal took
on the idea as the Deluxe Cube.  I've got an example made in China (real PRC,
not Taiwan, and for the Chinese market).  Recently, I've bought an example at a
newsagent's in London for somewhere in the #1 to #2 range and it worked
moderately well (the previous two which I bought recently were virtually
immovable!).  A large version of this (about 90mm or 3 1/2 in on an edge) was
on sale from a street vendor in December, but I don't know if he has any left
and I haven't seen it elsewhere.
