I have completed a run out to 11q (took a long time).
Regrettably, the diameter proved to be greater than 11q.  I
now have a run in progress out to 12q.  It's going *very*
slowly.  The problem I described where my method is
inefficient calculating the tail of the distribution is
even worse for the quarter turn metric than for the face
turn metric for this particular problem.  Also, to
calculate to 11q or 12q I have to store all the positions
out to 6q, which I can do.  I don't think I can store out
to 7q on the computer I have.  Even if I could, a run to
13q or 14q would be too slow, I think.

I know from parity considerations that the diameter is
greater than 12q, so in some ways my run to 12q is a fool's
errand.  That is, there are less than 12!/2 odd positions
through 11q, so there must be at least a few at 13q.  My
only hope is that all the even positions will show up by
the time I get to 12q.  If so, I would know that the rest
of the odd ones must be at 13q.  Otherwise, I am doomed for
now.

I have an idea of how to approach the inefficiency in the
tail.  Since I am calculating ends-with for each position I
calculate, I know for sure for each position I calculate
which quarter-turns go further from Start and which go
closer.  The idea is that once I get to the tail of the
distribution, I once again begin storing calculated
positions in memory (those which are at the maximal
distance which I am able to calculate).  From there, I
continue further from Start in a more traditional fashion,
leaping one level at a time rather than many levels at a
time.  This works because I have knowledge of which quarter
turns go closer to Start, and hence I don't have to worry
about comparing against those positions closer to
Start which I am not able to store.  If I had time to put
this plan into action, the run time for the tail of the
distribution should be only a few minutes or a few seconds.
