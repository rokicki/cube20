i think it's not good business strategy to attack the people who
are the biggest fans of their product!  to claim ownership of
"the distinctive overall appearance of the RUBIK'S CUBE puzzle"
is ludicrous!

the changes you've described to your web page seem quite
reasonable and appropriate (given the circumstances), without
compromising too much.  i hope you have no further trouble with
seven towns.  but if you do, please let me know about it.

to make this situation even more ridiculous, i just checked out
their "official" website, which features a java cube
(http://rubiks.com/VRCUBE.html).  their applet is stolen
from karl ho"rnell!  (http://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl/java/rubik.html)
