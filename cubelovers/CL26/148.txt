Subject: RE: Fwd: Request for spectacular cube-solving  -  Can anyone  help ?

	Yes there were ordinary cubes made with markings fo the blind.  Rainier
Seitz, product manager fro Arxon, the German distributor, made the first
examples by heating a needle and making dice-like marking of one to six spots.
Several versions were made commercially or by specialist firms.  I have
examples with zero to five spots in this style, alos with brass studs of five
sizes and then Ideal (perhaps only Arxon) produced a version with moulded
plastic facelets having symbols on them: +, -, hollow circle, square, triangle
and solid circle.  Meffert made pyramids with four different textures of
surface  I asked a blind friend if they were easyily distinguished and he said
yes.
