Subject: Mustering Interest in the Rubik's Cube

Hi-

I've been a cubist since elementary school in 1980.  My interest increases
and decreases in waves, however, it never dies.  I'm now back in school at
Virginia Tech as a computer science major.  Does anyone have any
suggestions on how to muster serious  interest with some of my peers at the
University?

Thank you,

Kevin Young
