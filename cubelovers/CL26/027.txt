        My page at http://www.unc.edu/~monroem/rubik.html describes a
method that is sort of "corners first".  Although, in my first step I say
to solve the first layer before going on, one could effectively simply
place only the four corners in the top layer, then move on to the four
corners in the bottom layer (specified in steps 2 and 3), then begin
filling in the gaps on the top and bottom layers (steps 4 and 5), and
lastly finish the middle layer.

        In fact, a chemistry professor at my current school, Holden Thorp,
competed in one of the Rubik's cube playoff contests that was aired on the
TV show That's Incredible.  Someone posted the video of it about a month
ago (and mentioned it in this discussion list), and he saw it here at my
school after I downloaded it.  He then looked at my page and mentioned
that the winner of the contest actually used the solution shown on my page
(probably modified slightly).  I can only solve a well-scrambled cube in 2
to 3 minutes using the solution, but I'm sure someone quite adept, nimble,
and fast could push it to under one minute.  (Please note this isn't "my"
solution; I simply learned it from a book many years ago.  Further, I have
never been in a cube solving competition).
