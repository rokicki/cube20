To: Cube Lovers <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

Hi,

This may be inappropriate for this list, but I thought a few cube
lovers may be interested in this.

I was talking to my college buddy the other day, and he was telling me
about a curious habit of his mom's of buying x-mas gifts and not
giving them away.  Instead, the gifts were stowed away in one of their
closets like museum pieces.  One of these "pieces" is a Rubik's cube.

Hmm... Now I became interested. I asked him about it.. he thought it
wasn't worth much, the packaging was pristine, looked new.  I asked
him to look carefully at the packaging.  The manufacturer was Ideal,
and it has a "1980" and a "Made in Hungary" stamped on it.  (i.e. an
Original Rubik's Cube, untouched in it's original packaging for almost
two decades). I told him it was probably worth more than he thinks.

Just curious.  Does anyone know how much this little gem is worth?

[Moderator's note: For the past few years there have been rumors
 flying around the net, and perhaps the news services, about thousands
 of dollars being paid for vintage unopened cubes, either the Ideal
 "Rubik's cubes", or the earlier "Hungarian Magic Cube".  Some of
 these rumors may even be true.  However, I feel I should warn people
 against careless speculation, since the Internet is prone to fraud of
 various forms. ]
