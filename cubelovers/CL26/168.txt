Here's a set of explicit processes:  a lower-case letter means a turn
of the layer containing the wing piece next to the outer layer denoted
by the corresponding capital letter, and in the same sense.  The
brackets show the movement of the pieces in the upper layer.

l F' L F l' F' L' F          (Bl, lF, Lf)

F2 r2 D R2 D' r2 D R2 D' F2  (Br, Fl, Rf)

r' U b U' F2 U b' U' F2 r    (Bl, lF, Fr)

R2 U2 l D' l' U2 l D l' R2   (Br, Fl, bR)

b L2 D l D' L2 D l' D' b'    (Lb, Fl, fL)

l2 U2 r' l U2 l' U2 l U2 r l U2 r' U2 l U2 r l2 U2  (Fl, rF)

The final sequence swaps a pair of pieces in the front face.  There's
been a lot of discussion of this move in Cube-lovers over the years.
The process I've quoted changes pieces in the central nine on the back
face, but nothing will show if all the cube except the top layer is
solved.  The other processes change no other pieces.
