I've never solved mine for speed, because I'm afraid of more
stickers falling off (already 3 are missing and I have to "deduce"
what they are).  10 minutes sounds reasonable -- I'm not sure I've
ever resorted to formulas written on paper.   (For one thing, I'm
not sure I know of any notation!)

This brings up, actually, a rather embarrasing point for me as a puzzle
solver.  At first I had no idea how to generalize the standard cube moves
I used to the Megaminx.  So, eventually I figured out a new method,
which was:
  1.  Solve a large chunk of it by normal moves, perhaps leaving
    only three faces unsolved;
  2.  Solve the edges of the remaining faces (if you can solve an
    Alexander's Star, you can do this);
  3.  Solve the corners.

I found this quite effective.

About a year later, when my Megaminx was in storage and I was
playing with the Cube, I suddenly realized that my method for the
Megaminx would work perfectly well for the Cube!  (O, for that
matter, anything with a similar structure of "corners" with three
faces and "edges" with two faces.) I chastized myself
heavily for not realizing this "obvious generalization", and
with it was able to work out more moves for the Cube.
