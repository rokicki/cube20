I had the same 'problem' a couple of months ago.

A handheld computer users group I was active in, once published a
program that could be described as 'well, it looks a bit like Tetris
((R), if those lawyers are reading this, as well :-), but it's a long
way off the mark'.

The program was published in our magazine, and was also placed on a
web-page.

A couple of months ago, I received a letter from a Belgian lawyer firm,
addressed to the user's group. This user's group, by the way, died about
5 years (!) ago.

They told us to 'cease and decist' (a couple of things), including publishing
this article on 'our web-page'. Well, since this was someone else's web-
page, there was nothing we could do about it.

We told them (in friendly terms) that the user's group no longer existed,
that we were not affiliated to the user having the article on his web-page,
and that we nover sold the program.

We haven't heard from them (not even a letter stating that they received our
reply!) since.

It's kinda sad: The program was for an HP28S. I would have _loved_ to see
those lawyers type the program in (a couple of kilobytes, via the keyboard!),
only to find out that it was 'almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Tetris'
(Douglas, if you're reading this, quotes are ok, no?).

Just tell them you will take down the name, and they will probably be
off your back.
