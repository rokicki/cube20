I didn't notice it originally, but this position is in the slice
subgroup, and is only one slice move from Pons.  Half turns such
as L2 can be written equally well as either LL or as L'L',
so we can write (L2 R2) as (L'R)(L'R) and (D2 U2) as (D'U)(D'U).
Thus, the weak local maximum 6f from Start can be written as five
slices, one slice short of Pons.

L'R  L'R  D'U  D'U  B'F

All we would have to do to get the Pons would be to add one more
B'F slice.
