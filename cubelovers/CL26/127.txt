Subject: Megaminx solving times?

Hi,

I've been practising the Megaminx, and I can now solve it
without resorting to formulas written down on paper. I can
do it in about 10 minutes. How does this compare to other
people's times?

And, what method do you use? The method I developed relies
heavily upon the standard cube moves, and I solve the Mega-
minx going down from one flat top in rings. I needed to
adapt 1 (one!) standard cube formula to get it to work on
the Megaminx.
