I too have seen many of  these cubes w/ plastic tiles.  I have many
different brands including the "Old Brand Magic Cube".  I find them at
swap meets.  Most sell for $2, but I recently found a vendor who sells
'em for ONLY $1!  I immediately bought 5 on the spot.  The next time I
go down there, I think I'll buy out the shop's stock of cubes.  Either
that, or ask how to get them myself.

The quality is pretty bad.  The turning is pretty sticky, but w/ some
lube and a little wear and tear, it's alright.  Plus, they break apart
pretty easily.  When they're really worn out, cubies start popping out
all the time.  If you use WD-40, it'll eat away at the plastic resulting
in really smooth turning.  It'll be great for about 3-4 weeks of daily
cubing, but the WD-40 will take its toll, and the cube will start
falling apart.  But for a few bucks every 3-4 weeks is worth it to me.

The good thing about these is that you can make your own "deluxe" cube.
First, with a little bit of effort, and a good razor blade, you can pry
off the plastic tiles.  Next, strip off all the stickers (If they
haven't already fallen off by themselves) and wipe off the sticky residue
on your smoothest, sturdiest cube.  Then, super glue the tiles in any
color arrangement you want!  (the tiles come in the standard colors)
The tiles may have a slightly rough surface after you pry them off, so
you might have to strip off any scarring/hardened glue w/ a razor to
make sure it's nice and flat when glued down.

This process isn't easy.  It took me hours.  But in the end, it's all
worth it.  I've only done one so far, but it works so well, I don't need
to do another one yet.  I've been cubing daily, hours at a time for
about two months with the same cube.
