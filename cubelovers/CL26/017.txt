Subject: comments on "davenport's pattern"

David Singmaster claims to have discovered this pattern in 1979 or
1980, so it should be credited to him. In my own book I present a
number of patterns, but I would never dare to claim authorship to any
of them. Singmaster's comments prompted me to look at my own books. In
CUBE GAMES (Taylor and Rylands} this pattern appears on the top of page
37.I have a strong suspicion this pattern could be a combination of the
two cyclicity-three patterns on page 36 therein. One may use this
pattern as a corner in a 3-color design.

Design-construction is a step beyond pattern-construction. My question
has not yet been satisfactorily answered. Has anyone seen construction
of 3-dimensional "sculpture-like" designs? People referred me to
Davenport's creations, but my own designs are quite different.
