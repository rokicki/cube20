Hey! _I'm_ already teaching my blind friend how to solve a cube!
We marked the colors of the cube with braille letters spelling
1 - 6 dots. We're having a terribly hard time to teach him to solve
it. It's fun, though...


Would a team of 3-4 blind people competing to solve the cube be
considered 'spectacular'? I think juggling is too hard. I'll ask
my gf, though (she knows how to juggle a bit, _and_ how to solve
the cube).
