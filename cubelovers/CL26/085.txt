In the mechanism I know for a 2X2X2 Cube, at its center is a piece like
a jack, that is, one of the pieces in the traditional game, but without
the knobs at the ends. You could also think of it as three rods
intersecting at a common point, and mutually orthogonal; it's as if you
had plus and minus x, y, and z axes defined by the directions of the
rods. These create the axes of revolution for one half relative to the
other.

The cubies are hollow, and their mating faces have curved cutaways. To
keep the cubies from moving too far from each other, 12 "clips" extend
from the center outward. If you think of a deeply-grooved pulley, cut
pie-style into quarters, you have a general idea. The curved-cutout
edges of the cubies fit between two curved, parallel sides of the
"clips".

Finally, the "clips" are kept engaged with the cubies either directly by
square cross-section extensions of the center "jack", or by hollow
square rods that pivot on (smaller) cylindrical extensions. Just as the
ball in a 4^3 is locked to one half, the "jack" is, also.

The big problem with this mechanism is that unless the parts can deform
sufficiently without breaking (the actual case; they can do so), it's
impossible to assemble or to disassemble as molded. If it were made of
metal, it couldn't be assembled without design changes.

Illustrations are really needed here; this mechanism is a challenge to
describe understandably!

I'd think that the internal ball uses a variant of the tongue and groove
scheme, if it's like the 4^3.
