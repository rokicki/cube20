THE CUBES THAT YOU REFER TO ARE NOT MINE BUT A CHEAP COPY OUT OF CHINA.

Different textured labels including tile labels should be easily purchasable
from a good stationary store and you can easily up a few samples by hand.

About 12 years ago I made 50k pieces of my Pyraminx with 4 different texture
material for the Blind which I donated to several Blind Intitutes around the
world and I understand that some of the players where able to solve the
pyraminx by themselves without any help.

Produceable yes marketable NO.

All the self adhesive labels are glued on by hand one side at a
time using a sort of special scotch tape with its adhesive
properties being lower then the adhesive on the labels.

Thats because the cubes are from a small copy company that does
not care about quality

CONGRATULATIONS
