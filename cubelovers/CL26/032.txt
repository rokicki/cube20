Maybe (although I don't think so since some people
already answered what I was asking) I made a mistake
when describing the position I wanted to accomplish.
What I wanted was:
      L B R
      L B R
      L B R
F F F T T T F F F D D D
L L L T T T R R R D D D
B B B T T T B B B D D D
      L F R
      L F R
      L F R

And until now the best solution is:
F B L F2 T D- L2 B- T- D- F2 R- T- D L- R D
