Hi,

Okay, another so what, big deal.  I finally solved the Professor's
Cube. For those who may not be familiar, the Professor's Cube is a
5x5x5 Rubik's cube. Whew that was hard.  It took me a good 4 days to
figure out all the moves.  Gees, it made the Megaminx seem like
child's play in comparison.  Once again, Noel Dillabough's Puzzler
program was an invaluable tool to visualize and experiment with
various moves.  Thanks Noel!

For those brave souls who would like to conquer this beast, the
following solution may provide some enlightenment.  It's a layers
solution, in contrast to the corners-first solution that I have seen
posted on various web sites. Good luck to you.  The Professor's Cube
is a truly challenging puzzle.
______________________________________________________
Method for Solving the Professor's Cube (5x5x5)

I will use Noel Dillabough's system for referring to various slices or
layers, as described in his Puzzler's F1 help.
________________________________________
Notation:

U - The upper slice
u - One slice away from the upper slice
e - The equator slice
d - One slice away from the lower slice
D - The lower slice

L - The leftmost slice
l - One slice away from the leftmost slice
m - The middle slice
r - One slice away from the rightmost slice
R - The rightmost slice

F - The facing slice
f - Once slice away from the facing slice
M - The facing middle slice
b - One slice away from the back face
B - The back slice

I will use the words "slice" and "layer" synonymously. A "face" is one
of the six outer slices; namely, U, D, L, R, F or B.  Rotations of the
middle slices e, m or M will be in the same direction as the U, R and
F faces, respectively.

Let y denote one of the slices.
y - represents a clockwise 1/4 turn of the y-slice
y' - represents a counterclockwise 1/4 turn of the y-slice
y2 - represents a clockwise 1/2 turn of the y-slice
(For example, Rrm represents clockwise 1/4 turns using the RIGHT-hand
of the R, r and m slices.  Ll represents clockwise 1/4 turns using the
LEFT-hand of the L and l slices.)

Finally, let's consider the pieces or cubelets on any given face.
There are four types of cubelets: corners, edges, centrals and a
center.  For a given face, there are 4 corners, 12 edges, 8 centrals
and 1 center.  With these four types and the intersection of any two
slices using Dillabough's notation, we can specify the location of any
cubelet.  For example, consider the F-face:

LU-corner: the corner cubelet on the upper left-hand corner of the
F-face
re-central: the central cubelet adjacent and to the right of the
center cubelet of the F-face
_______________________________________
First Layer (U slice):

Solving the first layer is fairly straightforward.  Basically the same
as solving the Rubik's cube.  The central pieces are the only thing
really different.
_______________________________________
Second Layer (u slice):

1. First, solve for the mid-central pieces (F-face mu, B-face mu,
L-face Mu, R-face Mu).  Get one of the mid-central piece on the same
color face, and then rotate it into position by using the "free lane"
from the opposite face.  For example, let's say we want have a
mid-central piece at the re position of the F-face.  Use the D-"free
lane" of the B face to position the mid-central piece without
affecting your newly completed U slice, by moving: B2 U2 F' U2 B2.

2. Now, solve for the left and right central pieces (F-face lu, ru,
L-face bu, fu, etc).  Here's where we'll use a genuinely new move.
Position one of the left/right central pieces on the D-face so that it
and the position you want to move the cubelet into lie in the save
vertical slice.  For example, let's say we want to move the left
central cubelet into the F-face lu position.  Position the left
central cubelet at the D-face lb position and perform the following
u-layer DF Swing move:

>From the D-face lb position: l d' l' d' l d2 l'

See how that works?  The corresponding move at the D-face rb position
is:

>From the D-face rb position: r' d r d r' d2 r

This same concept is used to move the left/right central pieces into
position for both the Second (u-slice) and Fourth (d-slice) layers.

"Hey, what if my left/right central piece is on the F face? How do I
move the piece to the D face so that I can apply this move?"  Good
question.  Position the piece on the F-face ld or rd position and
apply the corresponding move described above.  That should move the
cubelet to the D face where you can then apply the move again to move
it into the correct left/right central position.

3. Finally, solve for the left and right edges (F-face and B-face Lu,
Ru).  Use the classic Rubik's cube move to rotate an D-edge piece into
one of the middle layer edge positions.  Namely, if the cubelet is at
the F-face rD or lD position and the destination position is F-face Ru
or Lu then perform the following:

F-Edge Swing Moves:
Destination position F-face Ru: D' R' D R F' R F R'
Destination position F-face Lu: D L D' L' F L' F' L
_______________________________________
Third Layer (e slice):

1. Solve for the left/right central pieces (F-face le, re, L-face be,
fe, etc).  You'll notice that the DF Swing moves will not work here.
Darn.  Instead, we'll use the F-Edge Swing move adapted for the l and
r slices.  Position the cubelet at the F-face md position then perform
the following:

F-Central Swing Moves:
Destination position F-face Re: d'r'dD rR f'F' r fF r'R'
Destination position F-face Le: d l d'D' l'L' fF l' f'F' lL

"Hey,  what if my left/right central piece is on the D face? How do I
move the piece to the F face so that I can apply this move?"  Same
problem.  Position the cubelet at the D-face rM position then apply
the Re F-Central Swing move.

2. Solve for the left and right edges (F-face and B-face Le, Re).
Again, a slight variation of the F-Edge Swing move will do.  Position
the edge piece on the F-face mD position and perform the following:

e-Layer F-edge Swing Moves:
Destination position F-face Re: D' R' D rR F' R F r'R'
Destination position F-face Le: D L D' L'l' F L' F' Ll
______________________________________
Fourth Layer (d slice):

1. First, solve for the mid-central pieces (F-face md, B-face md,
L-face Md, R-face Md). This is one of the most difficult steps.  The
mid-central pieces will be on either the d-slice or on the D-face. To
move them into there correct positions, you'll need to use a few
modified Rubik's cube moves:

Place the D-face as the U-face when applying these moves:

The following sets of cubelets are affected by these moves:
cL = (central L-face Lu, edge U-face LM and central U-face lM)
cR = (central R-face Ru, edge U-face RM and central U-face rM)
cF = (central F-face mu, edge U-face mF and central U-face mf)

Mid-central Tricycle:
move: T2(U) = F2 f2 Uu Ll r'R' F2 f2 L'l' rR Uu F2 f2
action: Permutes the three sets of cubelets (cL, cR, cF) clockwise:

Mid-central Bi-Flip Tricycle:
move:  S2(B) = L'l' rR bB Ll r'R' U2u2 L'l' rR Bb Ll r'R'
action: Permutes the three sets of cubelets (cL, cR, cF) clockwise and
flips the cR and cF sets.  Let's clarify "flipping".  Let's say for
the cR set you have the colors: blue, (blue, yellow), yellow
corresponding to the three cubelets. After flipping the cR set you'll
have the colors: yellow, (yellow, blue), blue.

Use these two moves to position all the mid-central pieces for the
Fourth Layer.  Now, if you're lucky, and Murphy's Law says that you
will be, you may end up in a configuration where you'll have three of
the mid-central pieces positioned properly, but the fourth mid-central
position will be on the D-face.  Okay, now we're going to start having
fun.  Position the central cubelet at the D-face lM position (i.e. on
the left-hand side).  Place the D-face as the U-face and then apply
the following sequence of moves:

S2(B) T2(U') U2 T2(U) S2(B') U' S2(B')

Yes, all that trouble just to move one mid-central cubelet from the
U-face to the F-face.

2. Whew, congratulate yourself if you've made it this far.  Now, solve
for the left/right central cubelets, (F-face ld, rd, L-face bd, fd,
etc).

Position the left central cubelet at the D-face lf or rf position and
perform the following d-layer DF Swing move:

>From the D-face lf position: l d l' d l d2 l'
>From the D-face rf position: r' d' r d' r' d2 r

3. Solve for the left and right edges (F-face and B-face Ld, Rd).
Again, a slight variation of the F-Edge Swing move will do.  Position
the edge piece on the F-face lD or rD position and perform the
following:

d-Layer F-edge Swing Moves:
Destination position F-face Rd: D' R' D mrR F' R F m'r'R'
Destination position F-face Ld: D L D' L'l'm F L' F' Llm'
______________________________________
Fifth Layer (D slice):

1. Solve for the corner cubelets using standard Rubik's cube moves.
First, position the corners in their correct locations using the usual
corner swappers:

Adjacent corners swap: R' D' R F D F' R' D R D2
Diagonal corners swap: R' D' R F D2 F' R' D R D

And then rotate or twist the corners in position using Sune's move:

Sune's 3-corner twister: : R' D' R D' R' D2 R D2

2. Solve for the mid-edges (mF, RM, mB, LM) using a slight
modification to the Tricycle moves.

Place the D-face as the U-face when applying these moves:

Mid-edge Tricycle:
move: F2 U Ll r'R' F2 L'l' rR U F2
action: Permutes the three edges (LM, RM, mF) clockwise:

Mid-edge Bi-Flip Tricycle:
move: L'l' rR B Ll r'R' U2 L'l' rR B Ll r'R'
action: Permutes the three edges (LM, RM, mF) clockwise and flips the
RM and mF.

3. Solve for the left/right edges (lF,rF, Rf, Rb, lB, rB, Lf, Lb).
Now, we're going to have some serious fun. The hardest part of this
step is not getting lost while performing the long sequence of moves.
Also while spinning all these slices, another difficulty is preventing
the cube from exploding and keeping the central pieces from twisting
around.

Again, place the D-face as the U-face with applying these collection
of moves:

LR-edge Tricycle:
move: F2 U Lm'R' F2 L'mR U F2
action: Permutes the three pairs of edges ((Lf,Lb), (Rf,Rb), (lF,rF))
clockwise:

LR-edge Bi-Flip Tricycle:
move: L'mR B Lm'R' U2 L'mR B Lm'R'
action: Permutes the three pairs of edges ((Lf,Lb), (Rf,Rb), (lF,rF))
clockwise and flips the Rf, Rb, lF and rF.

To get those last remaining cubelets in place, a few more exotic moves
are necessary:

Definitions:
T(x) = F2 U x F2 x' U F2
x1 = L r' R'
x2 = L l R'
x3 = L m' R'
(T(x) is a generalized form of the Mid-edge Tricycle)

X1 = T(x1) T(x1) T(x1)
X2 = T(x2) T(x2) T(x2)
X3 = T(x3)

Name: Double pair F swap
Description: Swap two pairs of edges: (lF - Lb)  and (rF - Rb)
Move: X2 X1

Move: X2 X1 X3

Name: Double pair R cross swap
Decription: Swap two pairs of edges:  (Rb - rF) and (Rf - Lb)
Move: X1 X2 X3

Move: X3 X2 X1

Name: Double pair L cross swap

Move: X3 X1 X2

Name: LRL-edge Bi-Flip Tricycle
Description: Permutes (lF, Lf, Rf) edges clockwise and flip lF and Lf
edges
Move: X3 X1

Name: LLR-edge Bi-Flip Tricycle
Description: Permutes (lF, Lb, Rb) edges clockwise and flip Lb and Rb
edges
Move: X1 X3

edges
Move: X2 X3

Name: RLR-edge Bi-Flip Tricycle
Description: Permutes (rF, Lb, Rb) edges clockwise and flip rF and Lb
edges
Move: X3 X2

With these collection of moves, you should be able to finish off the
Professor's Cube!   *Sigh*

P.S. Thanks "Professor" Meffert.  For those folks like myself who have
wrestled and completed your 5x5x5 cube, we can only ask and plead,
"What's Next?!!"  :)
