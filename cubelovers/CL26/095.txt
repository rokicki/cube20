 I would like to voice my concern over this site.  The thing is that not
 everyone has the latest version of Netscape or IE installed.  Many
 libraries (from which I myself access the WWW) do not allow Java to be
 installed on their machines nor do they allow sound.  The highest browser
 versions I have access to in any library here in Milwaukee is 3.0
 I had gone to this site and I could not play the puzzle that was supposed
 to be there; nothing showed up on the screen. 

 I just wished to point this out to the creator of the site; in fact, to
 all creators of puzzle sites.  There are, I believe, a significant number
 of people who use public browsers without Java or sound.  Please keep this
 in mind when designing your sites.  Thank you.

[Moderator's note: Cube-lovers is not really the place to debate the
 philosophy of web design.  I must agree that for maximum usability,
 the text on a page should be displayed without requiring images, and
 that the static images should be displayed with requiring Java.
 Still, setting up a puzzle simulator without Java is more problematic
 than we can reasonably ask of a free server, and having a simulation
 that requires Java is certainly better than none. --Dan ]
