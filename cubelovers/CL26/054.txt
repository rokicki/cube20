Yes, it does occur equally on the 4-Cube.  Though I have never seen
one, I feel certain that similar parity problems will occur on all
higher-order Cubes as well, though above order 5 there will be multiple
distinct types of "wings", each of which will have its own comparable
potential problem.

Note that the problem goes away entirely if cube faces are marked such
that symmetrically placed face cubies are not visually
indistinguishable, because the parity problem in question always occurs
in conjunction with a similar parity problem on face cubies, but the
latter is invisible on most cubes.

Most briefly, how I do it is to make a single quarter-turn of a slice
containing one of the wing pieces involved, then fix up the damage by
moving wings back into place using commutators rather than slice moves.
