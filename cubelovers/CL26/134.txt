How difficult is it to read braille when the characters are in arbitrary
orientations?  Have you thought of using some other coding technique that
might prove more easy to distinguish in any orientation?  (Any idea what
that might be?)

[Moderator's note: I'm inordinately proud of my own invention, which I
thought I mentioned years ago but can't find in the archives: Wire
symbols glued to a destickered cube, polished to a high gloss.  The
symbols are blank opposite dot, square opposite circle, and plus
opposite X.  The supergroup is marked by a cutout at a corner of each
face center and the adjacent cubies.  I can solve it behind my back,
but when I lent it to a blind computer scientist, he gave up. --Dan]
