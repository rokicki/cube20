I also own such a puzzle, although I have never seen one in 
a store.  I got mine at a garage sale for $0.25.

I haven't played with it in a long time.  But my best
recollection is that it can be solved basically the same
way as a 3x3x3 cube, except that *I think* (don't remember
for sure) that the color scheme permits invisible swaps of
identically colored pieces which can make the puzzle seem
"impossible" to solve unless you realize that the
identically colored pieces must be swapped.  It is also my
best recollection that such a puzzle is mentioned briefly
and is pictured in one of Douglas Hofstadters's cube
articles in Scientific American back in the early 80's.  So
I don't think it is any kind of new invention.
