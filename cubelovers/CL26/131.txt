I am currently trying to learn how to do it without looking.  Have a long
ways to go.  I use to be able to do it, watching the cube of course,  in
less than a minute.  After 17 years and not being a school age boy anymore,
and forgetting some of my tricks, I can still do it everytime in approx. 90
seconds.  Long ways away from being a world champion.  But, currently I'm
working on the no looking thing.  Right now, I can put two pieces at a time
in their appropriate position, behind my back, however, after those pieces
are set, I have to look.  Good luck to all that are trying to learn how to
do it blindfolded.

Regards,

Kevin Young
