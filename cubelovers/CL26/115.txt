Subject: Puzzle Stores in London area

I'll be going to the london/cambrige area in a few days and was wondering
if anyone knew where there are any puzzle stores that have cube puzzles.
I'm not really looking for 3x3x3 cubes since I have enough, mainly I'm
looking for the other ones like pyrimix, megamix etc.  thanx in advance.
