Your recollection is not exact.  There are no identically colored
pieces to swap, but you can swap complete columns consisting of two
"corners" (what would have been corners on the cube) and one "edge"
without noticing.

In fact, if you create an even permutation of those columns, there is
no problem.  But if you create an odd permutation, it will become
impossible to solve the upper layer.

Presuming you solve cubes in layers, the easiest way out is to not
start at one of the octagonal layers (which seems the most natural
way), but to start with a "side" layer.  If you do it this way, it
will always be possible to solve the last layer.

I hope I'm making myself at least somewhat clear,
Bas.
