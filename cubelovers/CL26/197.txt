I think that if we are to be keeping track records & averages, we should
ALL stick to one standard.  Using tournament rules sounds like a good
idea.  This makes comparing times more accurate.

Almost everybody responded w/ a different preview time (anywhere from no
preview to 15 seconds).  People like me who started cold had a
disadvantage to those who had a preview.  A 15 second preview sounds
good to me.  This gives enough time to familiarize oneself w/ the cube,
look for pieces, and plan out the first few moves.  I've been timing
myself cold which means much time is wasted at the beginning.  Having a
preview helps a lot.

When it comes to averages, I guess there is no standard.  I agree w/
disregarding the high & low extremes though.  They can distort the
average (arithmetic mean).  This should give a more accurate
representation.  Also, the more entries calculated into the average the
better.

I hope I'm not going overboard.  It's not like we're in a tournament.
If all that is necessary is an informal rough estimate, then you can
disregard this entire message. =)
