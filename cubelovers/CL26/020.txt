Subject: Unauthorized Use of RUBIK'S CUBE and CUBE Design Marks?

About 2 weeks ago I received the following message and it seems to me
that it might be interesting for you too:

> Dear Mr. Kociemba:
> 
> This firm is intellectual property counsel to Seven Towns Limited ("Seven
> Towns"), the manufacturer and worldwide distributor of the RUBIK'S CUBE three-
> dimensional puzzle and provider of an electronic version of the puzzle via its
> official web site, which is located at http://rubiks.com.
> 
> The RUBIK'S CUBE mark is famous throughout the world.  The distinctive
> overall appearance of the RUBIK'S CUBE puzzle also is a famous trademark owned
> by Seven Towns.  These marks are registered or are the subject of pending
> trademark applications in most of the major countries of the world.
> 
> It has come to our attention that your web site features a program under the
> name of Rubik's Cube Explorer.   I must advise that your unauthorized use of
> the RUBIK'S CUBE mark owned by Seven Towns constitutes trademark infringement.
> Specifically, the use of this mark in designating the origin of your program
> confuses the public into believing mistakenly that it derives from, is
> associated with, or is endorsed or sponsored by the owner of this commercial
> symbol (i.e., Seven Towns).  Moreover, apart from causing consumer confusion,
> your use of the well-known mark dilutes its distinctive value in violation of
> the federal and state anti-dilution laws.
> 
> Seven Towns appreciates your interest in the RUBIK'S CUBE puzzle, and it
> certainly does not wish to inhibit legitimate discussion of the puzzle on the
> Internet or in any other medium.  However, it also must be vigilant in
> maintaining the value and integrity of its intellectual property.  It cannot
> afford to lose control over its commercial reputation, or damage to its
> substantial goodwill, by permitting another party to use its trademarks or
> trade dress in a manner that causes source confusion or otherwise dilutes
> their selling power.  Thus, Seven Towns requests that you remove from your web
> site the electronic version of the RUBIK'S CUBE manipulative puzzle, and that
> you discontinue any further use of the term RUBIK'S CUBE or any similar
> designation in the prominent, source-indicating manner of a trademark.
> 
> I hope that you are understanding of our client's position, and I thank you
> in advance on behalf of Seven Towns for your prompt attention to this matter.
>  
>                                                         Sincerely yours,

Indeed the headline of my homepage at

http://home.t-online.de/home/kociemba/cube.htm

was "Rubik's Cube Explorer 1.5". So I removed the word "Rubik's" and
added some note at the bottom of the page (...blah blah is not derived
from, is not associated with blah blah...).

I definitely will not remove the program from my homepage. This seems
ridiculous. I know, that other cube fans received similar mail because
they have some similar statements on their homepages now.

What do you think about that?
