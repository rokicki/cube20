As far as timing is concerened, do you include a preview before the
timer is started, or is it done "cold" (No looking at all before the
timer starts)?  If a preview is allowed, how long do you get?  Is there
a standard for this that everyone is going by?  For longer times this
shouldn't matter too much, but for record keeping and fast times such as
Jiri's 14 seconds, I can see how a few seconds in the begining can
really make a difference.  Is there a FAQ about this?

Also, are you people timing yourselves or do you have someone to do it?
I do it myself.  It doesn't affect my time too much, but I can shave off
a second or two if someone else does it.
