However, it must be said that they are not suddenly aware of this. This
has been a problem for some time. Frankly, I have a Rubik's original
from 5 years ago with the same propblem. Oddzon don't seem to built the
items or make them in colours that Rubik himself even approves of (take
the new colours of the magic for instance - terrible).

I am currently on the lookout for an asian fake cube because they have
always been (dare I say it) better quality in the sticker dept. My Fake
is 15 years old with all stickers nicely attached.

Come on Oddzon... a cube that wears out in a month?.... I think this is
very clever and deliberate marketing.

Wayne
