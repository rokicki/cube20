I have a decent solution to the 5x5x5 on my web page at
www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake.  I call those cubies "wings"
also, and I foolishly assumed that I invented the term.
Either that, or you have looked at my solution and are
still having trouble.  Please let me know if this page
is helpful or not.  If not, I would be happy to explain
further how I solve the wings.

Indeed, 3x3x3 moves will not help you with the wings.
