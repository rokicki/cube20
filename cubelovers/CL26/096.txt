Heehee!  Had me going there until I saw the signature. :-)

I have had only one experience dealing with Mr. Bandelow.  In that one,
I did indeed find him quick, reliable, fair, and competent.  (I bought
a 5x5x5 and the Cube-family puzzle whose name I forget based on the
dodecahedron, the one that turns based on slices made parallel to the
faces, passing through edge centres.  Interestingly, my experience with
the dodecahedral puzzle taught me enough that I can now solve a
two-face scramble on the 3x3x3 without leaving the two-face subgroup,
which I previously couldn't.)
