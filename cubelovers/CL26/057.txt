Hi Jacob

In both cases (4X and 5X) I solve this problem in the following way:

1] I solve the rest of the cube, leaving me with the two "switched wings"
(in your terminology).

2] I then arrange things so both  "wings" are on the same
"off-center-slice".  (Also it will always be the case that both of these
winds are now on the same face.)

This will be easy to do using the 3-wing swapping operators.

3] At this point I now rotate the "off-center-slice" containing the
"switched wings" by a quarter turn.

As a result of this move it will be the case that that the
"off-center-slice" now has one of the previously "switched wings" in its
"correct cubicle".  The other three "wings" will be now be in a cyclic
permutation.

4] Since --from your note above-- I assume you understand how to cycle
three "wings", all you have to do now is put the "wings" in the right place
and replace the damage to the off-center central faces that were messed up
during that initial quarter-turn above.  (And since they are in "paired"
clusters, this should be pretty straightforward.)

(In short, the quarter-turn of the non-central slice puts the cube back in
the proper "orbit" for finishing up.)


Now clearly this is far from maximal.  And it's certainly not terribly
fast.  But I find it a very simple, and an easy (and easy-to-remember [and
easy-to-explain]) way to clean up this potentially messy situation.

Hope this helps
Nichael
