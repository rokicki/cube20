The <U,R> subgroup has been explored fairly thoroughly.  For
example, look in the archives 8/31/1994 for a summary of the
first complete God's Algorithm search of this particular
subgroup.  There are a number of articles in the archives
thereafter.  <U,R> has been searched in both the quarter turn
metric and the face turn metric, and local maxima have been
investigated as a part of the search.

<U,R> has a very small branching factor and a corresponding
large diameter of 25 in the quarter turn metric, at least I
think it's a large diameter for such a small group. Until Mike
Reid recently showed that the diameter of G in the quarter turn
metric was at least 26, the diameter of <U,R> was the largest
known for the 3x3x3 cube or any of its subgroups.

Frey and Singmaster's book discusses both two face and three
face subgroups, among other things giving their sizes.

To my knowledge, no God's Algorithm searches have been performed
for the three face subgroups.

We have |<U,R>|=73483200, so <U,R> is slightly smaller than the
corners group at 88179840.  The 2x2x2 is 24 times smaller than
the corners group, at 3674160.  However, I am of the school
of thought that tends not to equate the size of the group (or
search space, for problems that are not actually groups) with
the difficulty of the problem.
