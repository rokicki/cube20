Check that, the Korea cube is definitely of poorer quality than either
Macau or Hong Kong yet at the same time has its own merits.  The reason
that the cube felt more like it was going to break was because the
middle "wing" cubelets and corner cubelets are "hollow."  The material
is also softer, but somehow it feels like the corner pieces are sturdier
than the earlier ones made in Macau and Hong Kong.  I am assuming it was
made later because seldom are puzzles made of higher quality in later
runs, especially when the tooling is probably more expensive and when
the print run is so short.  But all 3 versions wear the same "(c) I.T.C.
1982" (Ideal Toy Company?) with the different "Made in..." markings.

Anyway, the puzzle was easily disassembled without the need to remove a
screw (There IS no screw unlike the others).  Just like popping open a
standard cube.  Looser tolerances went into making this piece so this
was not a difficult task.  Like I said, the corner cubelets actually
feel sturdier than the others but the overall the plastic used is much
softer and tolerances aren't tight.  Of course, this makes for an easier
turning puzzle but tends to "stick" a lot because of the hollow pieces.
If these "hollows" were somehow smoothed in, this would be a pleasure to
work on instead of the stiffer (and more break prone) Macau and Hong
Kong cubes.  As it is, the center windows tend to bind easily against
each other and I think ultimately it will break just as easily (if not
more easily) than the Macau or Hong Kong deals.  Oh yeah, the Korea
Revenge also feels slightly lighter than the Macau or Hong Kong cubes
for obvious reasons.

Hmmm... I think I'll cc the cube list with this.  Might be interesting
to some.  I wonder how I could squeeze some of this into the Cube FAQ...
