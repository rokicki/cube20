Subject: Re: (5x5x5) edge parity corrections
Cc: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

This should solve the edge parity problem by swapping the
edge F-Ru and edge F-Rd pieces.

R2 d L2 d L2 d' R2 u' F2 u2 F2 u' F2 L2 F l' F' L2 F l F

This move swaps only these two pieces and some centrals, but only within
their face. A variant of this move should be scalable to solve parity
issues in any NxNxN cube.

The only way I can think of to not have the parity problem, or at least not
require such a long series, is to solve centrals last. Another other idea
would be to spot the parity problem much earlier by counting edge flips.
Not very easy for a person to do, but I have seen it done in software for
normal 3x3x3 cubes. If it were were known very early in either the centers
first or layered solution, it would be trivial to fix.
