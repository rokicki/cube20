Subject: Speed Cubing

I have I question for any one willing to answer. I was wondering if the
people who can get the rubik's cube under 45 seconds did you actually
figure it all out by yourself. Or did you find out how through books,
email, websites etc? My best time is 90 seconds but I can't seem to beat
it the way I do it. I don't want any one telling me ways to do it faster
because I want to find out for myself. But I am wondering are there
certain ways to achieve faster times. Please just answer yes or no. Also
I have just ordered the 5x5x5 and I was wondering how much harder is it
than the 4x4x4. Thanks.

[Moderator's note: Send responses to Karen; I hope she will send
 cube-lovers a summary of the results of her survey. ]
