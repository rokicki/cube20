Subject: meffert's web site and puzzles

i'm glad to hear that uwe effert is still making puzzles.
i hope this means he'll make that master pyraminx (which
was once planned) in which edges can also turn!

and while i'm dreaming ... how about a higher order pyramid,
preferably also of the edge-turning as well as peak-turning
variety?  david byrden's web site has some puzzles i'd like
to see made: the icosahedron, the octahedral "oddity", ...

any chance of making any of these?

mike
