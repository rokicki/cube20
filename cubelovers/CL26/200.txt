Subject: RE: parity pairs

	Conway noted the two mirror-image orientations of the standard colour
pattern (W/Y, B/G, R/O).  One of the corners has  BOY  at a corner and he called
this a  BOY,  versus the mirror-image  YOB.  I think he read the colours clockwise?
Certainly most of the production was  BOY  and one had to hunt a bit for  YOBs.
Some cubists were particularly keen to have one orientation rather than the
other.
