Subject: Re: Method for Solving the Professor's Cube (5x5x5)

Although I use a different method, centrals first, edge combinations, edge
parity corrections, finish using 3x3x3 solution.

I was playing with a layered solution last week also, amazing coincidence.
Much of my solution is the same as Han's.

Most of the differences are in the 4th and 5th layers.
To move the 4th layer mid centrals into place:

central D-face bm to central F-face dm: F l D l' D' F'

If there are no central pieces in the bottom central area, simply move a
bottom central up causing another central to go down.

To move 4th layer edges into place:

edge L-face Db to edge F-Rd: R' D' r D R D' r'
edge R-face Db to edge F-Ld: L D l' D' L' D l

My 5th layer edge moves are a bit different but I haven't had time to write
them down with this terminology.
