Here is one more tidbit on this subject.  The program which performed the
God's Algorithm search for the no-twist corners only case produced a
summary by symmetry class.  I was surprised to note that there were two
positions for which Symm(x)=M.

Normally, there is only one position for the corners where Symm(x)=M,
namely the position which fixes all the corners (i.e., Start).  However,
if twists are ignored, then the central inversion of the corners has the
property that Symm(x)=M.  This is analogous to the Pons Asinorum position
where the edges are centrally inverted.
