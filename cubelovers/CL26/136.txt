Subject: help on 5x5x5 wings

I am trying to solve my new cube the 5x5x5 cube.

I have managed to solve all of it except the wings.

The wings are the y's in the following diagram:


ZyZyZ
yZZZy
ZZZZZ
yZZZy
ZyZyZ

I have many moves for the 3x3x3 but I can't figure out how to apply these moves
to the wings.

Thanks for all help.

/Martin
