Subject: color

Hello, cube-lovers,

May I address an issue of cube colors, brought here by Dr. Singmaster?

Color problem is crucial to those of us who engage in creating
multi-cube designs, particularly if those designs are 3-dimensional. In
such designs it is possible to suppress colors and create designs of,
e.g., three colors only on its faces. No, I have not gone insane, I know
what I am talking about.

It is most unpleasant for a designer to have stickers falling off his or
her cubes! The cubes should be well-made and their colors distinct. I
find the orange and red colors to be nearly identical in hue. The red is
light and the orange is dark, which is bad. I try to solve the problemn
by suppressing orange in my 3-, 4- and 5-color designs, but it is
irritating. Why  can't the cube makers replace red-orange colors by
pink-dark red for better contrast?

Another issue is parity pairs. In solution algoirithms you  don't kave
to know them, but they are crucial in 3-dimensional-design algorithms.
They make the above-mentioned color suppression possible. Now why can't
the manufacturers sell such pairs? If they don't know what parity pairs
are, I will tell them.

[Moderator's note: By parity pairs, I rather suspect he means mirror-image
pairs.]
