Subject: ADDITIONAL FEATURES FOR OUR PUZZLE SITE
Date: Mon, 28 Dec 1998 01:47:54 +0800


Requesting Help:

For 1999 I will be adding a lot of additional interactive puzzles &
games to the "Meffert's World of Puzzles" site in several puzzle
categories enabling a person to challenge a friend or send an
interactive  puzzle greeting.

Each Puzzle Challenge will be made available for 30 days, with actual
time taken to solve it being relayed back to the challenger.  After the
Puzzle Challenge is received, the challenge can be accepted or rejected
or a counter challenge made.

Puzzle Games will also be available online.  I am hoping to have a very
large range of categories from very simple games & puzzles such as
electronic tik tak toe (from single layer to triple layer) with some
additional new features, the traditional 8 and 15 piece sliding puzzles
with talking help function, the Orbix & Orbix Junior (12 & 6 lights in 3
colors) Electronic Reversy etc. etc. etc. to more complex puzzles &
games.

Whilst I have developed some of these already I will need a lot of help
from puzzlers worldwide to make this the best FREE interactive really
Great Puzzle and Games site for 1999.

Please spread the word to anyone you know that can contribute and other
puzzle site Web Editors that may let me use some of their existing
puzzles.

I hope to have very unique graphics and concepts to really popularize
puzzles again, this time as a Free service over the Internet.   To
appeal to the majority of the people the puzzles must not be too hard,
yet still be challenging.

Also, I am presently looking for a new Web Editor for our site, our
present Webmaster Andrew Southern is unfortunately fully tied up until
July with his studies,  please pass the word along to anyone you think
my be suitable.

Many Thanks


Warm regards and a Very Happy New Year to All.
