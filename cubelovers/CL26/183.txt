At www.rubiks.com, go into the "news" section. The 
announcement for an OddzOn deluxe Cube was added on March 
11th.

[Moderator's note: http://www.rubiks.com/deluxe.html says in one place
 that they are planning to have "super high quality durable stickers"
 and in another that "there won't be stickers" so it's anyone's guess
 what they have in mind.  They're also considering "holographic center
 labels" vs. "the classic look" and say they will be conducting a
 poll.  Rumors that the Tartan design is being promoted by one of its
 inventors are unverified, and those were gifts, not bribes.  --Dan]
