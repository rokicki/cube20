Now that the archive is fixed again, here is the message that I sent to
resurrect the list:

From: alan@ai.mit.edu (Alan Bawden)
Date: Fri, 12 Oct 90 16:03:05 EDT
To: cube-lovers
Subject: Surprise!

That's right.  Cube-Lovers has returned from the dead.  Due to various
hardware, software and personal crises, Cube-Lovers has been down since
sometime last spring.  I'm sure that many of you didn't even notice, given
what a low-volume list this has become.

Our "official" addresses remain Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for submissions
and Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.  (Actually, you
will find that using simply "...@AI.MIT.EDU" will work just as well.)

Since this is the first message to this list after moving it to a new
machine with a different mailer, I expect that many addresses on the list
have ceased to function.  If I were you, I wouldn't send any mail here for
about a week -- just to give me a chance to process all the bounces I'm
about to get.

The archives are currently unavailable, but I hope to have them available
for FTP soon.

OK, I think I've cleaned up Cube-Lovers enough that it's safe for anyone to
use it.  (For some of you this message is the first indication that
Cube-Lovers is back -- many copies of my first announcement bounced back to
me.)

Those of you who keep asking for the archives will be pleased to know that
they are again available for anonymous FTP: Connect to AI.MIT.EDU, login as
"anonymous" (any password), and in the directory "/pub/alan" you will find
the seven (compressed) files "cube-mail-0.Z" through "cube-mail-6.Z".

(Unfortunately, due to the way mail works here at the AI Lab, it is not
possible to have the current active archive accumulate anywhere where
anonymous FTP can pick it up.)

As you can see, things really slacked off after 1982, and we were really
quiet during the middle of the decade.

For those of you who missed my first message, let me repeat that our
"official" addresses remain Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for submissions and
Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.

American magazine, has launched a personal programming newsletter,
Algorithm. The new publication is aimed at amateur and professional
programmers alike. It extends the Computer Recreations tradition of
recreational and educational programming projects: the Mandelbrot set,
cellular automata, chaos and dynamics, weird machines, stellar
simulation, puzzles and many other topics.

      The new publication carries seven features and will expand to
include more columns. Currently, it includes Algoletter, advice from
professionals; Easy Pieces, fascinating projects for beginning
programmers by Michael Ecker of Creative Computing fame; Personal
Programs, exercises for more advanced programmers by Cliff Pickover,
IBM's computer graphics wizard; Algopuzzles, computer mind-benders by
Dennis Shasha, author of The Puzzling Adventures of Dr. Ecco; Algofact
and Algofiction, invited articles and stories from well-known
scientists and authors. A Bulletin Board advertises hosts of
recreational products by individuals and small companies.

It depends on how you take it apart.  If you just pull out the corner
and edge pieces then put them back in without respect to color, the
probability is one in 12 that you will put it back into the right
orbit.  I won't bore you with yet another proof of this; if you spent
the last decade in a box see the archives, Singmaster's NOTES ON
RUBIK'S MAGIC CUBE, J. A. Eidswick's article in the March 1986 Math
Monthly, or even Hofstadter's METAMAGICAL THEMAS.

Now if you take the face centers off and scramble them, then there is
only one chance in 60 of getting it right.  Of the 720 permutations of
the six face centers, only 24 can be generated by rigid motions of the
cube.  But half of these 24 permutations are odd, and leaving the cube
in an unsolvable orbit.  If you put the face centers on in the
``standard'' configuration with opposite faces ``differing by yellow''
(i.e., white opposite yellow, red opposite orange, and blue opposite
green), your chances go up to one in four--half the time you will get
an odd permutation, and half the time you will get a mirror-reversed
configuration.

But wait, if you took the face centers off you probably noticed that
the corners and edges don't stay on very well.  So, say you scrambled
all three kinds of pieces.  You will be able to solve the resulting
cube if you could solve the corner/edge permutation and the face-
center permutation.  But if the only thing keeping you from solving
the corner/edge permutation and the face-center permutation is that
both permutation parities were odd, then you will be able to solve the
two of them together.  Therefore your chances of success are one in
360 (= (1/12)*(1/60)*2), or one in 24 if you preserved opposite pairs
of face centers.

Now suppose you peeled off the 54 colored stickers and stuck them back
on at random (carefully keeping them out of the reach of children, as
there are rumors the paint contains lead, especially on the cheap
Taiwanese knockoffs), what is the probability of getting a solvable
cube?  This question was posed years ago (in Singmaster?) but I
believe it is still open.

This seems easy, so I've probably messed up on something.
Can anyone catch a mistake?

Assume each of the stickers is given a number from 1 to 54.  Then
there are 54! different labelings, ignoring rotation of stickers
(we'll ignore this throughout, so we'll never need to consider it).
Thus there are

  54!
  = 230843697339241380472092742683027581083278564571807941132288000000000000
  = 2.3*10^71

ways to randomly resticker the cube.  We want to know what proportion
of these are legal (i.e., the cube can be solved).

There are 8!*12!*8^3*2^12/12 = 43252003274489856000 = 4.3*10^19 legal
cube states.  Thus there are this many legal stickerings, if each
sticker must go back to where it was.  Since they need not (just the
color must match), there are really an additional (9!)^6 for each of
these, or 98760760257294265888495040331277846607560704000000000 =
9.9*10^52 legal stickerings.

Thus the proportion of randomly restickered cubes that can be solved,
and hence the probability that a randomly restickered cube can be solved,
is

= 9.9*10^52/2.3*10^71 = 4.3*10^-19

Subject: Re: Rubik's Cube reassembly problem and solution

Aside from the disassembly/assembly problem there was another problem that
I have not yet seen answered satisfactory.  The question is:  what is the
maximum number of stickers that can bee peeled of such that there is still
an unique solution for the cube (i.e. the remaining stickers must match in
color on a face).  The only solution I have seen was along the lines (this
is from memory, but I do not think there are any mistakes):
1.  The total rotation of the corner cubes is 0, so there is one corner
    cube that can have all its stickers removed; the remaining corner
    cubes need at least one sticker.  Suppose this is the FUR cube.
    (3 stickers.)
2.  You can remove two stickers (F, R and/or U) from each of FRD, BRU, FLU;
    they still remain distinguishable.  (6 stickers.)
3.  Of the remaining corner cubes (DBL, DRB, ULB, DLF) you cannot *now*
    (emphasis mine) remove two stickers because the cube will become
    indistinguishable from one of the cubes handled in step 2.  You can
    remove sticker R, U and F from DRB, ULB and DLF respectively.  No
    other stickers can be removed.  (3 stickers.)
4.  Because of flip parity you can remove two stickers from (say) FU.
    (2 stickers.)
5.  You can remove the F sticker from all of FR, FL and FD.  (3 stickers.)
6.  Now, because of the product parity of corner cubes permutation and
    edge cube permutation you can make either two corner cubes identical or
    two edge cubes.  You must nevertheless still be able to observe both
    the corner twist parity and the edge flip parity.  This means you may
    a.  Remove a single sticker from any edge cube that still has two stickers.
    b.  Remove a single sticker from the DLB cube.
    (You can not remove two stickers from the DLB cube.  Say you remove the L
    and B sticker.  Let us denote removed sticker by lower case letters.
    In that case Dlb is indistinguishable from Dfr, which is not a problem.
    But the DLf cube can now be put in the Dlb position, leading to a 3-cycle.)
    (1 sticker.)
7.  You can remove the sticker from the front center cube.  (1 sticker.)

This leads to a total of 19 removable stickers.

This is not maximal.  There are, for instance, other ways to do corner cubes:
1.  Remove all F stickers.  (4 stickers.)
2.  From all Fxy cubes, remove the y sticker.  (4 stickers.)
3.  Also from all Bxy cubes, remove the y sticker.  (4 stickers.)
4.  From one Bxy cube remove also an x sticker.  (1 sticker.)
5.  From one Fxy cube remove also an x sticker.  (1 sticker.)
(Fxy and Bxy named clockwise.)
This leads to 14 stickers for the corners and a total of 21.
Are there other ways leading to more?  Are there better ways that we can
remove more center stickers?

I just caught a bug in my reasoning.  The restickering need not yield
something equivalent to the original undestickered cube, but rather
just one that can be solved to obtain solid colors on each face.
Since there are 5*3*2 different distinguishable cubes (i.e., 30
different ways to label a die with the numbers 1-6) (6! labelings, but
rotational symmetry removes 24 -- six faces can be brought to the top,
and for each it can be rotated around the axis perpendicular to that
face in one of 4 ways), the numerator should be multiplied by 30, and
hence the probability is actually

Hello there,

This is my first posting to the cube-lovers board, so I'm
probably gonna ask a couple of really obvious questions:

a) Does anyone know where I can get a copy of David Singmaster's
   book "Notes on Rubik's magic cube?"  This was THE definitive book
   on the cube about 8 years ago, but I lost my copy....does anyone
    know if it's still in print?? ( Oh yeah, maybe I should mention
   that I'm in England...David Singmaster was a lecturer at one of
   the colleges in London I think - was this book EVER published in
   the states? )

b) ( This is a real obvious one... )   Does anyone have any tips or
   advice on solving the 4*4*4 cube that appeared a few years after
   the original 3*3*3 one.  I got really close to getting it right
   a couple of years ago, but never quite made it.

Thanks in advance for any help,

That's where I got the last few I was missing.  Jerry Slocum in

I have not looked at it for several years but if memory serves you need
only one extra transformation which is not applicable to the 3^3. It is
the single edge flip. I no longer recall it explicitly but it was kinda
trivial to find.

Subject: Re: Rubik's Cube reassembly problem and solution

This problem of counting the number of solvable restickerings seems to
be a lot easier than I had thought, but a lot trickier than you might
think.

Haym Hirsh sent in a buggy analysis, then corrected himself, but not
quite enough.  The fix was to account for cases where the stickers
corresponded to a cube recoloring, but he just multiplied by 30 (cube
recolorings up to rotational symmetry) rather than by 720 (total cube
recolorings).  We are dividing by 54!, which includes positions
differing only by a rotation, so when figuring how many are solvable
you have to count such positions also.

Another way of figuring this is 6! ways of coloring the face centers,
then (8! 3^8 12! 2^12)/12 ways of coloring the rest of the cube, then
9!^6 ways of arranging stickers among identically-colored faces, out
of 54! ways of arranging stickers randomly.

So the probability that a random restickering will be solvable is

        71107747385251871439716429038520049557443706880000000000

           40122452017152
 = ------------------------------  ~ 3.0803 X 10^-16.
   130253249618151492335575683325

It seems odd to me that this is not the reciprocal of an integer, but
I guess that's because we are dealing with color cosets rather than
some cube group.

Haym Hirsch also asked me how to figure out the minimum number of
stickers to fix to make an unsolvable stickering solvable.  Sounds
hard to me.  His question arises in the same way that I recall the
original problem arising: trying to clean up after someone who tried
to solve the cube by restickering.  Since the adhesive isn't designed
for moving the stickers around, this leads rapidly to Dik Winter's
problem: dealing cubes that have lost some of their stickers.

Sure....

  -  REC is VERY slanted toward high school students, and so there is
     very little advanced or profound stuff in there.
  -  While there is a nod to other worlds, primarily it is all in BASIC,
     and generally focused on the IBM PC.
  -  There is a fascination with mindless crunching just to print out
     numbers that I can't fathom.  A good portion of the articles
     center on a numbers with some odd property or another, or finding
     the actual _numeric_ solution to something and usually brute force
     [or close to it].  The graphics hacks, such as they are, are
     primarily crunching-based [moire patterns and such].

No real discussion of 'puzzles', for example, nor of the kinds of techniques
and such you need to partially-tame one of those awful [but real world]
exponential searches, nor of representing 3D objects or manipulations of them,
or search strategies, no word problems, etc.

a dodecahedron.  The inside modules create an interior icosahedron.

I used 3M Post-It notes cut in half, each starting rectangle being 3" by 1-
1/2".  I folded the adhesive to the inside on the first step, so the
adhesive was not holding the project together.  It probably would have been
possible to use the adhesive to keep each module together.  This would have
required a lot of extra care in the assembly, but produced a much sturdier
product.  As it was, once I got the hang of it, I didn't have any major
problems with modules coming apart.  The finished construction required no
staples or extra glue.

A previous attempt using 1" x 2" rectangles cut out of graph paper kept
falling apart.  I've got a partially finished ornament made with dollar
bills, which seem to work fine.

The ideal shape for an outside module is not an equilateral triangle, but an
isosceles one with an apex angle of about 42 degrees.  I took care of this
by allowing the outside surfaces to bow outward.

To finish the assembly I left three outside modules and their common
connecting module until last.  The outside modules were threaded into place
but not closed, with the ends of the paper pointing outward.  The connecting
module was placed over the nearest ends of the three outside modules, then
the outside modules could be closed.

I have made something along the lines that Peter Beck describes in
his "construction project", but it does not quite fit his
description, so I don't know if it is the same thing. It uses only
50 modules and I can't for the life of me imagine where the other 70
should go.

My object looks like this.  Imagine a regular icosahedron (20
equilateral triangular faces, with 5 coming together at each
vertex).  Erect on each of these faces a triangular prism (20
modules).  At each edge of the icosahedron, two square faces of
adjacent prisms rise up from the surface of the icosahedron.  Band
each such pair together with a module (30 modules).  The reulting
form resembles the Archmidean solid most conveniently designated
(3,4,5,4), which means that each vertex contains a triangle, square,
pentagon, square, in that order.

I say "resembles" this solid, in part, because only the squares are
actually present, the triangular and pentagonal "faces" are voids.
But a more compelling reason for saying "resembles" is that the
geometry is only approximate.  If one uses the modules you describe
for the triangular prisms (that is, the height of the prism equals
the edge of the triangle) then the quadrilateral faces on the outer
surface connecting the triangular and pentagonal voids are not
squares, but rectangles whose side are in the ratio of (sqrt 5)-1 to
(sqrt 3).  This discrepancy can be fudged, by allowing the squares
to bulge outward slightly.  On the other hand, a figure could be
constructed where the outer quadrilaterals were in fact square, but
this would require the prisms to be shorter, and that cannot be
fudged.

Better results can be achieved if you do not fudge the geometry (or
at least not much).  It turns out that

	(/ (- (sqrt 5) 1) (sqrt 3)) = 5/7 

(pardon my lisp) to within one tenth of one percent. Hence I make my
modules as diagrammed below.  Dimensions given assume paper in the
ratio of 2 to 1.

This module is used to make the triangular prisms:

    _______________________________________________
   |         :             :             :         | 5/24
   |.........:.............:.............:.........|
   |         :             :             :         |
   |         :             :             :         | 7/12
   |         :             :             :         |
   |.........:.............:.............:.........|
   |         :             :             :         | 5/24
   |_________:_____________:_____________:_________|
       1/2        1/2           1/2          1/2


This module is used to band the triangular prisms together:

    _______________________________________________
   |         :             :             :         | 1/4
   |.........:.............:.............:.........|
   |         :             :             :         |
   |         :             :             :         | 1/2
   |         :             :             :         |
   |.........:.............:.............:.........|
   |         :             :             :         | 1/4
   |_________:_____________:_____________:_________|
      5/12        7/12          7/12        5/12


Natually, you might ask, how do I fold 5/12?  There is a trick.
First fold the the long edge in half, and then in quarters at one
end, but don't make the second crease go all the way across--just
nick one edge of the paper, as a marker (point B).  Now fold point B
to touch the upper left-hand corner (point A).  This would make a
diagonal crease across the strip, but again, don't make the crease
go all the way across--just nick the lower edge (point C).  The line
AC is the hypoteneuse of the old 5,12,13 right triangle, and point C is
at 5/12, as desired.  (Pretty neat, huh?)

       A _______________________________________________
        |                      :                        |
        |                      :                        |
        |                      :                        |
 12/12  |                      :                        |
        |                      :                        |
        |                      :                        |
        |                      :                        |
        |_______:______________:_____________:__________|
          5/12  C     7/12           6/12    B   6/12


A similar technique is used to make the other module.

I did not need any staples.

Subject: Is Meffert still around?

	I am wondering if Meffert is still around, with his club to purchase
new and interesting Cube products.  If he is, would somebody please send me
his address and what the current membership fee is.  Also a price list.

	If he is not, would people be interested in restarting such a club?
I have a hard time believing that there aren't enough people for a cube-of-
the-month club (or perhaps cube-of-the-quarter) as these things are not that
complex (ie., expensive) to produce.  We might even be able to do runs in
rolled aluminum instead of plastic.

SHORT ANSWER:  Meffert's puzzle club is dead!

MORE:  Meffert is alive and is trying to get back into the puzzle
 business - if you want specific information Jerry Slocum, beverly
hills has been in conatct with him.

PUZZLE CLUBS, ETC.:  
1 - the economics of a puzzle club is that well made  puzzles (both
from a design and engineering perspective) cost $20 and up.
2 - people interested in being current on whats happening in puzzles
should subscribe to CFF, Puzzletopia and possible ARM (all have been
discussed before)


I have been busy but CFF#25 (silver aniverssary; cost $18) is 5
volumes plus vendor catalogs (bandelow, constatin) and encompassses
the last 10 tears of puzzling around the world.

SOME RETAIL PUZZLE SOURCES:

map locator -->  MCCC is near the intersection of US #1 and I-295.

Here's how to get to a parking space at TCF!

Guaranteed parking is available at Mercer County Park, which surrounds
the MCCC campus on three sides.  MCP has two entrances, one on Rt 535
(Edinburg Rd. or Old Trenton Rd., depending on whether you're north or
south of MCCC) and one on Hughes Drive.  My advice is to turn off at a
park entrance.  HOWEVER, if you're early (on sat this means before 7
on sun before 9) or if you're daring, continue past the park entrance
to the College entrance.  If you're lucky, the gendarmes will let you
on campus to look for a parking space.  IF THEY REFUSE YOU ACCESS,
continue to the traffic light and turn (either LEFT onto Old Trenton
Rd. or RIGHT onto Hughes Drive.) and proceed to the  Park entrance.

FROM THE NORTH:

1) VIA U.S. 1: Go south on US 1 and take the Rt 533 South
(Quakerbridge
Rd.) overpass.  After about two miles, turn left onto Hughes Dr.  The
Park entrance will be on your left in about a mile, with the College
entrance about 0.5 miles further.

2) VIA N.J. TURNPIKE: Go south to Exit 8 (Hightstown) and get on Rt 33
WEST.  In downtown Hightstown, turn right onto Rt 571 and follow.
 Near
GE Astro, turn left onto Rt 535.  The Park entrance is about 4 miles
down
the road, with the College entrance about a mile further.

FROM THE SOUTH:

1) VIA U.S. 1: Go north on Rt. 1 and turn right onto Rt 546 (at Mrs.
G's
Appliances).  Just after the overpass, turn right onto Youngs Rd.
 Follow
to the end and turn right onto Hughes Drive.  The Park entrance is
about
a mile away.

2) VIA I-95: I-95 NORTH becomes I-295 SOUTH (don't ask!).  Take Exit
65A,
Sloan Rd and follow to the end (Sloan Rd. becomes Flock Rd. at the
light -
also don't ask!!).  Go left onto Old Trenton Rd.  The Campus entrance
is
by a jughandle turn, about a mile up Old Trenton Rd.  The Park
entrance
is on the left about a mile further up.

3) VIA I-295: Follow I-295 NORTH to its temporary end at Rt 130, and
go
north to Rt. 206 where you will follow signs to TRENTON and then to

I-295 NORTH. Take Exit 65A to Sloan Ave. and follow it to the end.  Go
left
on Old Trenton Rd.  The campus entrance is by a jughandle turn, about
a mile up Old Trenton Rd.  The Park entrance is on the left about a
mile further.

4) VIA N.J. TURNPIKE:  Take Exit 7A to I-195 WEST.  Take the first
exit,
5B to Rt 130 NORTH.  Left at the first light onto Rt. 526  Bear left
and take an immediate right, still on Rt 526.  At end, turn left onto
Rt 535, Old Trenton Rd.  The Park entrance is a bout a mile away; the

College, another mile.

..  partial list of attendees (about 100 puzzlers attended):  
     NOB, a prominent Japanese puzzler
     Ed Hordern author of Sliding Block book published by OUP
     Jerry Slocum, party arranger and author of Puzzles Old & New
     Kathy Jones, owner of Kadon
     Solomon Golomb, polycube inventor
     Jose Grant, designer of jewelry quality puzzle rings
     Scott Kim, inversions
     Christoph Bandelow, German seller of magic polyhedra and author
     Doug Engel, designer of circle puzzler, flexagon based puzzles
     James Dalgety, a founder of Pentangle

..  4 artists in attendance:  one makes sculptures that assemble as
puzzles, one makes pattern assembly puzzles by vacuum deposition of
metals on glass squares, one makes Tiffany style lamps using tangram
pieces & silhouettes for the design, the last uses puzzles primarily
for inspiration.

	The GameKeeper (in the Valley Fair Mall in San Jose) actually has
5x5x5 Rubik's cubes on sale (for $37 I think).  They had three in stock on
Saturday.

	Are we seeing a renascence of cubing?  This is certainly a welcome
development.

(First: personal to Ronnie: THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK
YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
I've been looking for a 5by for _years_.)

I just called.  First, the cubes are at Games GALLERY (boy, you guys on the
west coast sure have friendly, helpful phone operators.  Also store owners:
when I called the nearest GamesKeeper that the operator could find, the
manager there gave the number for Games Gallery!).  $27.95.  They got them
from Dr Christopher <somethingortheother> in Germany.

And, yes, they have a couple left after taking my phone order.  ;)

Nichael

BTW, Graham (the guy that I talked to at GG --is _everybody_ this friendly
out there?) said they had about a half-dozen new Rubik's toys (i.e. "new" =
post Rubik's Clock).  Including something called "Rubik's 15", which Graham
(note how we're on a first-name basis now) described as "like the old 15-
puzzle, but *NASTY*!"

Does anybody know any of these?

Message-Id: <CMM-RU.1.0.672423976.hirsh@pei.rutgers.edu>

After seeing my collection of Rubik's magics in my office, a student
came by yesterday with a variation I hadn't seen before.  It is a 2x4
version, but the 8 "tiles" are colored differently.  Each of the eight
tiles has a "four-square" pattern -- the square is divided into four
regions, each colored red, blue, yellow, or green.  The center of each
is black with Rubik's signature on it.  The tiles thus look something
like the following:

	+----+----+
	|Blue|Yell|
	|   / \ ow|
	+--+   +--+
	|   \ /   |
	|Red |Gree|
	+----+----+

(with Rubik's signature in the center)

Both the front and back tiles have this four-square pattern.  However,
on one side the order of colors on the tiles are all as in the picture
above, and on the other side four have that order and the remaining
four have yellow and green switched (so that blue and yellow are on
opposite corners).

I don't know if this description gets the idea across to those who
have never seen one like this, but I'm more interested in those who
have seen it.  Is anyone familiar with this version, and if so, what
is the goal pattern to reach?  It turns out that the student worked at
Bradlees (a downscale version of Kmart, if such a thing is possible)
four years ago, and he got it from the returns bin, without any
packaging.  I've looked at it briefly, and didn't come up with an
obvious goal pattern.

About the only other info that may be helpful is that the copyright
for this variation is 1987.  The copyright for the original 2x4 is
1986, and similarly for the 2x2 I have; the 2x6 is copyright 1987.

Finally, since I am on the topic of the magic, I have heard a
number of times about yet another version of the magic that can
be folded into a cube.  Does anyone know any sources for it?
(I thought for a while that the alternate-coloring version may
be it, but it seems to have the same connectivity as the standard
2x4.)

Thanks for any help!

The version your student has is the one where the object is to fold it
into a cube (I have it, with the instructions. Yes, it does have the
same structure as the original 2x4 one---you can fold that one
into a cube (with two "flaps") too. The object is to fold it
into a cube where the colors of the three faces meeting at each corner
always match.

I called and ordered things from this store in California, and just
recieved things over the past two days.

THE 5X5X5 CUBE!!!!!!!!

(I just started the 5X5X5 about 2 hours ago, and already have all but a
few on the bottom.  I think it will be MUCH easier than the 4X4X4.  It
comes with instructs on how to open it, and I took it apart to look. 
THIS DESIGN IS IMPRESSIVE!  You can make some REALLY neat patterns with
the 5x5x5.)

5x5x5 from:
Dr. Christoph Bandelow
Haarholzer Str.  13
4620 Bochum 1
Germany

Write (Dr. Bandelow) for a free mail order catalog with many twisting
puzzles and books about these puzzles.

The new Rubik's things:

Rubik's Dice:  
	Rubik's Dice, unlike any other dice, has nothing to do with luck.  It
has spots whose color can be changed from white to red and from red to
white.  Rbik's Dice in fact, is a hollow cube with which has 7 plates
inside it.  The plates are white with red dots on them.  The plates are
loose but adhere to the inner sides of the cube.  By shaking and turning
the cube, the postition and orientation of the plates can be changed and
this in turn alters the color of the spots of the dice.
	Object:	Re-arrange the plates within the cube in such a way that the
dice has white and only white spots.  If red is shown anywhere on the
dice even through the small controll holes -- the puzzle is not
complete.  The number of possible combinations is 7! x 4^7=82,575,360. 
There is however, ony one correct solution.

Rubik's Tangle:
	Rubik's Tngle has 25 square tiles each tile has the very same pattern
of ropes, but the color of the ropes varies.
	Object:	Lay down the tiles into a 5X5 square in such a way that each
colored rop forms it's own continuous line.
24! x 4^24 = 1746 x 10^38 ( I have a feeling it should be 25!, not 24!)
2 correct solutions.

4 different tangle puzzles.
each worrks by itself (differently) and together they form a 10X10 grid
that also works

Rubik's Triamid
	Dumb, and i'm tired, so I won't explain.  I'm disappointed in this one,
don't buy it.

Rubik's 15:
	2 puzzles: one side is a magic square
		 the other side is a fifteen puzzle
 but the mechanisms that manouver pieces are SICK!
both can't be solved at once.


Sorry, I started typing in the sheet that explained them all, but i'm
falling asleep, so I just finished by explaining them a little.

Synchronicity!! I was just typing in a virtually identical message when
Dale's posting came!  (D: thanks for saving me all the typing.  ;)

>(I just started the 5X5X5 about 2 hours ago, and already have all but a

Yeah, I think anyone who _understands_ how to work a 3by or a 4by (as
opposed to merely memorizing cookbook solutions) should have no problem
with it.

I'm certainly no speed whiz.  The UPS man rang the doorbell at 1pm and I
had scrambled and "solved" it by 3[*].  (Solved is in quotes because I had
the cube completly done except that two non-central edge-cubies were
flipped.  It took me another 15-20 minutes to back out and fix this.)

  [* this includes feeding lunch to my two daughters and a few minutes of
     code-debugging over the phone.]

>THIS DESIGN IS IMPRESSIVE!  You can make some REALLY neat patterns with
>the 5x5x5.)  

(I've got one of mine completely covered in checkerboard patterns).

As Dale says, the 5by seems very solid.  Probably this is because it has an
odd number of cubes and so has the fixed center cubie.  Certainly it moves
more consistently smoothly than my 4bys.  On the other hand, at least once
I've felt one of the cubies start to pop out in my hand while I was turning
it.

Another thing: the cubies are starting to get pretty small.  The whole cube
is only about 1/4 longer on each side than my 4by.

My only concern is _where_ do these cubes actually come from?  The rest of
my cubes (2X, 3X, 4X) have _all_ had the Rubik's symbol and copyright
notices on them.  These 5bys have neither.  Could these be pirated cubes?
On the other hand they seem solidly made and the colors are bright and
distinct unlike most cheepy copy-cubes that I've seen.  But it's curious
that there are no copyright notices _anywhere_ either the cube or the
enclosing box.

Oh well.  Something to keep my hands busy during those long compiles for
the next couple of weeks.

Cheers

	OK, for everybody out there with the 5-cube, this is the most difficult
pattern I have come up with to implement (which is still highly ordered).

Where this pattern is also present on the remaining 3 sides.  (This amounts
to twirling a 4-cube, a 3-cube, a 2-cube and a 1-cube around a pair of
diagonally opposite corners in alternating directions.  It's not difficult
to do after you've done it a couple of times, but the potential for getting
confused is surprising.

	As far as I can tell, if you can solve the order 3 and order 4 cube,
you should be able to solve the order 5 with no additional fiddling, even if
you only know cookbook solutions.

	Spoiler follows:

	I solve the off-center edges first (just like in the order 4 cube--
the transformations are identical), then the corners (exactly like all other
orders, from 2 through 4), then the center edges (exactly like the order 3
cube, just treat the two edge faces as attached and you have an order 3
cube).  All that's left are the eight centers.  Four of these can be solved
exactly as in the order 4, and if you can't generalize your cookbook solution
to solve the remaining 4 you have no business cubing.

	I suspect this is why there are (and will probably never be) cubes of
orders greater than 5.  I believe (though have not proved) that the 5 cube 
contains all the complexity that is possible.  Adding more cubies would only
increase the amount of time needed to solve.

	On the other hand, I would be willing to pay a fair amount of money for
an order 21 cube. :-)

	No, I think the 24! is correct.  Since we don't count rotations as
different, the first tile can be placed any way you want without affecting

On the other hand, a 5X (or any cube of odd order) will still have the
constraints imposed by a fixed center.  As a single example, the 4X here in
my office is completely "solved" except that two opposite corners are
swapped.  That's not something that can happen on a cube of odd order (at
least I don't think so, but I would love to be proved wrong ;).

You can't make an order 21 cube, or any cube of order 7 or higher.
When you turn the top layer of such a cube by 45 degrees, the corner
cubie will not touch the other layers at all, so there's
no way to keep it attached, and it will fall off.

No, Because off the rotation, the 4^25 goes down to 4^24, but again, I
still think that it should be 25!, because there are that many pieces to
be arranged.

I solve the cubes in a way much different than lots that people have explained:

(Don't read if you don't want!)

I pick a "top" side and solve it.
I put the centers together(on the order 3, this was REAL easy! :-)
I put the edges together that go from the top to the bottom.
I solve the bottom 4 corners
I solve the bottom 4 middles.

depending on which cube, the 2nd and 3rd steps are switched.

I am only having one problem with the 5x5x5 cube, though:


X|O|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|O|X

looking at the bottom of my cube, the 2 pieces marked O are swaped
sometimes, so that the face is still a solid color, but the sides are
swapped.

I also got it to have the swapped pieces near each other:

X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X
O|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|O|X

My question is this:

I can't figure out what causes the swapping.
Is it the because in this face,

X|X|X|X|X
X|O|I|O|X
X|I|X|I|X
X|O|I|O|X
X|X|X|X|X

the I's and the O's are in the "wrong" positions, even though they are
indestingiushable?

Dale, 

What is wrong is that *one* of the inner planes [marked 1 & 2 above] are a
quarter turn [i.e. 90dgs] out of phase.

1] The way I solve this is to turn one of the planes a quarter turn, [to
get, for example the following]:

>X|O|X|o|X      <--(Where "o" is the other face of the "O" above.)
>X|X|X|Y|X
>X|X|X|Y|X
>X|X|X|Y|X
>X|X|X|Y|X
   ^   ^
   1   2

2] Then, to keep things straight in my head, I then "mark" the new position
by replacing the center cubies in the turned plane to their correct
positions (being careful not to mess with anything else --particularly the
edge pieces):

>X|O|X|o|X
>X|X|X|X|X
>X|X|X|X|X
>X|X|X|X|X
>X|X|X|Y|X
   ^   ^
   1   2

There's a relatively simple operator to do this, which I leave as an
exercise for the reader.  ;)

(It's probably better to do this to all affected four faces, but you can
save this until you have solved the edges.)

3] This leaves you five inner, non-central edges to solve.  But it should
be straightforward, so long as you be careful not to mess up anything else.

#$%@!! 

I just realize that I answered the wrong question!  My answer was to the
question:

    "My cube is completely solved *except* that the 2 pieces marked `O' are
     flipped."

(Sorry.)  The right answer should be:

The state of the cube is not:

X|O|X|X|X                  X|A|X|C|X
X|X|X|X|X                  X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X     But rather:  X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|X|X                  X|X|X|X|X
X|X|X|O|X                  X|X|X|B|X

Where cubie "C" just "looks" like it's in the right place.

You need an operator that rotates  A->B->C->A.  (Left as an exercise; hints
available on request.)

This will very likely leave an inconvenient number of edges flipped.  For
the answer to _this_ problem, see my last post.  ;)

   You can't make an order 21 cube, or any cube of order 7 or higher.
   When you turn the top layer of such a cube by 45 degrees, the corner
   cubie will not touch the other layers at all, so there's
   no way to keep it attached, and it will fall off.

Assuming the current technology, anyway.  But imagine a less passive
approach.  Suppose each cubie had a cheap microprocessor, and some
little latches.  Normally cubies hang onto their neighbors, but when
they notice you are applying torque, they let go of their neighbors
in just that one direction and hang on for dear life in the other two
directions.  The latches can also be conducting in order to convey
the necessary actuating power from a centrally placed battery.

Then "Dale I. Newfield" <dn1l+@andrew.cmu.edu> responded:

>There is no law that says that the cubes have to be the same size.

and showed that by making the outer layers thicker, we can increase
the size of the cube.  There is another way around Andy Latto's con-
cern, and that is that we can--at least in theory--design a physical
cube that lets pieces overhang, such as corners that touch only two
surfaces, and yet still holds the pieces so they cannot be removed.

This idea (which came up in talks with Jim Saxe about a decade ago) is
to slice up the cube with a fresnel saw.  A fresnel saw is used to cut
a piece of glass into two fresnel lenses out of pieces of glass, and
you find them in the same stores that sell plaid paint and jelly-
doughnut cookie cutters.  (In case you don't know what a fresnel lens
(pronounced freh-NEL) is, for this note it's sufficient to think of it
as a surface with small concentric circular grooves in it.  Kind of
like those old vinyl recordings people used to listen to, except that
the grooves are circular instead of spiral, and the grooves don't
wiggle back and forth.)

Now if you have two surfaces with mating grooves--each one has a ridge
that fits in each of the other's grooves--when you put them together
you can twist one with respect to the other, but you can't slide one
across the other, because the grooves are locked together.  There is
one thing you can do that we don't want: you can lift one slab away
from the other.

The solution now is to get a *very* *sharp* fresnel saw, that cuts
hooked grooves that interlock with each other.  You get surfaces with
cross sections that look somewhat like

                            hook-in surface

                           hook-out surface

except that the surfaces are closer, so the hooked grooves are engaged
with each other.  (Now we see why we need a fresnel saw, so that we
can cut the two mating surfaces in one cut, and avoid the problem of
trying to assemble two separated pieces (though we could get around
that difficulty messily with glue)).

So we may cut up a 2n+1 x 2n+1 x 2n+1 cube with a fresnel saw, to make
a large Rubik's cube.  The only really touchy point is the need to
make the ``direction'' of each cut match the direction of the other
cuts at that ``depth.''  Here, direction refers to whether the hook-in
surface faces toward the nearest parallel side or away from that side,
and ``depth'' refers to the distance from the nearest parallel side.
This ensures that when we permute cubies around the directions of the
groove hooks will not change, so the grooves will always mate.

If n is large, then pieces of one slab will overhang at each turn, so
you can see the grooves on a whole surface of a corner, or on two
surfaces of an edge piece.  But you can't pull the piece off, because
it won't move straight with respect to the rest of the cube, only in
curved trajectories.  We have to keep the fresnelling small with
 respect to the size of the cubies, and the tolerances are pretty
tight, but that's the regime we theoretical engineers are working in.
(I'd like to mention that cubes made with this method also have the
nice feature that there's a 2n-1 x 2n-1 x 2n-1 Rubik's cube on the
inside, so you can play with the theoretical invisible group while
you're at it.)

Now what about cubes of even side?  The fresnel saw cuts two surfaces
that mate to each other but not to themselves.  How can we get a
surface that mates to itself?  I think the answer is that we can't.
But this doesn't mean we are out of luck, as there are several ways of
fixing up the center cuts of these cubes.  Perhaps easiest way is to
embed a 2x2x2 cube in the center of the original solid cube, and use
it to hold the octants together.  Unfortunately, this method requires
an appeal to the existence of even-sided cubes, rather than teaching
us how to build them.

The other ways of finessing the center cut involve the thin-center-
slab approach.  You know you can simulate a 2x2x2 pocket cube with the
corners of a regular 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, and similarly you can
simulate any even cube with a larger odd cube.  Also, we can make that
center slab very thin, so it becomes part of the supporting structure
rather than a significant part of the cube.  We also remove the cor-
ners from the center slab, so it does not protrude from the cube.  We
may even make covers for the cubies slabs adjacent to the center, to
cover up the crack where the center slab lives.  We are ready to cube!

Or are we?  The thin-center-slab suffers from the partial-twist
problem.  We can see this in the simulation of the 2x2x2 by a 3x3x3.
If you try to simply ignore the center slabs, you can end up with the
corners being aligned with each other but with a center slab twisted
by 45 degrees.  This makes it impossible to turn the corners except in
the plane parallel to the oblique slab.  If we shrink the center slab
enough that it becomes unnoticeable, we will still be unable to twist
the cube except in one direction except by breaking the center slab.

The first solution to the partial-twist-problem is to select one of
the eight near-central cubies, a cubie that abuts the center slabs on
three sides.  We then glue the adjacent parts of the center slabs to
that cubie.  Then when we turn along the center slice(s), the glued
part of the thin center slab will follow the selected cubie, and will
push the rest of the thin center slab along.  This is a modification
of the solution that is taken inside Rubik's Revenge, as I described
to this group in my Invisible Revenge article of 9 August 1982.

I like this solution except for one thing.  It destroys the symmetry
of the cube, by selecting one specialized octant that the center slab
must follow.  There is one more solution, though, that keeps the cube
symmetric, which is *even* *sillier* than the thin center slab itself.
Let us now visualize the center slab.  It has the corners removed, so
it is in the shape of a disc.  The disc is cut in a grid pattern by
the cuts from perpendicular planes.  Now suppose we cut each slab in a
second grid pattern, with the grid at a 45 degree offset from the
original.  With such a center slab, the cube can be twisted if each
slab grid is in the correct position, or if some are at a 45 degree
offset from the correct position.

And how shall we prevent turns of less than a 45 degrees?  Gears!
Embed tiny gears in each fragment of the center slab, that contact
tiny toothed tracks in the adjacent slabs on both sides.  This will
force the center slab to turn at exactly half the angular rate of one
half of the cube with respect to the other.  Thus when the off-center
slabs of the cube are aligned, the center slab will be at one of the
positions that allows twisting.

Wow!  I could have sworn I have gotten to this position before, but you are
very definitely correct.  The state with two diagonal corners swapped is in
the orbit with edge cubies exchanged.

I think you must be wrong here (but would love to be proved wrong--I'm no
mathematician so group theory is very much beyond me).

Proof #1:
	We hold the cube with the red face on top, and the yellow face in
front (colors obviously don't matter, but I find it easier to discuss using
them).  We will assign a parity to the edge cubies, being defined by holding
the cube such that the red face of the cubie is on top and the yellow in
front.  If the cubie is on the left as we look at it in this position it is
parity 0, on the right it is parity 1.

	There are only two operations available which affect the cubie we
are interested in: rotating the front face 90deg; and rotating the slice the
cubie is in 90deg.  It is easy to see that neither of these moves alters the
parity (assume the cubie's frame of reference, and think of rotating the
rest of the cube around it--it is clear that it will not end up on the other
side).

	Therefore the move C->A in the above is impossible.

Proof #2:
	Take apart the order 4 cube (my falls apart depressingly easilly)
and try to reassemble it with the two edges exchanged.  It will not fit, as
they are mirror images of each other.



	Note that you get an apparant parity reversal by flipping the
cubies, but this does not actually move anything.  In other words, no amount
of flipping and moving will allow you to end up moving A->B->C->A.  That's
why I solve edges first.

Hi.

I think we're in complete agreement, at least up to here.  (I particularly
enjoyed your "proof by hardware ;).

I didn't mean to imply that the A->B->C->A operator preserved flipped-ness
of the Non-Central-Edge[NCE] Cubies.  Moreover, I was being imprecise
where I said "a NCE cubie is simply flipped"; rather "the cubie *appears*
as if it were in the right place (i.e. judged by its colors) and flipped".
As you point out, *really* means that it is in the slot of its "twin".

To recap more succinctly, what I was proposing was a rather pedestrian,
two-step solution to the original problem.  Starting from the initial
state in FIG1 (where the cube is completely "solved" except that the
cubies marked "O" are swapped.  Also they are swapped in such a way that
the visible face is all a single color).

FIG1: X|O|X|X|X                      FIG2: X|Q|X|Q|X
      X|X|X|X|X                  	   X|X|X|X|X
      X|X|X|X|X     A->B->C->A gives:      X|X|X|X|X
      X|X|X|X|X                  	   X|X|X|X|X
      X|X|X|O|X                  	   X|X|X|X|X

STEP1] If we then apply the A->B->C->A operator, we end up with the state
in FIG2, where the cube is completely "solved" except that the cubies
marked "Q" "appear" to be "simply" flipped.

STEP2] We can then solve this problem, which (imo) is easier.  For example
see the method that I described in an earlier post; this involves turning
the non-central plane (containing the flipped cubie) through a quarter turn.

Of course, now that I say it, it seems that the correct course would be to
*start* with the quarter turn of the non-central plane.  This would leave
five NCE cubies out of place, but the cube would be in the right orbit.
From there the solution should be straightforward (e.g. two intersecting
3-cycles).

Finally, it seems clear that this entire problem --and all the subsequent
discussion-- maps directly onto a virtually identical problem on the 4by
cube (i.e. simply be removing the center planes).

Again, perhaps I'm missing the point, but if you don't care about how
the flipping comes out, the A->B->C->A  3-cycle is certainly doable:

For example:

Message-Id:  <9105211103.aa16846@FSAC1.PICA.ARMY.MIL>




I would like help on finding info on the "BILINSKI" rhombic
dodecahedron.  

BACKGROUND:  The common rhombic dodecahedron is the  KEPLER and its
diagonals are in the ratio of 1:sqr rt of 2.   The Bilinski has its
diagonals in the ratio of 1:tau  (ie, the golden section ~ 1.618). 
 The only reference I have been able to find so far is on page 31 of
Coxeter's "Regular Polytopes".


AREAS OF INTEREST
..  Is there a proof of why there are only 2 rhombic dodecahedrons?
..  are there any interesting features of how the Bilinski fills
space?  Any interesting relationships with other polygons, eg,
triacontahedron?
..  Has anybody studied the dissections of the bilinski?  Is there any
significance that it takes both obtuse and acute rhomboids to
construct a bilinski while a kepler only requires an obtuse?
..  Is there a crystal or some other real world object that
corresponds to the bilinski?
..  Any ideas on fixturing/jigging to make bilinski's from wood?


Thanks for any help.

ANNONCEMENT OF "SLIDE" - A Sliding Block Puzzle Simulation Program

DESCRIPTION:  "SLIDE"  is a Sliding Block Puzzle Simulation Program
based on the book "Sliding Block Puzzles", by Ed Hordern, 1986 Oxford
University Press.  It comes on one 360K floppy with an instruction
booklet.  The booklet tells you how to install the program, how to use
it (program does have help files) and how to add your own puzzles.  It
is in color and REQUIRES a mouse to move the pieces.

It has all of hordern's puzzles including the background notes for
each, eg, name, producer.  The program gives you the minimum number of
moves, the object of the puzzle and a randomized version to test your
skill.

The version I have was obtained at the 11th International Puzzle Party
3/30/91 and is mostly bug free.  The author is in the process of
updating it and will make updates available at cost (for now anyhow).

I recommend  "SLIDE" for everyone with a PC who enjoyed Hordern's
book.

Subject:  last cube
Message-Id:  <9108010755.aa28998@FSAC1.PICA.ARMY.MIL>


The question was "where can I obatin the last cube made"

I am going to assume that last cube means "MAGIC POLYHEDRA", of
which there a three families:  the cube with 3 axis of rotation, the
tetrhedron group with 4 axis of rotation, the dodecahedron group
with 5 axis of rotation.

The last original addition I have seen was a spherical SKEWB, april 1991.
Jean Claude Constantine (germany) is making shape/surface variants by
hand based on all three mecahanisms, eg, take a 3x3x3 and join together
(make in operable) one 2x2x2 corner - you can now change those pieces shape
anyway you want - by the way this type of restriction on the moves available
to solve the cube are very interesting.  Also, in the spring of 1991
Christoph Bandelow has reintroduced the truncated octahedron and had the
Hong Kong factory complete from previously manufactured parts some 5x5x5's.

In my estimation there will NEVER be a last cube.

Solutions for all magic polyhedra, except the spherical skewb have been 
published.  First source is CFF ,cubism for fun newsletter of 
dutch cubists club,  some where also published in world game review.  
Puzzles popular when ideal was in business where also covered by many
popular publications which are now hard to get.  CFF has a library
and somebody has a bibliography of solution algorithms, including
Thistletwaites ??.

This is a general answer if there are specific questions please ask them!!

PS I sell much of this stuff and your US mail address will get you a listing
of what is available from me.

PPS I also collect this stuff and would like to trade and/or buy, any
quantity, ie, onesies to 100s.  Not only puzzles but all things a
associated with the cube - books, patents, solutions, accessories,
promotional items, replacement stickers, what have you.  a good overview
of this kind of stuff is in jerry slocum's book puzzles old and new.

       RUBIK RETURNS WITH MENTAL FITNESS GAMES

Remember Rubik's Cube, invented in 1977 by Hungarian professor of architecture
Erno Rubik?  Prof. Rubik is back with four "mental fitness" puzzles and a
redesigned version of the cube.

"One of the great misunderstandings surrounding Rubik's Cube was that I was
somehow trying to drive people crazy," Rubik says.  "In fact, the objective of
these puzzles is to help bring about a more alert and active mental condition."

Even if you can't solve the puzzles, according to Rubik, "the few moments
you've spent fiddling around with them has helped greatly in exercising your
mind and reducing everyday tensions."

Rubik's Tangle (suggested retail, $5.99), his first two-dimensional puzzle,
requires players to arrange 25 tiles of rope to create four continuous lines.

Rubik's XV ($6.99) is two puzzles in one.  The object of the first is to
arrange Roman numerals I through XV in order by sliding levers on the puzzle's
side.  In Part 2, players must create a square, lining up numbers so each
column, row and diagonal totals 15.

Rubik's Dice ($8.99) offers 82,575,360 possible combinations, with only one
correct answer.  The puzzle is a hollow cube with seven plates inside.  White
plates, which include red dots, are loose and can adhere to the inner sides of
the cube.  By shaking and turning the dice, players solve the puzzle when no
red appears through the holes.

Rubik's Triamid ($8.99) may be tougher than the original cube.  Players have to
construct a large pyramid, with each color on its own side, using 10 smaller
pyramids.  Rubik says there are "hundreds of blind alleys programmed into the
design."

All the puzzles are available nationally at game, toy and specialty stores.  In
Los Angeles, you can find them at Thrifty Drugs; in Orange County, at Toy City
and PlayCo stores.  Or you can order them by calling (800) 236-7123.

Subject: Re: New from Rubik

	Well I have the Rubik's XV and Rubik's pyramid.  The XV is a pretty
good puzzle (ie., I haven't solved it yet after trying for an hour or so).
The pyramid is essentially a Pyraminx.  The only complication beyond the
Pyraminx that the Pyramid offers is that the vertex tetrahedrons can be
rotated such that a useless color shows and a necessary color is hidden.

	The solution becomes trivial once you have solved the Pyraminx.  This
seems like a good place to save your money.

I found a fun new cube, sorta.

It is called Square 1.

it rotates in WIERD ways.

it is a challenge to return to the state of being a cube, much less to
solve it.

My friend calls it "unfriendly."

the way it is set up, it is a cube, with a center band that has one
split.  the two faces on either side of it that are split into the
normal three on a side, but the pieces meet at the center, i.e.: the
side ones are wedges, and the corners are almost-squares with the point
not on the outside being the center.

it is fun.

I was told it will be out at christmas, but I bought it in a store
called Games Unlimited in Squirrel Hill, a neighborhood of Pittsburgh. 
Buy one from someone, and fry your brain.

Enjoy.

True.  To solve it when it is a cube, knowledge of the magic domino is
sufficient.  But it might even be that restoring it to cube form is not
much more dificult than the magic domino.  I do not know yet.  When my
cube got in disorder, by some magical moves it was restored to cube form;
not by me, but by my 8 year old daughter, I still do not know how.

Something is missing from this description.  I think it can best be
explained based on the MagiBall that came some years ago from Austria.
The MagiBall consists of two halves that can be rotated with respect to each
other.  But only rotates of 180 degrees make sense.  Further it has four bands
of moving pieces.  Movement of the bands is perpendicular to the rotations
of the halves.  Each band has 8 pieces.  When the halves are rotated with
respect to each other, the "left" half of an upper band is connected to the
"right" half of a lower band.  This creates two puzzles, each with 16 pieces.
Now consider that ball; remove the inner two bands (leaving only the uppermost
and lowermost band).  Next go through the bands clockwards when you look from
above.  Alternatingly glue two pieces in a band together and skip a piece.
This will leave you in each band with four double size pieces.  Ignoring
the middle layer of the new cube, this is the new cube (but the middle layer
is easily dealt with).  Now what was missing from the description is that the
centre angle of a cornerpiece is exactly twice the center angle of a wedge.

I have some algorithms to do cycles on three corner pieces and also for
three wedge pieces.  The latter are fairly long however.  And they all only
work if the puzzle is already in cube form.

Subject: Square One


"Square One" is also available at Games People Play in Cambridge, Mass. 
I just purchased one a few days ago. It turned out to be more interesting 
than i had expected. The puzzle is comprised (essentially) of two halves 
of 8 pieces each, 4 corners, and 4 'edges'. All pieces radiate outward from 
the center. The 'edge' pieces expand outward at a 30 degree angle, while 
the corners expand outward at a 60 degree angle. The center layer is composed
of just 2 pieces. If you removed the top slice, the center slices would trace
out quadrilaterals ABIK and BDJL (or ACIJ and BDKL, etc) below.

The center slice serves no major function save as a "gate"
which allows or disallows rotation about one of the skewed axes formed by 
the two slices. To rotate about some axis you must line up the "gate" 
with the axis. While it is possible to swap the center pieces with respect 
to the corners frame of reference, doing so is really of no importance 
to the "meat" of the puzzle.

The neat thing about the puzzle is that moves do not necessarily preserve 
the cube shape of the puzzle, or even the number of corner/edge pieces 
that are on each side. It is possible, for instance, to have only 3 corners
on the top face, and 6 edges, while 5 corners and 2 edges are on the bottom 
face. 

A notation for this beast is somewhat cumbersome. If anyone wants, I will try 
to describe what i am using.

After playing with it for a few hours, i *thought* i had mapped out a complete
solution algorithm; however i was later playing with the wierd shapes you could
put the puzzle into, and eventually started putting it back to "Square One", 
and was very surprised to end up in a position with just 2 of the edges 
swapped! Since this puzzle acts much like the Skewb, each move essentially
cutting the puzzle in half (ignoring the gate layer), i did not expect this 
to be possible. It took a bit of thought before the light hit, and i went 
on to construct a crude "Parity Swap" transform. Currently the best one i have
found cycles around  UF -> UL -> UB -> UR, and takes 28 'moves'. (a 'move' 
being defined as any motion of some slice, regardless of degrees turned) 
Anyone else found anything better? 

Square One is one of the better variations on the cube theme i have seen 
in a long time. Find one and have fun.
