I too had wondered this...  and in what way was the solved cube 
'scrambled' for most of you cubists know that all scrambling is not 
equal...  I have found some of my quickest times involved arriving at the 
solution much sooner than expected by not needing to perform some 
auxiliary, but essential and long routines....   Could these world record 
times have been accomplished with random scrambling..... I have always 
pondered how fast I would have completed the cube if I was handed the 
'same' cube that Minh 'flew' on.... A move count would be very 
interesting indeed.... 

With the right equipment and a good copy of the world record video 
tape... it may be conceivable to actually count the moves.... 

In the Hey day of cubing, during a younger version myself, I also found 
by making a good guess at which way to solve the cube (ie.. Top to bottom 
or
top, bottom, then middle) I could easily cut a few seconds off my S.T. 
(solution time)...  but I can't for the life of me remember the 
criteria..
