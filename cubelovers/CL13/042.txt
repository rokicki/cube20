This is not a shift invariance question, but rather two
questions about your searches.  One question is, do you perform separate
searches for q-turns and h-turns, or only for h-turns?  The reason I
ask is the obvious fact that optimal processes in q-turns need not
contain h-turns.  The second question is, how on earth do you keep track
of all those processes in your searches?  I have been asked how I search
so many positions.  I have answered the question before, but I guess
another part of the answer that I haven't mentioned is that I don't
keep up with processes at all, only positions.  If I am asked to provide
processes, I can do so, but it is a very painful task.  I have thought
about keeping up with processes, but I am quite sure that if I did
so it would reduce the number of positions I could search.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
