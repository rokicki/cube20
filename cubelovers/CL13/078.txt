These are fine points, but they bother me anyway.

  1. Suppose I write <Q>=<Q,H>.  If I mean that the group <Q> is equal
     to the group <Q,H>, then the equation is correct.  If I mean that
     the Cayley graph of <Q> is the same as the Cayley graph of <Q,H>,
     then the equation is incorrect.  Which is the conventional meaning?
     Is the meaning universal, or does it depend on the author and the
     context?

  2. I gather from your note and from things that Dan sent me that
     one should not list inverses of the generators.  For example,
     <U,R> is sufficient and one should not write <U,U',R,R'>.  But
     people conventionally write <Q> which includes six processes and
     their six inverses.  Is this acceptable usage, or should we write
     <U,D,L,R,F,B> instead?

As an additional comment, I have frequently written about the Q length
of a process in <U,R> or the Q+H length of a process in <U,R>.  I think
we would be better served to talk about the length of a process in
<U,R> or the length of a process in <U,U2,R,R2> if the generator
notation implies a particular Cayley graph.
