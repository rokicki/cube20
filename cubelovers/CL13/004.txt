Subject:   Re: < U, R> Group (W-conjugate results)
In-Reply-To: Message of 08/09/94 at 01:48:00 from mark.longridge@canrem.com

I have completed the God's Algorithm calculations for the <U,R> group
in terms of W-conjugate classes (or really, in terms of representative
elements of W-conjugate classes), with the results below.  In general,
the use of W-conjugates reduces the size of the problem by about
four times.  However, I was surprised to see that for levels 1, 3, 5,
7, 9, and 11 the number of cubes was exactly four times larger than the
number of W-conjugate classes.  My interpretation is that all cubes
in <U,R> at these levels are completely "asymmetric" with respect to
W.  (They are somewhat symmetric with respect to M, of course.)  However,
when level 13 turned out not to have a ratio of exactly 4 between cubes
and W-conjugate classes, I was rescued from the task of explaining why
all cubes at an odd distance from Start were asymmetric.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
