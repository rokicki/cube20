Subject: Permutation Representations for Magic Polyhedra

Dan Hoey writes in his e-mail message of 1994/11/08

    Wow, I didn't realize this sort of calculation had been automated.

Hey, we do this stuff every day.  Really.
Well at least with a loose interpretation of ``this sort of''.

Dan Hoey continues

        gap-3.4 -b -g 4m 
        gap> Sum( ConjugacyClasses( M ),
        >     c -> Size( Centralizer(G,Representative(c)) ) / 48 * Size(c) );
        901083404981813616

    Well, call me John Henry.  Say, do you have gap libraries for other
    magic polyhedra?  For higher-dimensional magic?

I also have a permutation representation for the 2x2x2 and the 4x4x4
cube.  I must confess that I was never interested in other magic
polyhedra.

I once started writing a GAP function that creates a premutation
representation for any (hyper-)cube, i.e., 'Cube( 3, 3, 3, 2 )' would
create a 4-dimensional magic domino.  The largest problem was to define
what the ``faces'' and ``slices'' are, i.e., are they 2 or n-1
dimensional?

If there is interest, I would finish this project and also collect
permutation representations for other magic polyhedra and distribute
them together with future versions of GAP.

Have a nice day.

Martin.
