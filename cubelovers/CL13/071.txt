Subject: Models for the Cube

I wrote in my e-mail message of 1994/11/08

    The way I view this is as follows.  The entire cube group C is a
    permutation group group on 6*9 points, generated by the six face turns U,
    D, L, R, F, B; the three middle slice turns M_U, M_L, M_F; and the
    reflection S.  This group has a subgroup M of symmetries of the cube (of
    order 48), generated by U M_U D', L M_L R', F M_F B', and S.  Another
    subgroup is G, generated by the six face turns, which has index 48 in G.
    G is a normal divisor of C, G is the semidirect product of M and G.  The
    same is true for GE and GC.

    I have discussed a similar view of things recently, except that I was
    not brave enough to include a reflection in the generators.  C is
    normally used to denote the set of twenty-four rotations of the
    cube (a sub-group of M), so let's call your "entire cube group"
    big_G instead.  My version of big_G was generated by Q plus the
    slice moves (like yours without the reflection), or alternatively
    by Q plus C.  Your version of big_G is hence the same as the one
    I discussed except that you added a reflection.  C (the rotations C,
    that is) is a sub-group of both versions of big_G.  M is a sub-group
    of your version of big_G, but not of mine.

    Your big_G has the obvious advantage of including M as a sub-group.
    Mine has the advantage (?) of being physically realizable on a
    real cube.  That is, for X in your big_G, rX or Xr (r is a reflection)
    is also in your big_G.  For X in my big_G, rX or Xr is not in
    big_G, and correspondingly a single reflection is not physically
    realizable on a real cube.  Of course, r'Xr is in big_G in either
    case, r being in M.  Also, cX and Xc are in either version of big_G
    for all c in C.

OK, I guess I have to be a little bit more precise and also to adapt
my terminology to common usage.  First a picture.

The maximal cube group *MG* is a permutation group on 6*9 points.
It is generated by the six face turns < U, D, L, R, F, B >, the three
rotations of the entire cube < u, l, f >, and the reflection < x >.

The complete cube group *CG*, generated by < U, D, L, R, F, B > and
< u, l, f >, is a subgroup of MG of index 2.

The cube group *G*, generated by < U, D, L, R, F, B >, is a subgroup of
index 24 in CG.  G can be viewed as a permutation group on 48 points,
since it fixes the 6 center cubies.

The group *M* of symmetries of the entire cube, generated by < u, l, f >
and < x >, is a subgroup of MG of size 48.

The group *C* of rotations of the entire cube, generated by < u, l, f >,
is a subgroup of CG of size 24.

(I would have preferred S instead of M and R instead of C, but M and C
are too widely used to change that notation.  Of course MG is not called
MG because it is the maximal cube group, but as a reminder that it is the
product of M and G.  Likewise for CG.)

Jerry continues

    I tend to think that Singmaster's standard G=<Q> is not what people
    think of when they hold a real cube in their hand.  Rather, they
    tend to think of big_G/C.  That is, the cosets of C in big_G are
    common sensically considered to be equivalent because rotating
    a real cube in space is "doing nothing".  Also, for my version
    of big_G we have |big_G/C| = |G|.

True, what people really see is the complete cube group CG (what you call
big_C).  That is, patterns corresponding to two different elements of CG
are distinct.  Now if two patterns can be made equal by rotations of the
entire cube, they ``look alike'' and most people feel that they are
equivalent since rotations ``cost nothing''.  Especially they feel that
any pattern corresponding to an element in C is solved.  Mathematically
we describe this equivalence by saying that all 24 elements in each coset
of C are equivalent.

Unfortunately C is *not* a normal subgroup of CG, and therefore CG/C is
*not* a group.  If we want to apply group theory, we need a better model.
I argue that G is indeed a good model for the 3x3x3 cube.

First note that for each coset of C in CG, there is exactly one element
of G in this coset.  This follows since C and G together generate CG and
have trivial intersection.  We call this element the representative in G
of the coset.  Thus G is a set of representatives for the cosets of C in
CG.  In group theory terminology G is a *supplement* for C (if C was a
normal subgroup, then G would be called a complement of C).  An immediate
consequence is that |G| = |CG| / |C|.

Next note that, if we assume that rotations ``cost nothing'' and middle
slice turns cost (at least) twice as much as face turns, then any two
elements in a coset of C have the same *cost*, i.e., distance from the
solved cube, and this is equal to the cost of the representative in G.

This is a simple consequence of the fact that we can transform each
process p_1 p_2 ... p_l, where each p_i is either a face turn or a
rotation of the entire cube, into one which has a single rotation of the
entire cube first and then only face turns afterwards.  This can be done
using the rule <face-turn> <rotation> => <rotation> <another-face-turn>,
which obviously doesn't change the cost of the process (remember
rotations cost nothing).

Finally note that G's structure as a group is in a certain sense CG
without C.  Namely G is a normal subgroup of CG, and the factor group
CG/G is isomorphic to C.  Ideally we would like to have G be isomorphic
to CG modulo C, but this is not well defined, as C is not a normal
subgroup.  Put another way, CG is the semidirekt product of G with C.

Unfortunately the existence of this model is particular to the 3x3x3
cube.  It does not work as well for other cubes.

First take the 2x2x2 cube group CG_2 (I use a _2 to distinguish the 2x2x2
subgroups from their 3x3x3 counterparts).  Again we have a subgroup C_2,
generated by the rotations, of size 24.  But the subgroup G_2, generated
by the six face turns, is in fact equal to CG_2.  In particular it is not
a supplement to C_2.

But we can make a similar construction.  Namely in the case of the 3x3x3
we can view CG as generated by the six face turns and the three middle
slice turns < M_U, M_D, M_F > (instead of the six face turns and the
three rotations < u, d, f >).  And our supplement G was the subgroup of
CG generated by 6 of those 9 generators, were the 3 removed ones are
pairwise perpendicular.  In the case of the 2x2x2 cube we can take the
subgroup H_2 that is generated by three turns < U, L, F >.  Using the
transformations <face-turn> <rotation> => <rotation> <another-face-turn>
and D => u' U, R => l' L, B => f' F, we can again transform any process
into one which has a single rotation first and then only < U, L, F >
turns afterwards, without changing the cost of the process (again
rotations cost nothing).

Thus H_2, of size 7!*3^6, is a good model to use when one is looking for
God's algorithm for the 2x2x2 cube.  Nothing of this is really new, I
have just casted it into a different language.  For example see
'http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de:8000/~mschoene/Cube-Lovers/
Jerry_Bryan__God's_Algorithm_for_the_2x2x2_Pocket_Cube.html'.

But H_2 is *not* normal, and is not CG_2 without C_2 (in the sense in
which G was CG without C).  For example CG_2 has a factor group
isomorphic to S8, but there is no such factor in H_2.

Things get worse when we look at the nxnxn cube groups CG_n.  We can find
again find a supplement H_n for C_n, if we leave out three pairwise
perpendicular slice turns.  If n is odd and if we leave out the three
middle slice turns, then H_n is again a normal subgroup (and in the same
sense as above, it is again CG_n without C_n).  On the other hand if n is
even then H_n is never a normal subgroup.  Moreover if 3 < n, then the
transformation rules tell us to replace one of the removed slice turns by
a rotation and the product of the n-1 parallel slice turns.  Thus the
transformation would only respect the cost, if we assume that the removed
three slice turns have cost n-1.  While this is arguably true for n = 3,
where most people feel that the middle slice turns have cost 2, I don't
think anybody feels that for the 4x4x4 cube nine of the slice turns have
cost 1 and 3 have cost 3.

And now for something completely different (no, not really ;-).

I have argued that G is a good model for the 3x3x3 cube assuming that
rotations of the entire cube cost nothing, and that middle slice turns
have cost 2 (or higher).  In a certain sense, we got rid of C.  That
doesn't mean we can't use C anymore.  In fact, C is still very useful.

Namely let c be any element of C, and g be any element of G.  Then c' g c
is another element of G, because G is a normal subgroup.  Moreover the
cost of c' g c is the same as the cost of g.  This is trivial because
each process effecting g can be turned into a process effecting c' g c,
by replacing each generator x in this process by c' x c.

But C is not the largest such group.  The largest such group is M, i.e.,
the full group of symmetries of the entire cube.  This is the reason why
I prefer to view G as a subgroup of MG, which is the semidirekt product
of M and G, even though I realize that MG is not physically realizable.

Have a nice day.

Martin.
