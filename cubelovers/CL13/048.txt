I have a symbolic cube program, which I didn't write (written by
raymond@cps.msu.edu).  It does pretty much what you want, although I'm
not too sure how portable it is.  It was written in C, using yacc and flex (lex
doesn't work on it tho, go figure.)

I could post it to the group, or send it to individuals that wanted it.
