Subject:   <U,R> Q vs. Q+H Distances from Start

The fact that there is only one position in <U,R> which is antipodal
for both Q moves and Q+H moves got me to thinking more generally about
the Q distance from Start as compared to the Q+H distance from Start
for any position.  Here follows a cross-tabulation table giving the
number of positions in <U,R> unique up to W-conjugacy which are m moves
from Start under Q and n moves from Start under Q+H.

The table has some interesting features.  The main diagonal contains
powers of 2 for distances from zero to nine.  Other entries in the
upper left portion of the table (close to Start) are often small
primes times powers of 2.  There are positions where allowing Q+H
moves saves nine moves (from nineteen down to ten), which is a
substantial savings in moves.  There is one "discontinuity" in the
table; a position which is 25 moves from Start under Q may be 20,
19, 18, 17, or 15 moves from Start under Q+H, but not 16 moves from
Start.  The longest "common distance" is nineteen;  there are
positions which are nineteen moves from Start under both Q and Q+H,
but for twenty moves and above there are no positions which are
a common distance from Start.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
