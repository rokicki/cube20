Subject: Solution..
X-Mailer: XGATE 2.12 MHS/SMTP Gateway

I have been able to solve the Cube in under a minute... but that was 
years ago when my reflexes and memory was better in Junior High... now I 
pull the old cube out for limbering the fingers... and seeing how much I 
remember the solutions... now they are so ingrained in me... I no longer 
remember them as separate moves.... but a conglomeration of twists and 
turns... 

the book --the title I can't remember-- I originally learned from, showed 
the solution as a TOP to BOTTOM approach... doing the first top layer... 
then the center edges... and then completing the last layer...  I noticed 
then Mihn used the top, bottom, middle approach... when he won the 
World's Cube solving championship on the show 'THAT"S INCREDIBLE', which 
was also advocated by the solution book that was available from the 
address that was included with the original cubes...

so then I was able to solve it either way... finding the latter approach 
a little faster...  now the Revenge I can solve in about 5 minutes... 
maybe quicker, but I never really bothered to accurately time myself... I 
only learned the one way to solve the 4x4x4 cube... from Mihn's book.

Now since I joined this mailing list I have been inundated with all these 
algorithms.... how do I translate them?  Being a neophyte to cube 
'theory' its pretty frustrating trying to figure out what all the letters 
and numbers mean... and what they are trying to achieve....

can anyone help?

thanks in advance...
