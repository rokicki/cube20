I too, have read the book, Jeff Conquers The Cube in 45 seconds, as well as Minh
Thai's book on the cube (he's the world record holder, with 22 seconds as an
official world record.  I used to compete back in the cubing days, and could
regularly get under 25 seconds, using a strategy of solving the corners,
solving the edges on two opposite sides, followed by the middle slice.

Several people on this mailing list have done serious analysis trying to reach
"God's Algorithm", which isn't terribly useful to me.  The operators that these
analyses generate are really slow to crank out on the cube.  I prefer slightly
longer ones, that are more optimized for speed (hand positions, etc).
