Are you applying Kociemba's algorithm to the <U,R> antipodal positions
in the context of <U,R> or in the context of G?  The lengths of these
antipodal positions are already known to be minimal in <U,R>.
However (and obviously), the length in <U,R> can only be claimed to
be an upper bound for the length in G without further testing in G.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
