        The way I view this is as follows.  The entire cube group C is a
        permutation group group on 6*9 points, generated by the six face
        turns U, D, L, R, F, B; the three middle slice turns M_U, M_L,
        M_F; and the reflection S.  This group has a subgroup M of
        symmetries of the cube (of order 48), generated by U M_U D',
        L M_L R', F M_F B', and S.  Another subgroup is G, generated by
        the six face turns, which has index 48 in G.  G is a normal
                                                  ^
        divisor of C, G is the semidirect product of M and G.  The same is
                      ^
        true for GE and GC.

    I think two of those G's are supposed to be C's, right?

Correct (wouldn't make any sense for a group G to be a subgroup in itself
of index 48 ;-).

Dan Hoey continues

    As for when I wrote

        M class             Edge         Corner       Corner times edge
          (class size)      F.P.          F.P.             / (96*class size)
                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    That's not a typo.  I was just saying that column 4 is equal to column
    2 times column 3, divided by column 1, divided by 96.  Perhaps I
    should have factored column 1 out of columns 2 and 3 first to avoid
    this confusion.

Again you are correct.  But it was confusing, at least to me.

Have a nice day.

Martin.
