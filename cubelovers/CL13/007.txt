Alas, no antipodes yet, but some interesting results nonetheless.
Process UR8 improves on the best known process for a certain
quad-twist in the U layer at 20 q turns. Table 3 in Winning Ways
gives a 22 q turn process.

The following results should be particularly interesting to
the physical cube solver as it is easier to execute a sequence
of 2 adjacent sides compared to a sequence using 3 or more
sides, which may require some re-orienting of the cube. I will
measure the "face index" of a process by the number of different
sides used in a certain cube sequence. Such a measure could be
used to evaluate the relative elegance of two equally long
processes with respect to their face indices.

Well, that reminds me of one of the hardest patterns that Dik Winter
tried to find an optimal sequence for:

p141a alternate method   F1 R1 L2 U3 R2 L3 U3 D2 R2 F1 D1 B1 D1 F2 U3
of Superfliptwist + 6 X        R3 D3 F2 D2 L2
**This process was one of the hardest ever to reduce to 20 moves,
requiring  over 19 hours on an SGI R4K Indigo, 28 q turns**

My own $.02 worth is that an antipode for the full group of the 3x3x3
cube is probably deeper than an antipode for the < U, R > group.

        ----------------------------

11. |<U, R2, L2>|              = 2^12 3^4 5^2 7   =             58060800
12. |<U2, R, L2>|              = 2^12 3^4 5^2 7   =             58060800
17. |<U, R2, F2>|              = 2^8 3^5 5^2 7    =             10886400
21. |<U, R2, L2, D2>|          = 2^13 3^4 5^2 7   =            116121600
22. |<U, R2, L2, D>|           = 2^15 3^4 5^2 7^2 =           3251404800

I welcome any proposed < U, R > group antipodes. I haven't really
looked for anything exotic like < U, R > positions which are
shift invariant, or even if such a beast is possible!

Of course I already mentioned that...

        U2 R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 = R2 U2 R2 U2 R2 U2

...but aside from that nothing comes to mind.

Generally when there are elements which occur in both the square's
group AND the < U, R > group the latter is the shorter in q turns.
