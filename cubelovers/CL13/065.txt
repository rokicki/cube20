Subject:   Antipodes Revisited

I received the following from David Singmaster, forwarded with
permission.

>        I thought I remembered that antipodes is actually singular!  In fact
>it is singular in Greek but English recognizes both antipodes and antipode.
>But the Antipodes means the region on the earth opposite to where one is and
>is construed as a plural though its sense is singular.  So antipodes is
>actually not too bad a word for all the points which are maximally far away
>and antipode should be reserved for the case where there is a unique
>maximally distant point.

Prior to my first post on this subject, I consulted a mathematics
dictionary.  This time, I consulted an English dictionary as well.
It indicates that "antipode" is a back formation from the Greek
"antipodes", and that the pronunciation is anglicized as "AN-ti-POHD".
There is a separate entry for "antipodes". (It seems unusual for a
dictionary to have a separate entry for a plural form.)  The plural
pronunciation retains its Greek form as "an-TIP-uh-DEEZ".
