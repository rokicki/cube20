Subject: SYMBOLIC PROGRAMS

I couldn't quickly get a LEX or FLEX working to process the source
of the symbolic cube program written by Carl Raymond
(raymond@cps.msu.edu).  Carl's note said "do what you want...",
so, I did.

I managed to convert his C-and-LEX cube program into REXX.  You
type in a move sequence and it displays the resulting cycle
structure.  Exactly what I have always wanted.  I am still
testing it and working the bugs out, but now I can return to
my "cube research" (that is, playing around).

If anyone else needs such a straightforward text-mode cube program
in REXX (instead of C), let me know and I will share it with you...
after a little more testing.  (Contact me directly, not in this
group.)  Interpreted REXX is built in on OS/2, VM, MVS, and is
available (somewhere) for Unix systems, Amiga, and probably others.

A million thanks to Carl.
