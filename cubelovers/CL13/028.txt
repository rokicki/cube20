Subject:   Re: Speed Cubing
In-Reply-To: Message of 10/27/94 at 21:57:00 from mark.longridge@canrem.com

Has any analysis of speed cubing been performed in the sense of how
many twists were performed?  How many twists does somebody accomplish
in under 45 seconds or in 22.95 seconds?  For example, you might
video tape somebody and replay it in slow motion.  It would still be
hard to get an accurate count, I think.  You would have to ignore
whole cube rotations, and it might be hard to distinguish between
half and quarter turns, plus somebody might be using slice moves.
But if such an analysis *could* be done, it would be interesting to
to compare the results to what is known mathematically about
God's Algorithm.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
