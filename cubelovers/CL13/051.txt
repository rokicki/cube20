The cube lovers archives contain over two megabytes of readable
discussions on the cube.  In the interests of keeping them readable, I
ask that binary files and programs be distributed using some other
channel: private email, ftp, web, or whatever.  Please let Cube-Lovers
remain a _discussion_ list for cube topics.

I am aware that alternative distribution methods are not supplied
by Alan Bawden in his maintenance of the Cube-Lovers list and
archives.  Please consider that encouragement to provide such
methods, rather than an excuse to use this list for the purpose.

I am also aware that the recent program was not much larger than some
of the discussion articles on the list.  Nonetheless, it does not
contribute to the discussion, and imposes a burden on those of us who
subscribe for the discussion.  The revised versions and larger
programs to follow would impose a growing burden on the list.
