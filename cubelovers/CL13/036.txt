The best current algorithm has a proven upperbound of 37 turns (q
and h).  God's Algorithm is probably much shorter.  In fact the
program that implements Kociemba's algorithms has not yet found
a configuration (out of many thousands random configurations
tested) that could not be solved in 20 turns or less.  If we look
at distributions for similar puzzles it is expected that more than
one in three configurations requires the maximum number of turns
minus 1 or 2.  So I expect God's Algorithm to be at most 22 turns.
Still a long way to go.
