Subject: Group Slang in Cube Lovers

Dan Hoey and Jerry Bryan remind me, that not everybody reading my
messages does group theory everyday.  So the technical slang in my
messages will not be intelligable to everybody (or in the worst case
it will not be intelligable to anybody, including myself ;-).

If this happens, please *do ask*.  Almost everthing I write is simple.
If you don't understand it, it is not your fault, it is mine, since I
wasn't clear enough.  If you do ask, I will try to explain everything.

However, I must ask you to understand that my work and my family leave
very little free time for such leisures.  So it may take me some time to
answer your questions.

Have a nice day.

Martin.
