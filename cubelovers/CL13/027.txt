The "official" world record was set by Minh Thai at the 1982 World
Championships in Budapest Hungary, with a time of 22.95 seconds.

Keep in mind mathematicians provided standardized dislocation patterns
for the cubes to be randomized as much as possible.

I think the Guiness Book of Records dropped the entry in the 1985
edition due to the fact that the contests all dried up.

Interestingly David Allen, the #2 cubist in the United States, also
uses the Jeff Varasano method. I met him in Buffalo NY in the
a regional American Cube-a-thon on Sept 18, 1982. (Yes, that long
ago!)

Did you enter any of the tournaments Derek?

I can't agree entirely. I use computer generated sequences for a lot
of patterns and I find them quite useable in some cases. Also the
< U, R > group processes only use 2 sides, and those I can do
without moving the cube in space. Usually I rotate them in
space first.
