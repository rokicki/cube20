Continuing the previous discussion on shift invariance...

...or (U1 R1)^35 ? And indeed, (U1 R1)^(35 * 40) is shift invariant.
I meant to say (and should have said):

 "This is the longest optimal process I've found so far."

 Although I was inspecting (U1 R1)^N patterns in the quest for shift
invariance, (U1 R1)^35 = (R1 U1)^35 escaped me. In fact it was my
mistaken belief that the < U , R > group had no shift invariant
processes.

 I did not realize the connection between the centre of a group and
shift invariance until Martin's message of Mon Oct 24 17:10:27 1994.
I actually did use GAP on the < U, R > group but I couldn't resolve
the resulting position (can GAP use letters? I should have used
letters).

The missing insight was realizing that, although the full group had
a unique centre, other subgroups have different centres.

So without further adieu:

6 Counterclockwise Twist,
Equivalent to (U1 R1)^35= (R1 U1)^35 & Shift Invariant
UR11 = U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3 U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3
       (22 q  or  20 h  moves)

(U3 R3)^35 would execute a 6 clockwise twist.

Is this odd due to ( U1 R1 )^35?
Actually everything about the above description appears even.
It is an even number of quarter turns...

 I concur completely, although the all-commuting 12-flip is definitely
interesting too. I was surprised to see the process was shift invariant.

Martin writes:

For which I refer to the process UR11, 22 q turns.

 Martin, you will be pleased to hear that I like GAP, but I need a
bigger hard drive for that beast!
