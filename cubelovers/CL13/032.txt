  what is the diameter of the group of 3X3X3  rubiks cube rotations?
  ie. the longest cyclic subgroup.  what is the shortest path
  to solved?

  also I thought that red-orange   blue-white   yellow-green
  was standard.  all the ideal manufacturede c ubes were this way.

  and the two orientations available with the above colouring
  are not only an inconvienience  --Dr. Hana Bizek at
  ARgonne NAtional LAbs has used these two parities to do 
  veery intersesting cube sculptures or designs as she calls
   them
