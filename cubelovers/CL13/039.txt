   I hate posting this message to the entire list, but how do you
   unsubscribe from this list?

As I reminded everybody just last weekend, 
so you can't say you didn't see it:

  Please note that Cube-Lovers-Request is processed by a human being, not a
  computer program (such as LISTSERV or Majordomo).  If your request is not
  instantly processed, it is because I don't spend my entire life reading my
  electronic mail.  I do know how to interpret many of the commands typically
  sent to such programs, but I would prefer it if instead you can remember to
  address me in complete sentences.

Your request to unsubscribe was sent to me less than 24 hours ago.
I'm sorry I didn't drop everything just to deal with it.  How about if I do
it later on this evening?  Can you wait that long?
