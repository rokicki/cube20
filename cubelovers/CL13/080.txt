here you're using  "<Q>"  to denote the group.

but now you're trying to use the same symbol to denote the cayley graph.

the context should make it clear which object (group or graph) the symbols
refer to.  as martin notes above, these are quite different objects.

either is acceptable, whether you're referring to groups or cayley graphs.

however, for cayley digraphs (directed graphs), the two meanings are quite
different.  i don't imagine we'll have anything to do with digraphs until
someone complains that they can only turn the faces of their cube clockwise,
and wants to know some short processes.

in our case,  "<Q>"  is preferred, since it's shorter.

yes, this terminology is more precise, but the meaning was already clear.
