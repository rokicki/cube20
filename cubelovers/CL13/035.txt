Subject:   Speed Cubing Path Lengths

I have received several private E-mail messages indicating that
the algorithms used by speed cubists solve the cube in 50 or
60 moves.  On the one hand, that seems astonishingly good to me,
being fairly close to the solutions from early Thistlethwaite
programs.  On the other hand, it is roughly double (depending, I
suppose on whether H-turns are counted or not) what is probably
the true God's Algorithm.  Hence, it doesn't tell us much about
God's Algorithm except that the speed cubists are very, very
good.

On another subject, my Cube Theory 101 article said that the
apostrophe was used in E-mail to denote complements, when of
course it is used to denote inverses  --  not the same thing
as complements at all.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
