Notice that using Q+H turns instead of Q turns reduces the maximum
distance from Start from 25 down to 20.

When I first calculated God's Algorithm for <U,R> for Q turns, I calculated
it for cubes first, then for W-conjugate classes.  In this case, I
really did it only for W-conjugate classes (problem is four times
smaller).  The "Number of Cubes" column is then derived by calculating
the size of each W-conjugate class; no real search is needed to
obtain the number of cubes if the W-conjugate classes are already
in hand.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
