this is not hard to see.  the center of the slice group has order 32.
if we hold the corners fixed, then these central elements are exactly
those for which the six face-centers are correct.

i'm sure that GAP can do these.  you're interested in knowing about
the orders of centralizers of various elements.  for an element
g  in a group  G , we have

            |G| / |Z(g)|  =  number of conjugates of  g .

this is because the cosets  G / Z(g)  are in one-to-one correspondence
with the conjugates of  g.  of course, this doesn't help much unless
we know about conjugacy classes in  G.

in the case of the cube group, however, conjugacy classes are easy to
understand.  they are (almost) completely described by cycle structure.
(some cycle structures have two conjugacy classes.)  there are many
different possible cycle structures, but for each it should be easy to
count the number of elements with that cycle structure (and also to
tell whether they comprise a single conjugacy class or split into two).
