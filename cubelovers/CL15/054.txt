Subject: solving the cube?
Content-Length: 339

I just can't figure out how to solve the rubiks cube. Is there a simple way
to solve it?  I know my cousin had a pattern to follow and it would work
every time, but I haven't seen him in years and can't remember the pattern.

Please reply if you know the answer.
