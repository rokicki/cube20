   Sirs ,I am sorry to bother you with junck mail,
   but I wish to join Cube-Lovers.
   And I have written to you two or three times at the address 
   cube-lovers-REQUEST@life.ai.mit.edu and each time after a delay of a No. 
   of days I got the response that my mail hadn't been delivered since you 
   cuoldn't be found.
   Now I know you may not appreciate a new user littering your mail boxes 
   with junk mail but I don't know any other way to join in--please excuse me.

   Yours sincerely
		  Patrick


I added your subscription a week ago.  You even -responded- to one message
I sent you, so I know that you -can- send mail to Cube-Lovers-Request.

DO NOT SEND ANY FURTHER MESSAGES TO CUBE-LOVERS AS A WHOLE OR YOUR
SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE TERMINATED.

If you are experiencing trouble receiving Cube-Lovers mail, your only
recourse is to complain to -me-, Cube-Lovers-Request -- I will try my best
to help you.  If, for some reason, you are unable to send mail to the
-Request address, then you are simply screwed -- it will -never- do you any
good to send mail to the entire mailing list about list administration.

Everybody please note that the correct administrative address is:

  Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU

Some mail programs will re-write mail headers to make it look as though the
address is "cube-lovers-request@life.ai.mit.edu", but it isn't.
