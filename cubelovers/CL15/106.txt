Subject: Rubik's Robot

At the IPC show, a trade show for industrial controls held in Detroit this
week, Kawasaki had a Rubik's cube solving robot.  The robot has two arms and
hands and a video camera.  The robot is handed a scrambled cube, orients the
cube in front of the camera until it has seen enough faces to deduce the
current state of the cube; displays the number of moves required for its
solution; and then solves the cube using both hands (grippers).  The robot
is capable of manipulating the entire cube using only its hands, without
relying on anything else such as a flat surface.  Unfortunately, I missed
the show so this information was obtained second hand.
