If I understand your definition of "P" correctly, the same group is
called X1 in Dan's taxonomy.  X2 similarly preserves the F-B
axis, and X3 similarly preserves the R-L axis.  Hence, there are
three conjugate subgroups of G which preserve a major axis, and
each contains 128 elements:  there are 128 X1-symmetric positions,
128 X2 symmetric positions, and 128 X3 symmetric positions.

I was bothered by your statement that there were 128 P-symmetric
positions at first because I was equating "P-symmetric" with
"X-symmetric" rather than with "X1-symmetric".  There should be
376 X-symmetric positions  --  124 that are X1-symmetric and not
M-symmetric, 124 that are X2-symmetric and not M-symmetric, 124
that are X3-symmetric and not M-symmetric, and 4 that are M-symmetric.
