Subject:   Pons Asinorum Superflipped Halfway Positions (corrected)

As Mike Reid pointed out, the sequences were backwards.  The error was
a human error on my part interpreting the output of the backtracking
program which converted positions to processes.  The error occurred
when I moved the output of the program to E-mail.  Each individual
qturn operator needs to be inverted as in the following corrected table.

 1. L  R' D  R' L  F' R  B  U  F
 2. L  R' D  R' L  F' U  F  R  B
 3. U  D' L  D' U  F' D  B  R  B
 4. F  B' U' F  B' D  F  L  D  B
 5. U  D' F' U  D' R  B' R' U' R'
 6. U  D' L  D' U  F' R' B' D' B'
 7. F  B' L' F  B' D  F  D  R  D
 8. F  B' L' F  B' D  R  U  F  D
 9. U  D' B  U  D' L' D' L' F' R'
10. B' B' F' U  D' R' F' D' B' U'
