Subject: Re: The Pyraminx Lost

I have never seen the Pyraminx.  I wonder if somebody could tell me
whether the picture I put together from the various comments made about
the Pyraminx is correct?

I am fairly certain that the Pyraminx is a regular tetrahedron.  In the
solved state each of the four faces shows only one of the four colours.

I think the Pyraminx is cut along 8 planes, two planes perpendicular to
each of the four heights (i.e., the four lines that connect a corner with
the center of the opposite face).  I think for the Pyraminx those planes
intersect the height at about 2/5 and 3/5 of the length of the height.

Those planes cut the Pyraminx into 15 pieces (1 central piece, 4 corners,
4 inner pieces, and 6 edes), which are all visible.  Each face is cut
into 10 facelets by them as follows.

                   +
                  / \
                 /   \
                /     \
               /       \
              /         \
             +-----------+
            / \         / \
           /   \       /   \

       /     \     +     /     \

The Pyraminx Star was descibred as a Pyraminx without the centers.
So I guess each face of the Pyraminx Star looks as follows.

                   +
                  / \
                 /   \

               /       \
              +---------+
             / \       / \
            /   \     /   \
           /     \   /     \
          /       \ /       \
         +---------*---------+
        / \       / \       / \
       /   \     /   \     /   \
      /     \   /     \   /     \
     /       \ /       \ /       \

The Pyraminx Snub was described as a Pyraminx without the tips.
So I guess each face of the Pyraminx Snub looks as follows.

             +-----------+
            / \         / \
           /   \       /   \
          +-----+-----+-----+
           \     \   /     /
            \     \ /     /
             \     +     /
              \   / \   /
               \ /   \ /
                +-----+

I have no idea what Pyraminx Senior and the Pyraminx Master look like.

Have a nice day.

Martin.
