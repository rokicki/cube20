Well, I figure Jerry is correct and so I kept looking for the magic
pattern which transforms 4 ways...

Number of
different      Pattern
patterns        -------
---------

...
 4              6 flip (UF, UR, FR, DB, DL, BL)
...

So there are 4 types of this 6 flip.

Jerry has said before:

That sounds harder. Looks like I am specifying only the index of
the symmetry subgroup... perhaps it makes sense to find out
exactly which subgroup of M is the symmetry group of my positions.

It all sounds vaguely familar.... but it will try again tomorrow.
