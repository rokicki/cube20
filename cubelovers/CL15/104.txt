 I have a complaint to make about the way mr. Allan Bawden treats cube 
-lovers.
1)Alot of people are not sure how to join a group when they start out to 
join one. In fact in most cases the people are new to the Internet , and 
in order to learn how to do things in the famous net , they can join a news 
group .
(I am not sugesting that joining a news group teaches them about the 
internet but its one of the things they can do)
2)Now if Mr Allan responds to their mistakes very rudly ,e.g

3)"you're the third idiot--" etc I mean one gets quite upset about the 
whole thing and one begins to question if it's worth it joining the news 
group if they are so rude.
I can assure you it's a good thing we communicate by computer, because a 
lot of harm might have been caused on the person of Mr. Allan were he 
speaking straight to a person---I'm sure he does'nt speak that way to 
anyone (even to his kids should he be married with children)
4)I sugest Mr. Allan be firm but polite . It's best to keep the 
correspondence bussness - like. In that way we still remain friends ,and 
quite understand what is expected of us to do.

5) It sounds like Mr. Allan thinks that the qube member doesn't think. 
For people interested in cubing thats an insult. We think of ourselves as 
people who can think --on an overage better than most people.
