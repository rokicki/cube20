Looking back through my records, I find that when you asked to be added to
Cube-Lovers back in February, you sent your subscription request to the
entire mailing list.  At the time I explained to you that subscription
requests should be sent to Cube-Lovers-REQUEST -- and that this is in fact
an Internet-wide convention.  In fact, the greeting message I sent you
contained the following text:

   REMEMBER: Our addresses are Cube-Lovers@AI.MIT.EDU for submissions and
   Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.  Save this message
   somewhere so you don't forget about Cube-Lovers-Request.  If you ever
   want to be -removed- from Cube-Lovers, your request should be sent to
   Cube-Lovers-Request.  If you forget, and send mail concerning your
   subscription to the entire list again, you should expect to be severely
   chastised -- that mistake is considered particularly annoying by
   Internet old-timers.

So here you are, only a month later, screwing up in public -- a
particularly pathetic example of inability to follow simple directions.

To the rest of you on Cube-Lovers: The paragraph quoted above is now sent
to -all- new subscribers (and now all you old-timers have seen it as well),
so don't make the mistake that Greg did -- send your administrative
requests to -me- (Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU).  If you don't, I have
now given you fair warning that I will feel perfectly free to hold you up
for public ridicule!
