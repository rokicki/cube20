I am taking the liberty of CC'ing Cube-Lovers as well.  A search tree
giving distances from Start calculates d(I,IY) for all positions IY
in the domain of inquiry.  With an X-rooted tree, distances are of
the form d(X,XZ) for all positions XZ in the domain of inquiry.
In general, it is not the case that d(I,IY)=d(X,XY).  Hence,
we cannot simply take Z=Y, and elements of the form XY do not produce
the X-rooted tree.  Therefore, to perform
two half-depth searches to connect I and X, you really do have to
construct a standard Start-rooted tree as well as an X-rooted tree.
You are looking for a position IY=XZ such that |IY|=|XZ|=|X|/2.

However, in the case of the Superflip E, it is the case that
d(I,IY)=d(E,EY).  Hence, in order to construct an
E-rooted tree, it is sufficient to calculate all elements of
the form EY from your existing I-rooted tree of the form IY.

Yes, I am storing only M-conjugate-class representatives, but that
isn't the problem (see above).  However, it does make the processing
a bit less trivial than I have indicated.  For every Y in the
Start-rooted tree, I first form EY, then {m'(EY)m}, and finally
Repr{m'(EY)m}.  These representatives are sorted and then compared
against all the Y's (which are themselves representative elements,
of course).  We are looking for some V and W such that
Repr{m'(IV)m}=Repr{m'(EW)m}, and this will be a "half-way" position.
What I *really* want is some V such that Repr{m'(IV)m}=Repr{m'(EV)m}.
It seems to me that all half way positions should be "symmetric"
in this fashion, but I cannot prove it.  The recent discussions
by Mike Reid and Mark Longridge about the 24q superflips are
suggestive in this regard.
