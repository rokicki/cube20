Subject: troublemakers and newbies

Folks, please let's not have any more discussion of mailing list
maintenance on Cube-Lovers.  Let me be the only person to break that rule.
I try to do that as rarely as possible.  That's why I usually wait for more
than one person to make the canonical "unsubscribe" mistake before saying
anything in public.  (Unfortunately, the way people always copy the bad
example makes it necessary to offer an occasional public correction.)

You don't see the mail that goes to Cube-Lovers-Request.  If you did, you
would know that public discussions like this always prompt other people to
drop their subscriptions.  Almost every off-topic message is the last straw
for somebody out there.  Please help Cube-Lovers keep it's subscribers --
let me be the only person who sends messages like this.

				- Alan
