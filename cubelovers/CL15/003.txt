Subject: searching for superflip in quarter turn metric
Content-Length: 3083

here's my approach to searching for superflip in the quarter turn metric.
i gave a maneuver of length  24q  for superflip on january 10.  suppose
there is a maneuver of length 22q (or shorter).  consider three cases:

case 1.  there is a minimal maneuver which contains a half-turn.

case 2.  no minimal maneuver contains a half-turn, but there is a
         minimal maneuver which contains consecutive turns of
         opposite faces.

case 3.  neither case 1 nor case 2 hold.


in case 1, we may find a minimal sequence of the form

         sequence_1  sequence_2,

where  sequence_2  is at least  3q  long.  as in the face turn metric,
we may also suppose that  sequence_1  starts with one of

        R1 F1,   R1 F2,   R1 F3,   R1 U1,   R1 U2,   R1 U3,
        R1 L1 U1,   R1 L1 U2,   R1 L1 U3,   R1 L1 F1,   R1 L1 F2,
        R1 L1 F3,   R1 L3 U1,   R1 L3 U2,   R1 L3 F1,   R1 L3 F2.

furthermore, the case starting with  R1 F2  may be included in the
case starting with  R1 F1,  and similarly for other cases.  thus we
may suppose that  sequence_1  starts with one of

        R1 F1,   R1 F3,   R1 U1,   R1 U3,
        R1 L1 U1,   R1 L1 U3,   R1 L1 F1,   R1 L1 F3,
        R1 L3 U1,   R1 L3 F1.


in case 2, we may find a minimal sequence of the form

         sequence_1  sequence_2,

where  sequence_2  is at least  2q  long.  as in case 1, we may suppose
that  sequence_1  starts with one of the ten sequences above.


in case 3, the best we can do is  1q  in stage 2.  however, i claim
that we can find three consecutive turns of mutual adjacent faces.
otherwise, we'd have a maneuver for superflip using only the four faces
F, R, B, L,  (for example)  which is ridiculous, because edges can't
change orientation using only these turns.

therefore, we may suppose that a minimal sequence starts with three
consecutive turns of mutual adjacent faces.  up to symmetry, there
are eight cases for these turns:

      U1 R1 F1,   U1 R1 F3,   U3 R1 F1,   U3 R1 F3,
      D1 R1 F1,   D1 R1 F3,   D3 R1 F1,   D3 R1 F3.

replace   U1 R1 F1  sequence   by   R1 F1  sequence  U1  ,  and
similarly for the other seven cases.  thus we have a minimal
maneuver in the form   sequence_1  sequence_2 ,  where  sequence_2
is  1q  long  and  sequence_1  starts with either  R1 F1  or  R1 F3.


combining all the above cases, a maneuver for superflip in  22q  or less
(assuming one exists) may be found in one of the forms:

        R1 L1 U1  sequence_1  sequence_2,
        R1 L1 U3  sequence_1  sequence_2,
        R1 L1 F1  sequence_1  sequence_2,
        R1 L1 F3  sequence_1  sequence_2,
        R1 L3 U1  sequence_1  sequence_2,
        R1 L3 F1  sequence_1  sequence_2,

where  sequence_1  is at most  17q  long,

        R1 U1  sequence_1  sequence_2,
        R1 U3  sequence_1  sequence_2,

where  sequence_1  is at most  18q  long,

        R1 F1  sequence_1  sequence_2,
        R1 F3  sequence_1  sequence_2,

where  sequence_1  is at most  19q  long.


i don't know how feasible this is (but it sure looks formidable).
to get some idea, first i'll test for  20q  or less.
