The following is a follow up to the discussion on the SKEWB
containing quotes from messages of Martin and myself.

I just noticed that the number of states of the pyraminx (with vertex
rotations included) also equals 75,582,720. (933,120 * 3^4)

I'll amend 'each turn permutes 4' to 'rotates one, 3-cycles the
others', although half the corners do move in some way. Also
the operators are RUF, RUB, RDF and lastly LUF.

The corner LDB remains fixed, so just like the 2x2x2 cube we are
fixing a corner.

My computer Webster says that a tetrad is 'A group of four'. Perhaps
there is another meaning in geometry or group theory? Certainly I
agree with the 2nd statement.

>Snip< I concur with the Martin's next paragraph (excuse the editing)

>So allow me to use the subgroup H generated by RUF, LUB, RDB, and LDF.
>The corresponding four corners do form a tetrad.

Martin, could you clarify the use of tetrad here?  :-)

I'm going to re-read the article and think about this some more.

I shall amend by comment >> above to:

 By moving first one half of the puzzle and then the other we can
easily change the skewb's orientation in space.

 As stated in Douglas Hofstadter's column in the July 1982 issue of
Scientific American, the skewb is a deep-cut puzzle, that is
the part of the puzzle that is being operated on is no
smaller than the stationary portion.
