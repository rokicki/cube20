these subgroups are the 2-sylow subgroups of M.  one of sylow's
theorems states that any two p-sylow subgroups are conjugate.

one of these subgroups is the group of symmetries that preserve
the U-D axis.  call this subgroup  "P".  (this is also the group
of symmetries of the intermediate subgroup of kociemba's algorithm.)

jerry asks about  P-symmetric  positions.  coincidentally, i happened
to investigate these a few weeks back, and here's what i found:
(i calculated by hand, so i'd be grateful for any confirmation.)

there are 128  P-symmetric  positions, 4 of which are  M-symmetric.
they form a subgroup of the cube group (of course) which is
isomorphic to a direct product of 7 copies of  C_2.  in particular,
each such position has order 2 (or 1) as a group element.  thus,
the answer to jerry's question

is "yes".  for what it's worth, this group of 128 positions can be
generated by the seven elements

    superflip
    pons asinorum
    four spots
    slice squared               ( U2 D2 )
    eight flip                  ( FB UD RL FB UD RL )
    four pluses                 ( R2 F2 R2 U'D F2 R2 F2 UD' )
    four swapped corner pairs   ( D' B2 U'D F2 U2 L2 B2 L2 B2 U2 L2 F2 U )

however, these positions are not all locally maximal; for instance
U2 D2  is not.
