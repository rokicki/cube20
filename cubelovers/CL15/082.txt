Sirs ,I am sorry to bother you with junck mail,
but I wish to join Cube-Lovers.
And I have written to you two or three times at the address 
cube-lovers-REQUEST@life.ai.mit.edu and each time after a delay of a No. 
of days I got the response that my mail hadn't been delivered since you 
cuoldn't be found.
Now I know you may not appreciate a new user littering your mail boxes 
with junk mail but I don't know any other way to join in--please excuse me.

Yours sincerely
               Patrick
