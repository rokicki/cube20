Results for the slice group under M-conjugacy:

          Level       Number of        Number of
                      Positions       Local Maxima

           0              1               0
           1              1               0
           2              2               0
           3              6               0
           4             16               0
           5             15               1
           6              9               9

Mike's conjecture that all 24 positions which are a local maxima
at level 5 are equivalent under M-conjugation is correct.

I don't yet understand why Mike's position is a local maximum in the
full cube group.  But assuming it is, it is not only the shortest
local maximum, it is the first local maximum which is not
Q-transitive (i.e, we have |{m'Xm}|=24, hence we have |Symm(X)|=2,
and the size of the symmetry groups for Q-transitive positions
must be divisible by 12.).
