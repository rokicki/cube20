Surprising, but explicable.  Write PA as (RRLL)(UUDD)(FFBB).  Since PA
commutes with everything, [PA](FB') = (FB')[PA].  (I am writing X Y to
mean sequence X followed by sequence Y.)  Note also that [PA](F'B) =
(RRLL)(UUDD)(FB').  But then [PA] = [PA](FB')(F'B) = (FB')[PA](F'B) =
(FB')(RRLL)(UUDD)(FB') gives us a length-12 process for PA whose first
half is what you found.

>       e. (RL')(FB')(RL')     a surprise to me

Me too.  By elimination, its second half must be M-equivalent to the
first half, since we can look at these five half-processes as equally
being M-representatives of the reversals of the PA second halves, and
the other four first halves' second halves account for the other four.
(Got that? :-)  In fact, each first half is M-equivalent to the
reversal of the corresponding second half, which is pleasing.

After juggling letters for a while, I've been unable to "justify" this
process the way I did the one above, which leads me to suspect it may
be a fundamentally new process for PA.  Amazing, the things you can
find when you're not looking for them. :-)

Does this mean you see the fifth process for PA as a trivial
commutation of the known PA process?  How?
