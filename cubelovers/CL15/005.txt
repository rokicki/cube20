Shift Invariance the Final Chapter??
------------------------------------

    2 x Order 2           (the diagonal square element)
    Subgroup <U2, D2, R2, L2>, order = 2
    D2 F2 T2 F2 B2 T2 F2 T2

    2 Swap                (the single square element)
    Subgroup <U2, D, R2, L>, order = 2
    D2 R2 D2 R2 D2 R2

    2 H                   (the edge square element)
    Subgroup <U, D, R2, L2>, order = 2
    L2 R2 B2 L2 R2 F2

    12 flip               (the central element)
    Subgroup <U, D, F, B, L, R>, order = 2
    R1 L1 D2 B3 L2 F2 R2 U3 D1 R3 D2 F3 B3 D3 F2 D3 R2 U3 F2 D3
    Special Property: Effects all edges the same

    6 Counterclockwise twist   (the odd element)
    Subgroup <U, R>, order = 3
    U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3 U2 R1 U1 R1 U1 R3 U1 R3 U1 R3
    Special Property: Effects all corners the same


Martin's message about the SuperSkewb having a non-trivial centre
reminded me that the SuperCube should have 3 more positions which
are also shift invariant:

3x3x3 cube with 6 centre pieces rotated 90, 180 and 270 degrees,
 with orders 4, 2 and 4 respectively. This time all the centres
 are effected the same!

Naturally there are 3 more positions in SG's <U, R> as well.

A pity there is no "Centre All-Twist" process in any of the cube
 literature.

-> Mark <-

I'll leave a superflip process for the Magic Dodecahedron as a
'exercise for the reader'     ;-)
