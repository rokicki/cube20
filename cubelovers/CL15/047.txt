we've had this discussion before.  pons asinorum does not "commute with
everything".  however, it does commute with "slices" and with cube
symmetries.  (which is all you're really using here.)

the only reason i'm not surprised here is that i've read the archives.
dan hoey gave this maneuver on jan 7 1981.  also, it was recently
mentioned by chris worrell (on dec 16 1994).

er, i think he means that "many" (i.e. 4) of the 5 maneuvers are closely
related.

however, i disagree with jerry's conjecture that the maneuvers for pons
asinorum composed with superflip will be closely related.

i guess we'll know for sure fairly soon.
