For well over 99% of the positions we have |{m'Xm}|=48, so it will
be a long time before a random walk finds anything.  If my quick
and dirty calculations are correct, |{m'Xm}|=48 for in excess
of 99.9999986% of the M-conjugate classes.  For positions themselves,
the percentage would be higher still.
