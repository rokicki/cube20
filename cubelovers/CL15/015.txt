Subject: Symmetry reductions of the superflip (oops)

I forgot to say: You should cyclically permute the sequence of face turns in
the superflip to begin with to ensure that the sequence does not begin and end
with turns on the same axis.  Only then can you be sure that you have one of 
the forms (1)...(4).
