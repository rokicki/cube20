For crying out loud, do -not- send administrative requests to the -entire-
mailing list.  You're the third idiot to make this mistake recently, so I
guess I really do have to bother everybody myself with a reminder.

THINK! THINK! THINK!  If you wanted to stop your subscription to a
magazine, would you send postal mail to -all- of the other subscribers?

Send all administrative requests to:

  Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU

Everybody got that?
