This chart includes a column for local maxima, which my charts
usually do not.  With all the data kept in files instead of memory,
it is not a very natural calculation to determine which positions
are local maxima.  With the data in memory, for any position X
you would calculate the 12 neighbors Xq, and immediately determine
which of the 12 neighbors were one move closer to Start.  It is
easy to identify local maxima in this situation.  With the data
written to files, the neighbors Xq are sorted before determining
which are closer to Start, and there is no (easy) way to relate
a given Xq back to its original X.

However, let me describe the sorting/merging process in a little
more detail.  There is a file containing all cubes X such that
|X|=n.  The neighbors Xq are written to a file.  The file
is sorted, with duplicates deleted.  (Actually, the problem is so
large that there are *many* files containing the neighbors Xq.
Each file is sorted, and then the results are merged).  Finally, the
resulting file is matched against another file containing all
cubes Y such that |Y|=(n-1).  Any matches are deleted, and whatever
is left over becomes the file containing all cubes Z such that
|Z|=(n+1).  The difference between the number of matches deleted
and the number of cubes in the n-1 file is the number of local
maxima of length n-1.  (Remember that all the X's and Y's and Z's
and Xq's are representative elements of M-conjugacy classes.)

The last time through this process, I generated neighbors of level
10 to create level 11, sorted and deleted duplicates, and matched
against level 9 deleting matches.  Hence, the last level for which
I have local maxima information is level 9.

There are not any local maxima through level 9.  I am not really
expecting any until Pons Asinorum at level 12.  However, it would
be nice to verify that Pons Asinorum is the shortest local maximum.
