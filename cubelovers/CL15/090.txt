Dear puzzle lovers,

     Presenting MIT Club of Southern California's...


                             PUZZLE PARTY 2!

At our first puzzle party in February, Parker's place was packed with
puzzlers of all sorts!  Puzzling continued for hours, with the last
hard-core, half-crazed puzzlers quitting at 5AM.  The party featured the
the puzzles and participation of the Master Puzzler himself, Mr. Jerry
Slocum, a UCLA alumnus who has authored three puzzle books and owns an
unmatched 20,000-piece private collection of puzzles.  [Incidentally, on
May 9th and June 22nd, Jerry and his Puzzle Museum will be featured in
Start to Finish on the Discovery Channel.]

If you didn't have a chance to participate, you'll have another
opportunity at PUZZLE PARTY TWO.  So, dig out your favorite brain teasers,
mental games, IQ tests, and mechanical puzzles.  If you have a
puzzle-freak friend, bring him/her!  Like the first party, this will be a
leisurely puzzling event with amusing problems as well as food, drink, and
conversation by the fireside.  So grab your brain and some puzzles...
and see you there!
