Subject: Rubik's cube
X-Mailer: <Windows Eudora Version 1.4.2b16>

I am a cube lover.  I can solve both the rubik's cube and the rubik's
revenge.  My personal best at the regular cube is 45 seconds, but it usually
takes me about 1min20sec.  

The few cubes I have are getting really beat up, and I would really like to
know if there is still some way to get some new ones.

I would appreciate any help.
