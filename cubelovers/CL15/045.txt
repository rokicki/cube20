Subject:   Qturn Lengths of M-Symmetric Positions

1. The length of Start is of course 0 qturns.

2. The length of Pons Asinorum is of course 12 qturns.  This result
   has been known since 1980.  However, in the process of testing
   out half-depth searches, I tested Pons Asinorum and encountered
   a minor surprise.  There are five "halfway" positions which
   are unique up to M-conjugacy.  I only expected three.  They
   are:

      a. (RRLL)(FF)          expected -- continue BB etc.
      b. (RRLL)(FB)          expected -- continue FB etc.
      c. (RRLL)(FB')         expected -- continue FB' etc.
      d. (FB')(RRLL)         a surprise to me
      e. (RL')(FB')(RL')     a surprise to me

3. The length of Pons Asinorum composed with Superflip is
   20 qturns.  Half-depth searches through level 9 found nothing.
   A half-depth search at level 10 found ten "halfway" positions which
   are unique up to M-conjugacy.  I have my usual trouble of spinning
   tapes containing representative elements in order to find the
   processes, but I should have them in a couple of days or so.
   I expect we will find that many (or all) of them are really
   closely related, differing only by commuting in fairly trivial
   ways, just as do the five half-way positions for Pons Asinorum.

4. The length of Superflip is 24 qturns.  Half-depth searches
   through level 11 found nothing, so the length is greater than
   22.  Mike Reid has found a Superflip process of length 24.
   Hence, the length is 24.  It would be more satisfying if I
   could perform a half-depth search to level 12, but the
   problem is just too big.  Hence, I have no idea how
   many "halfway" positions there are which are unique up to
   M-conjugacy.
