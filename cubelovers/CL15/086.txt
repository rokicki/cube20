i don't think you need to regenerate; you just need to put your
old list through your new representative choosing function and
sort the output.  of course, regenerating would give a reasonable
consistency check.

remember that the diameter of the group is small.  (my guess is
21 face turns, 24 quarter turns.)  so this isn't possible without
resorting to a liberal definition of "very close".
