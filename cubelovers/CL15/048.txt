This presentation of the data is a little dissatisfying.  These ten
processes yield representative element *positions*.  With a certain
amount of analysis, you could take M-conjugates of the *processes*,
plus maybe a little astute rearranging of commuting moves, and
make the processes look a little more similar, I think.  I actually
did so for the five Pons Asinorum halfway positions, but those
were easy to futz around with compared to the ones above.

Notice, for example, that the first three moves of each of the
first nine processes are M-conjugates.  That is about as far
as I can go in my head.
