Quite a while ago I asked Dan the question above, and I've thought
a lot about the answer.

So I decided to look at certain cube positions and I wrote a module
to perform
                        C and C + Sm

where
C  = 24 rotations of the cube
Sm = Central Reflection

on any pattern I had in my database, and count how many different
patterns resulted from the 48 operations.

The following are some patterns which I found:

Number of
different       Pattern
patterns        -------
---------

48              R1 U1
24              L2 U2
16              Mark's Pattern 1 (18 q+h, 22 q)
                R2 U3 R1 D1 F1 B1 R3 L3 U1 D1 F3 U1 F3 U2 D3 B2 R2 U1
                (Also 7 clockwise + 1 anticlockwise corner twist)
12              2 dot, 2 T, 2 ARM (sq group antipode, see p108)
 8              6 Dot (a slice pattern)
 6              2 DOT, 4 ARM (sq group antipode, see p99)
 4              ????
 3              4 Dot pattern (slice pattern)
 2              6 H pattern type 2, T2 B2 L2 T2 D2 L2 F2 T2
 1              Pons Asinorum (6 X order 2) or all edges flipped

 It took a while to find a pattern which could be transformed 16
different ways. Still trying to find a pattern which will
result in 4 distinct ways, but I am not optimistic. A random walk
through the cube resulted in a pattern which would transform
48 ways in every case I tried.

Here's a small followup to the pancentre question. The reason
why the 7 clockwise + 1 anticlockwise corner twist is the next
most commutative element after the 12-flip & start is because
it has the most number of cube elements (in this case corners)
the same as possible without all the elements being the same,
as with the 12-flip. It must be 7 clockwise + 1 anticlockwise
corner twist because the next most commutative element effecting
edges only would be the 10-flip and that would have 2 elements
not the same as the rest instead of just 1.
