This is what I was trying to say in the message that started this: that
one is building a tree of all move sequences no longer than N, which is
to say a certain subset of permutations of the cube.  But these
permutations can be applied to arbitrary positions just as well as as
they can be to Start.  Any Cubist knows this; it's the basis for many
of the common solving macros: that a process that (say) swaps RF and
RB, and TF and TB, can be used to swap whatever cubies happen to be in
those cubicles, even if they aren't the RF/RB/TF/TB cubies.
