Argh!  After Dan and Mike pointed this out,  I did remember having seen
it in the archives.  Worse still, Dan pointed it out again on
3 August 1992.  But since it has come up, let's take a brief look
at the 22 March 1981 note.

Call the 4-spot s.  Then, the twelve neighbors form two M-conjugacy
classes:  N1={sL,sL',sF,sF',sR,sR',sB,sB'} and N2={sU,sU',sD,sD'}.
Also, we have s'=s.  Dan and Jim's solution starts in N1 and ends with
a quarter-turn from N2, and since s'=s, we can say "or vice versa".
Hence, we can start a solution with any of the twelve quarter turns,
and therefore s is a local maximum.

There are other positions with the same symmetry characteristics as
the 4-spot.  That is, there are other positions for which the
symmetry group contains sixteen elements.  There are only three subgroups
of M containing sixteen elements, and the three subgroups are M conjugate.
The three M-conjugates of the 4-spot position correspond to the three
conjugate subgroups of M containing sixteen elements.  But what of
other positions with the same symmetry group?  For example, if the
edges of the 4-spot are all flipped, is the position a local maximum?
I don't know, but it is interesting to see how far we can get without
knowing a process.

Call the 4-spot with all edges flipped t.  Then, we certainly have
t'=t.  Is this true of all positions whose symmetry group contains
sixteen elements?  Also, we certainly have the twelve neighbors
forming M-conjugacy classes similar to those for s, N1 with eight
elements and N2 with four.  Is this true of all positions whose symmetry
group contains sixteen elements?  Finally, a solution either starts in
N1 or starts in N2.  If starting in N1 implies ending with a
quarter-turn from N2 or vice versa, then t is a local maximum.
Can we prove such a thing without actually finding a solution?
