If we mark the squares as

        0 1 2
        3 4 5
        6 7 8 9

then I gave a solution which makes the blank space follow the path 8 7
6 3 4 5 8 7 4 1 2 5 8 7 6 3 4 1 0 3 4 7 6 3 0 1 4 7 8 9.  I remarked:

I finally got around to generating all minimal-length solutions.  It
turns out, curiously enough, that each solution is uniquely determined
by the pattern of its middle position.  There are ten solutions, listed
here in terms of the path taken by the blank space, with the middle
position written out:

Of course, whether this actually matters to anyone is another story :-)
