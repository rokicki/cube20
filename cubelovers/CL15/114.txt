We now have the following M-conjugacy results (2q moves only,
still working on 4q moves).

The level 5 local maximum is (U'D')(FB)(FB)(UD)(L'R').  The position is
not its own inverse, but we can use as an inverse (U'D')(FB)(FB)(UD)(LR).
Hence, (U'D')(FB)(FB)(UD) forms a nice "middle" of the sequence.  In
fact, the (U'D')(FB)(FB)(UD) position in some ways seems more
interesting than the local maximum itself.  Does it already have
a name?

I have not verified if the length of the local maximum is 10q in G,
nor if it is a local maximum in G.
