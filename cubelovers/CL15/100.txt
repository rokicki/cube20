I might prefer an alternative set of definitions:  1) a local
maximum is a position none of whose neighbors are further from
Start, 2) a strong local maximum is a position all of whose
neighbors are strictly closer to Start, and 3) a weak local
maximum is a local maximum which is not a strong local maximum.
But in the table which follows, I adopt Mike's definition.
