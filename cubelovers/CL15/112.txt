I can confirm your count.  These positions are called X class positions
in Dan's taxonomy.  That is, there are 124 positions Y unique up to
M-conjugancy for which Symm(Y)=X1 or Symm(Y)=X2 or Symm(Y)=X3, where
X1, X2, and X3 are the three conjugate subgroups of M in Dan's
taxonomy of subgroups which contain sixteen elements. Hence, we
describe the 124 positions as being class X positions.  The 4
M-symmetric positions are also X-symmetric, but we don't count them
as class X.
