Since Patrick <patrick@athos.med.auth.gr> went public with his[%]
complaint, I'll defend publicly, even though neither one is really
on-topic for cube-lovers.  I hope Alan won't get too upset, and I
really hope this doesn't turn into a flamewar; cube-lovers has been
notably free of them in the time I've been on it.

You seem to be under the impression that cube-lovers is a "news group".
It's not; it's a mailing list.  If you don't know the difference and
can't find anything local to explain it, send me mail privately and
I'll try to explain it.

Yes, it's true, that's one of the things newbies can do.  But that does
not mean that it's a good thing to do, nor that it's reasonable to try
to do it without first learning the correct way to do it.

And when someone stumbles into a milieu without having first bothered
to learn the rudiments of etiquiette as practiced therein, I don't feel
it's unreasonable to meet that someone with a certain degree of
rejection.

> 2)Now if Mr Allan responds to their mistakes very rudly ,e.g

I notice your address is in Greece, so I'll excuse this on grounds of
ignorance.  In English, one does not use titles (such as Mr.) with
given names.  It would be just "Alan" (not "Allan", since he's Alan
Bawden, not Allan Bawden), or "Mr. Bawden".

I don't consider it excessive to be a little harsh to people who are
being that rude.  When Frank=Lindgreen%DATLING%HHASPR@lng.hha.dk was
subscribed to the list to begin with, he[%] was sent a document
explicitly describing how to unsubscribe.

[%] Gender assumed from what looks like a given name in the address.

If a _subscribe_ request goes to the whole list, it's still someone
stumbling in in ignorance.  But at least it can mostly be excused as
ignorance.  An _unsubscribe_ request can't; anyone with cause to send
an unsubscribe request must already have subscribed, and thus been told
the correct way to unsubscribe.

I suggest you cut "Mr. Allan" some slack.  I have participated in and
mailing lists for many years now, and overall, Alan Bawden is one of
the best list admins I've ever seen.  Yes, it would be better if he[%]
could remain firm and polite in the face of such provocation.  But
(apparently unlike you) I don't expect perfection from him.

[%] Again, gender assumed from the given name.  (English needs a good
    gender-neutral animate set of pronouns.)

Perhaps that merely reflects on the poor crop of list admins available.
I don't think so; I certainly doubt I would do much better.  Perhaps
you feel you could do better; I invite you to try.  Start up a list of
your own and see how it goes.

I'm inclined to agree.  If Frank=Lindgreen%DATLING%HHASPR@lng.hha.dk
had thought enough to bother rereading the instructions sent when he
subscribed to the list, or even had bothered to learn basic netiquette
for Internet mailing lists in general, he would have known better than
to send the unsubscribe request to the whole list.

"can think" != "do think".  As is often amply demonstrated on the net.

This is important enough to bear re-quoting, I feel.
