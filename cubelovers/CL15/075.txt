Hello,

Can anybody suggest how I might be able to get copies of David Singmaster's
"Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube" and A. H. Frey and Singmaster's "Handbook of
Cubik Math" ?

How about Christoph Bandelow's "Inside Rubik's Cube and Beyond" ?

I'm also looking for Chris Rowley's "The group of the Hungarian Magic Cube"
(in Algebraic Structures and Applications, Proceedings of the First Western
Australian Conference on Algebra, 1982).


Many thanks,

  -- Ivan
