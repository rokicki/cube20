Yes. We have a robot that knows how to do it!

The World Wide Web page with images of the 2 robots of DAIA
(Departament of Artificial Intelligence and Automation) of
LSI (Laboratory of Integrated Systems) at USP (University of
Sao Paulo, Brazil) is here:

http://www.lsi.usp.br/usp/rod/images/cube/rubik_cube.html

Of course, it's Netscape enhanced.
This page has also a link to a page I made with the X-Rubik's Cube
software (xrubik.html in the same address), with inlined images
of the software.

Have fun.
