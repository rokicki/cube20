Joe,

The guy to talk to is Christoph Bandelow.  His email address is

   mailto:Christoph.Bandelow@ruhr-uni-bochum.de

(I'm pretty sure he monitors the list.)  He is located in Germany and
has a bunch of other puzzles that I'm sure you will be interested in.
He is very prompt with delivering orders, and is very easy to work
with.

My Rubik's Revenge sat broken on the shelf for about 15 years.  After
contacting Christoph, my Rubik's Revenge is as good as new!  Not to
mention that I now have a few more puzzles that I didn't have before. 
Buy a few of his puzzles (5^3's etc.), and he might give you a good
deal on the 4^3 replacement parts.

Hope this helps.

-Darin

P.S.  Let us know how everything turns out.  I'm sure there are other
people in the same boat.

Uwe Meffert was too humble to post the following facts to the list.  However,
true cube lovers know that facts are too important.  Just as we needed to be
informed that recent remakes of old standards by Odds-On don't survive very
long in actual use, we need to know of superb manufactures such as the ones
in this thread.  Therefore I post them.

Recently my wife and I visited Mr. Meffert in Hong Kong and played with some
of his products and prototypes.  Prototypes of the assembly cubes were the
smoothest turning cubes that we have ever got our hands on.  In addition the
assembly cubes had colored tiles which look like they will not wear out during
an owner's lifetime.

Mr. Meffert added in private e-mail, with permission to repost:  the cube has a
unique patented mechanism which allows assembly disassembly of the cube
without screws or tools, which in itself is quite a challenge.

I have just finished modelling the Square One puzzle in Puzzler and in
testing found a flaw in my solution.  In order to correct a parity problem
(where you have to swap only 2 pieces rather than 4) I do the following
move:

(in Arensburger notation:)

R,t3,b3,R,t1,b2,R,t2,b2,R,t6,R,b-2,t-2,R,b-2,t-1,R,b-3,t-3,R

This scrambles the cube up a bit but makes it solvable using standard moves.

There must be a better move than this!  If anyone knows a better way to swap
two pieces, let me know.

I agree with Norman's comments.  I recently received two of the new ASSEMBLY
CUBES and they turn very smoothly immediately after assembly.  No
lubricating is required.  The cube is neither too loose nor too tight.  The
use of the metal key to pop a center piece off is quite ingenious.  I'd say
the only cubes that rival the ASSEMBLY CUBE's quality are the 1982-vintage
Deluxe Cubes by Ideal.  They had that springy, elastic feel that was
critical for speed cubing.  Meffert's are definitely the very best
contemporary deluxe cubes around, though.

I can't wait for the transparent version to be available!

Dear Cube Lovers,

I just joined the cube lovers' society. So, here's a bit of a cv: I
started Cubology after the first cubes were marketed in Germany. I'm a
member of the NKC, the dutch cube club. Cube Lovers who are members
too and read CFF, (standing for Cubism For Fun - the NKC's
publication) know me either from meetings at the annual Cube Days or
from the articles, I published in CFF.  Since I have a PC with an AMD
K6-III/450MHz and 128 RAM, I can run Herbert Kociemba's "Cube Explorer
and the add-on programme "Cube Optimizer", which re-activated my
interest in Pretty Patterns by looking for new species and finding
shorter manoeuvers of those that are in my almost 20 years old
collection. The results are amazing: I discover entirely new Pretties
and shorten lots of existing algorithms.
Here are a few of my recent discoveries:
R2 B2 U' L' B D' B R2 D2 L' F' D R2 U2  (14f*)
D2 U L' B L2 B' L U' B D2 B2 U2 B' F' U2  (15f*)

U' F U2 F2 L' D2 B L2 D R F2 L' U' R2 B' F2 D' (17)
If you are a hunter of Pretties, please let me know and my recent
findings are yours! Obviously, I'd appreciate to be informed about
cubological developments from other fellow Cube Lovers. 3x3x3, 4x4x4
and 5x5x5 cube info's are welcome indeed.

Cubology to you!

Thanks to all who sent suggestions.  I achieved a successful repair
using a product called 'J-B Weld' and a pin (actually a cut off box
nail.)  The 'J-B Weld' is very strong and hardens almost to the same
hardness as the

original material.  I've been using the cube now for over a week and
it is holding up very well, although it probably is going to wear out
faster now since I take it apart quite often to inspect the repair.

Subject: Re: Rubik's Cube Perpetual Calendar
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 1999 23:05:08 +0100

A calendar cube has just sold on eBay.  Quite possibly it comes from
the same source as the cube Chris Pelley mentioned.  The description
includes a picture, from which I see that it is not the same cube as
the one I described on 30 July, which was bought in the UK.  The eBay
version uses a different type-face and uses upper and lower case for
the week-day names, unlike the British version, which uses all
capitals.   It also has logos, whereas the British version has blanks
on all faces that are not used for date markings. The British version
was nonetheless a genuine Ideal cube and came in a cardboard drum
bearing the title Rubik's Calendar and the copyright notice
"[c-in-a-circle] MMLXXXI Ideal Toy Co Ltd, Wokingham, Berks".  There
are other European calendar cubes pictured on eBay which are like the
British one

There is something very strange about the cube in the eBay photo.  In
fact, I am convinced that is does not work for all dates, which drives
me to the conclusion that the stickers have been rearranged.  I'll
explain my reasons and see if others disagree.

The photo shows only one view, so we have only three faces to work on.
They look like this:

-------------------   -------------------
The orientation is shown by the Vs, which point to the local upright
for those markings that are not upright as shown - I've followed Dan
in this.

Once the markings on the various pieces of a calendar cube have been
fixed, the way the cube is assembled does not matter, since to show
the date we need solve only one face, and that can be done from any
starting position, any necessary counterbalancing twists or
permutations taking place in the other layers.  Let's assume the face
used to show the date is the front face.

Therefore we only need to worry about what markings each piece will
bear.  The straightforward approach in designing a cube of this sort,
it seems to me, is as far as possible to keep all the markings of the
same type - that is, destined for the same position on the front
face - together on the pieces carrying them.  So the week-day names
would be on one set of corner pieces, destined for the top left of the
front face, and the numbers forming the units digit of the day of the
month would be on another set, destined for the bottom right of the
front face.  In that way, clashes in which the piece would be needed
in two places at once are avoided.  If this approach is not followed,
then either there must be no clash, or markings must be duplicated.
An example of the first would be an edge piece that combined the F or
B of FEB with the 3 of the tens digit of the day of the month, a
combination that is possible because there is no FEB 30.  The picture
on the container of the British calendar cube, though not the cube
itself, illustrates the other possibility, since one edge-piece
combines J and 2.  That means that JAN 20 and similar dates cannot be
shown unless either the J or the 2 is duplicated.  As it happens,
there is one spare edge-piece face on that cube, so one duplication
could be managed, but no more, but it is impossible to see from the
picture if there is any duplication.  Probably not, because there are
some other impossibilities and inconsistencies in the pictures which
suggest they show non-functioning mock-ups.

The different markings that need to be accommodated on the edge
pieces, defined by their position on the front face, are:

Top:  DAY

Left: the eight initial letters of the month, J F M A S O N D

Right: the ten letters completing the abbreviation for the month, N B
R Y L G P T V C

Bottom: the four numbers for the tens digit of the day of the month, 0
(or blank) 1 2 3.

The edge-piece at the top will always stay there, since it is needed
to show DAY (assuming no duplicates).  So the other face of this piece
will never show on the front face and cannot carry a useful marking.
It can be blank, or carry a logo.

In total, including the face backing DAY, we now have 24 faces, and
that is exactly the number we have available if we have one face for
each of the markings above.  As it happens, the one letter that occurs
at both the start and the end of a month, N, is symmetrical in the
sans-serif typeface used, and in the British cube is made to double as
a starting and an ending letter, since it can be either way up. That
frees up one face to permit one duplication.  It is impossible to see
if the same approach is followed in the eBay cube.

As a matter of interest, the British cube mostly (but not in all
cases) puts an initial and a final letter together on the same
edge-piece.  That is possible without too much juggling to avoid the
clash of having the start and end of a month on the same edge piece,
but is not necessary - the principle of segregating the different
types of marking would lead to four edge-pieces with the initial
letters and five with final letters.

If we turn back to the eBay cube, we find that the visible edge-pieces
are as follows.

Day/P, J?, M?, 1A, F?, 3?, B/blank, blank/? logo/?, 3x??

Since Day is combined with P, we need a duplicate of one or other if
dates in SEP or APR are to be showable.  But even then we would not be
able to show APR 10 unless a duplicate of 1 or A was included.  Thus
even if one N is used for both the start of NOV and the end of JAN or
JUN, we would already have one face too many.  Yet on top of that
there are two blanks and a logo.  One blank is usable as the blank for
the tens digit in dates like JAN 1, and one among the month letters is
there is only one N.  But that still means that there is an extra
blank even if there are no duplicates.

If extra blank faces are included, then other needed markings must be
omitted and dates involving those markings could not be shown.  In
fact the only reasonable explanation I can see is that some stickers
have been removed and put back wrongly.

For starters, you'd be amazed what a B6 added to the beginning or end of
this pattern will do. :-) Alternatively, you could skip over that and
simply add two dual edge swaps by appending something like
t1,R,t-1,b-1,R,t6,R,t1,b1,R,t3,b3,R,t-1,b-1,R,t6,R,t1,b1,R,t-4,b-3
to the beginning or end of your pattern. L8r.

little grooves in them and all of them on each face were lined up in the
same direction.  After I learned how to solve the cube for color I
decided to try to solve it so that all of the little grooves lined up.
After much hard work I finally got it and can repeat the solution.  It
is a wonderful challenge after you've grown tired of solving it the
'normal' way!  I won't give the solution unless I see that there is
interest in it here in this list

To all CubeLovers.

I am conducting a color survey for a revised color scheme for the new molded
tiles that I am preparing for some of our Puzzles for Xmas.

The final choice will be based on the majority of the suggestions received
from CubeLovers like you.

Megaminx: do you prefer 6 colors or 12 colors;  If 12, which colors?

Prof. cube & new improved 4x4x4 cube: any color preferences?

Looking forward to hearing from you all, your input is important as this is
most likely the last time that I will run some of these Items.

The other good news is that I have finally been persuaded to release several
new puzzles for Xmas.  More later

With warm regards to all
Uwe

I'd like to try taking my Pyramorphix puzzle apart to see what makes it
tick. I took a brief look at it today, but the internal mechanism appears
to be somewhat delicate. of course, it could just be paranoia on my part.
How does one go about taking a Pyramorphix apart safely? L8r.

Hello,

	In case anyone is interested, Uwe Meffert is now selling the
Square 1.  I've been looking to buy one for a while, and this is the
perfect opportunity (www.mefferts-puzzles.com/mefferts-puzzles/index.html).  
In relation to the Square 1, I once came across a program that claimed to
help one solve the puzzle.  I could have sworn I saved it to my hard
drive, but now, when I look for it, I can't find it.  I thought it was
called Square1.Exe or Square1.Bas Does anybody know anything about this
program or have a copy lying around?

		Thanks,
		 Matt

Yes, the grooving effect shows up quite strikingly against the light
as two distinct shades and allows some nice pretty patterns.  Since
there are only two apparent alternatives, whereas there are four
possible orientations, some possibilities look a little surprising, to
my eyes at least.  Thus a three-cycle of centre pieces shows up as a
change to just two pieces.

The Pyramorphix mechanism is indeed delicate and can not be taken apart
without the risk of destroying it, after assembly the last piece is glued

I snipped off the same corner of every sticker on each face so that all of the face
cubies have to be positioned correctly for a 'complete' solution.  If you have good
eyes (I recently had cataract surgery) you will not need to snip off enough to make
it obtrusive.  My second 5x5x5 just arrived in today's mail and it almost seems like
cheating to solve it in the 'normal' manner after solving for 'completeness.'

Hi all,
This is my first post to Cube-Lovers, though I have been reading the archives
for a long time now. I'm a 27 year-old mathematician.

Re: Square-1
A few years ago I figured out a solution to the Square-1. It was one of the
hardest puzzles to solve. Though I did theoretically solved it, the solution
was so long and tedious I never actually performed it. In the end I wrote a
program that searched for short sequences that go from cube shape to cube shape
that do not move the corners. In the list it produced were a few useful
sequences moving only a few edges, but all the odd permutations moved a lot of
edges. By combining one of them with some other sequences I finally got my own
parity fixing sequence that is a nice triple edge swap:

Swap FU-BU, LU-RU, FD-BD:
      /(3,3)/(1,2)/(2,-4)/(-2,4)/(-1,1)/(3,3)/(0,3)/(3,3)/(0,3)/(6,0)/(6,0)/

The notation is fairly obvious: /=half turn of right hand side, (t,b)=move
top/bottom the given number of twelfths clockwise, negative for anti-clockwise.
I find this much easier to read than any others I've seen, though it is
sometimes easy to forget the leading / if there is one.

Unfortunately I have since lost any other results I got then except for those I
have incorporated into my solution.

The square-1 solving program Matt mentioned can be found in the cube-lovers
archive in the contrib directory.


Re: my webpages
I have recently typed up a lot of my notes and put them on the web in a
text-only preliminary form. Eventually I hope to make them into proper
web-pages with pictures etc.
There are solutions there for:
Alexander's Star, Pocket Cube (2x2x2), Rubik's Cube (3x3x3), Rubik's Revenge
(4x4x4), Profesor's Cube (5x5x5), Dogic, Domino, Impossiball, Megaminx,
Octahedron, Pyraminx, Pyramorphix, Skewb, Brain ball, Rubik's Fifteen, Equator,
It, Ivory Tower (Babylon Tower), Masterball, Orb, Puck, Roundy, Square One,
Topspin, Tower (Whip-It), Rubik's Triamid, Tricky Disky, Rubik's Clock, Lights
Out, Rubik's Magic, Spinout, Crazy Tantrix.
At the moment there is not yet a links page.

You can find it here: http://www.org2.com/jaap/puzzles
I'd appreciate any feedback.


Re: Pyramorphix.
I only have the pocket Pyramorphix, and these are delicate (my first one broke
within 5 minutes). The pieces have small feet which slide through grooves in a
ball. The grooves are formed between 8 triangular pieces which are screwed onto
the ball. By pushing a small screwdriver through at a point where 4 pieces come
together you can unscrew it. It may work best if you bring the 4 flat pieces
together and use the spot between them to unscrew it.


Re: Cheap Skewballs.
This week I bought several cheap puzzleballs at the Oxford Toys'r'Us, all of
the France '98 type.  I bought the last two keychain ones (1 uk pound each),
and a couple of normal sized ones (2 uk pounds each). They still have many of
those.
I plan to paint them with diffent designs, e.g.
dodecahedron/icosahedron/octahedron, or rather the spherical projections of
these shapes.

That's all for now.
Bye,
Jaap.

To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

    After a hard day of solving the skewb for the first time it started to
become loose in my hands and eventually fall apart. As I put it back together
I noticed that the problem was that one of the four corners which are
connected to the internal mechanism would unscrew whenever it was rotated
counter clockwise, eventually causing it to move far enough away from the
mechanism as to cause the pieces to fall away. Is this a problem which has
been encountered by other regular Skewbers? If anyone knows what sort of
mechanism usually keeps the corner attached properly and/or how to fix such
an error I would be grateful.

Dear Terrence

I am sorry to hear that you are one of the very few persons experiencing
problem with the Skewb. I believe that you are actually the first. Even so
there have a few identical problems with the Prof.cube.

What unfortunately happened is that when gluing the corner cap excess
glue fixed the screw to the plastic corner piece that it should turn
in.  So when you turn this section it will tighten / loosen that one
screw.

If you are skilful enough you can try and carefully remove the corner
cap to expose the screw that has become loose.  Then try to remove the
excess glue from around the screw with a sharp object and try turning
the screw with a screwdriver firmly holding the plastic piece so you
can break the glue bond.  Once the screw can freely turn inside the
plastic part, re-tighten it to the same tension as it was originally,
so as to allow smooth turning without any pieces falling out during
play.  Then carefully using only very little glue fix the corner cap
back into place.

Please let me know the outcome of this recommended procedure. If you can't
fix it please let me know and I will send you a free replacement.

Sorry for any frustration and inconvenience caused.

Good Luck and Happy Puzzling.

Hi all, I'm new to this list, and new to the cube as well - only got my
first one in March.
Of course, now it doesn't leave my side.

I have seen a few Cube-Lovers emails about solving the cube in a minimum
number of looks. Here is a system that I use to solve the cube in 1 look,
with 10-25 minutes of studying time. (Please excuse my lack of knowledge
of terminology/group theory.)
_________________________________________________

When most people solve the cube they do it by decomposing the whole
problem into successively more specific subgroups. (e.g. first layer
edges, first layer corners, second layer edges, etc.) I say "successively
more specific" because the moves someone would use to position the first
few pieces are very simple and intuitive, usually changing (but not
solving) the unsolved pieces in the cube. As one approaches the solved
state, one uses much more specialized algorithms that affect only the
remaining unsolved pieces.

For "multiple-look" purposes, this is a great approach. Often the smaller
the subgroup of pieces affected by an algorithm, the larger the number of
moves in that algorithm, and since there is usually no perceived order to
the unsolved pieces, there is no benefit to preserving them with lengthy
specialized moves.

To a person visualizing an entire solution in his or her head, however,
these types of moves are very expensive in terms of memory. Instead I
begin from the start using specialized moves that affect as little of the
cube as possible. I might start off with an algorithm to permute 3 corners
(hopefully putting at least two of them in the correct place/orientation)
while leaving the other 5 corners and all 12 edges untouched.

In fact, by the time I have all of the corners solved, the edge pieces are
in exactly the same random configuration as when I started! (with the
possible exception of having interchanged exactly 2 of them.) The solution
has then been decomposed into 2 nearly independent problems.  The moves I
use are mostly single-layer permutations with
some commutators mixed in when necessary.

One can get the corners solved after applying 5 or 6 move sequences, and
then solve the edges with an additional 7 or 8 sequences. (This has
nothing to do with the number of moves used to solve the cube. In fact,
when I solve it with my eyes closed, I average 150-200 moves!)
_____________________________________________________

The Rules:
I would consider it cheating to use a pen and paper. Basically, you have
to sit down with a random cube and look at it for a while without
manipulating it. Then close your eyes and start solving. When you next
open them, it should be solved. (You don't get to "practice" the moves
before you go.)
_____________________________________________________

So, has anyone else tried this?  I'm curious to know what method someone
else uses.  I use my 15 minutes of studying time to plan out where I'm
going to need to move the pieces.  I wonder if anyone with better memory
skills can just memorize the locations of all the pieces and then work out
the entire solution with their eyes closed.

There was discussion of blindfolded solving during March 98 on this
list.  At that time no one was able to do it.  You may be the first.

Subject: Rubik-like puzzles I've never seen before...

[I was referred to this list by someone who read a post I made in the
rec.puzzles newsgroup; I'm not a member of the list, but have some
questions about puzzles I've run across on eBay recently that I'm
curious of their origin.  I thought maybe you'd post my questions
on the list.  Please direct followups to my email address.]

I check out eBay regularly for Rubik's Cube type puzzles I don't have...
Recently I've come across a few I've never seen before -- does anybody
know where they came from?  Or better yet, where I might find them
cheaply, as the prices on eBay seem to be way up there...

1) The Gem/Diamond.  This is an octahedron, but each face is one solid
piece, and it appears to turn in half, turning four triangulars on the
square plan between halves.

2) ??.  This is a 14-sided puzzle, with 8 triangles and 6 squares.  Two
opposite triangles make the "centers" (in 3x3x3 terms), around which
three squares and three triangles turn.  I don't know if ALL triangles
act as centers...  It can be left "unshaped" similar to Square-1, only
not so jarringly.

3) Siamese Cube.  This was an old hack in the 80s, with two normal cubes
sharing a row of two corners and an edge, but these look professionally
made, and are made out of the new OddzOn cubes apparently.  They come
with a display case.

4) "Triple" Cube.  This is similar to the Siamese Cube, only there are
three cubes connected, and unlike the Siames Cube, each new cube rises
a level -- a row of one corner and an edge are aligned with the next
cube's edge and the other corner (ie one is bottom corner and edge,
joining the other cube's edge and top corner).  This also comes with
a display case.

The mechanism for the Gem is likely just a 2x2x2 cube mechanism, but the
pieces?  The 14-sider looks ALL new, though with 8 centers, maybe it's
some kind of octahedron shape variation?

With the Siamese and Triple cubes you could just have a few different
pieces swapping out the originals -- is someone just making the new
pieces?

Are these homemade, prototypes, original puzzles by pirate manufacturers?
Does anybody know?

Hello, cube-lovers,
it is my pleasure to infoem you that a poll conducted by aol.com voted
the Rubik's cube as fad of the century. 10 fads were listed and our
little obsession (at least for some of us) was on the very top of the
list.

Congratulations, Rubik's cube!

PS IMHO, the cube is more than a fad!

The World Puzzle Championship was held last week in Budapest, Hungary.
Erno Rubik was invited to kick off the opening ceremonies (so I got
a few pictures of him, woo hoo!).

There was only one cube-related puzzle in the competition, however.

Contestants were given a picture of an unsolved Rubik's Cube and asked
to identify the center face colors on the unseen three faces.  Perhaps
not too challenging (although I'm sure many will find problem 3 
difficult to do without pencil and paper).  You can find the puzzles
at http://www.rubiks.com/  or the specific URLs:

http://www.rubiks.com/puzzles.html?p=rubiks_cube&q=1
http://www.rubiks.com/puzzles.html?p=rubiks_cube&q=2
http://www.rubiks.com/puzzles.html?p=rubiks_cube&q=3

If you think these puzzles are too easy, I have an added question
for you -- what is the minimum number of moves needed to get a 
solved cube into the states depicted by the three problems?  You will
find problem 1 easy, problem 2 intermediate, and problem 3 difficult.

That's kind of what I thought.  The OddzOn cubes are represented by

Yep, I found Meffert's site.  I hear he's also planning 4x4x4 & 5x5x5

Glad to hear it.  Tell me though, is there any chance we'll see some of

hexagonal, pentagonal and the two circular, prisms?

It occurs to me that even though there isn't an auction running currently
with that, you could search for it.  Trouble is, the title was something
lame like "blah blah Rubik blah blah EXTREMELY RARE", which will match
other stuff too...  On the other hand, it might have been auctioned by
the same ssongas (sp?) guy who's auctioning off the Siamese/Triple/Gem
puzles, so a search for him in completed auctions might find it.  I can't
get to the web right now to do it myself, but will try to look later.
Actually, it might have said "14-sided" in the title, which would be
easy to find...

Well, I guess I meant like the Siamese cubes still requiring two cubes to
make one Siamese, so the cubes to make it would be pirated, even if the SC
itself wasn't.  Same with the Pyramorphix going to the Gem & Starburst.
But point taken.  And in this case, obviously somebody with a good supply
of OddzOn cubes and ?? Pyramorphix and some time & talent out to make a
good buck or a hundred.


Again, thanks all!

of what appears to actually be a 2x2x4 puzzle in its Puzzle Museum.
How does that work?

  I'd love some more elaboration of the specific sequences the
original poster used.  (or any suggestions others have to make) I
think this would be quite a trick.  I'd be happy just being able to do
a 2x2x2 cube like this or maybe one face of a 3x3x3...

Hi All Cube Lovers,

Just to clarify some point asked below.  I will be releasing original
Siamese cubes, utilizing our Patented Assembly cube parts plus 3 new
connectors so that multiple cubes can be assembled / disassembled. These
will be available for shipping  around the 10th of December.  Also the 4x4x4
cube and our New Pyraminx Diamond Puzzle made from a Skewb mechanism with
new pieces so that you have 6 pyramid apexes and 8 triangles making an
Octahedron. Furthermore there will be bandaged cube with molded tiles
using the assembly cube mechanism. By using the parts of 2 Pyramorphix's I
will be offering a limited number of Star of David and Diamond Puzzles as a
collectors set, also with our new molded tile finish.  Also some New Disney
& Donald Puzzle Heads using our patented 2x2x2 mechanism will be available

Solving one face of a 3x3x3 in one look does not require any special
system for planning.  If it can be done in 20-25 moves, then I've found
it is feasible (although cumbersome) to simply plan out all 20 moves
while keeping track of each move's effect on the relevant pieces.

If you are interested in solving the whole cube in 1-look,
(or a 2x2x2 cube) I suggest you try doing 2 looks first:
1 to solve corners (without changing edges), 1 to solve edges.
Once you can do this, it should be clear how to do it in one look.
If 2-looks for the whole cube is still too difficult at first, then
try solving just the corners with 2-looks, 1 to position them
and 1 to orient them correctly. (But don't mess up
the edges while you do it!)

You don't really have to "update" your memory as you go,
because you can basically plan out the entire solution before
you start, as follows:

1. it's only 3-5 corner permutations to get all corners in the
correct location, and you just have to keep track of each
corner's orientation (i.e., needs to be rotated clockwise or
anti-clockwise in place).
For these permutation moves, I most often use a single-layer
3-corner interchange that preserves the corner orientation
relative to that layer. The move [Ri F Ri B2 R Fi Ri B2 R2]
accomplishes this in the top layer.

2. 1-3 more sequences to orient all the corners.
I use simple moves like [(R U Ri Ui)^2 D (U R Ui Ri)^2 Di]  to
re-orient two corners in the bottom layer.

(**Now you've SOLVED a 2x2x2 Cube!**)

3. Then usually 5-7 sequences to put all edges in place,
but again keeping track of which ones are flipped.
For these permutations, I will again often use a 3-edge swap
like the following: [R2 Ui Fs R2 Bs Ui R2]

4. then a few more edge-flip sequences.  I use the (very)
inefficient two-edge flip maneuver:
[Ls Fi Ls Di Ls B2 Rs Di Rs Fi Rs U2]

Then you're done! (about 200 moves later.)
This is not an easy "trick" - I still find it quite
challenging to correctly plan out the entire corners solution
and the entire edges solution, and to then implement them
correctly from memory.

The real "trick" for me is that I don't memorize the
locations of the pieces, just the sequence of permutations
that I planned out to solve them. This way, if you can plan
out the 5 corner permutations in advance, then you only
need to remember those 5 items to solve the corners, which don't
change throughout the solution. If you instead memorize the
locations of the pieces, you have to keep memorizing new
locations throughout the solution. (which is impossible for me.)

I first plan out the entire solution with my eyes open, and memorize it.
(planning it out correctly may be the most difficult part.)
Then you only have 15 permutations to remember and execute
correctly, without any new memorization after you close your
eyes.

Well, that's enough about that. I just want to make this approach clear
because I think blindfolded cubing is well within the bounds of "normal
human memory capabilities."

Good Luck!

Subject: Rubik's cube?
Date: Sun, 31 Oct 1999 12:58:08 +0100

Last week I found a puzzle that looks like something between my old
Rubik's cube and my pyracube.

It has 14 faces: 6 are squares and 8 triangles.

Imagine one side of the pyracube: a square in the middle, and four
little triangles in the corners.

Now when you look at the whole pyracube, the little triangles form 8
pyramids. Then virtually remove these pyramids and you have the shape
of my new puzzle.

In addition it is cut (?) like a Rubik's cube, and consequently has
the same solution.

Have you ever seen this puzzle? was it made by rubik? How is it
called?  Well, I want ot know everything about it since I've been
collecting all rubiks cube-like puzzles for a few years.

Thanks in advance,
Paul

I'm not sure what you and Dan have discovered.

[ Moderator's Note: I should have been less coy.  I thought Joe
  Johnson might not have discovered that the supergroup contains
  positions in which a face center is rotated 180 degrees.  I still
  think this is surprising. It's so easy to rotate the face centers
  by an amount adding up to an integral number of 360-degree
  rotations (see 9 January 1981 in the archives).  Does anyone have a
  short process for rotating two face centers 90 degrees clockwise?
  --Dan ]

What I have found is that the cross cubies and wing cubies are both
involved in parity problems. i.e. if you repair the parity of the
cross cubies then there will be no parity problems with the wing
cubies, if you leave the parity problem with the cross cubies then
there will be a parity problem with the wing cubies.  One fix repairs
both.  The point cubies and edge cubies never have parity problems;
simple 3 cubie exchanges are all that are necessary to place the point
cubies (the only cubies that require orientation are the face, corner,
and edge cubies - the others are automatically oriented correctly when
they are placed correctly.)

http://www.rubiks.com/cubemain.html claims that over 200 million have
been sold.

The Rubik's Games CD-ROM has a history of the cube that includes other

My latest addiction has been sliding puzzles, sequential movement puzzles
that are very Rubik-like in nature...I have found a couple of places online
that have are particularly interesting (see below).  I have solved (with the
aid of a program) 44 of the 49 puzzles, and 4 more are just a matter of time
(the states are large but not too large).

However one puzzle, the "Climb Pro 24", by Minoru Abe (link below) is beyond
my program's reach.  It has far too many combinations for my state program
to solve it.

This is where the cube lovers come in.  How do I design a program to solve
this puzzle?  Any ideas or algorithms would be appreciated, especially on
how to reduce the decision tree and know when you've repeated a state
without keeping all of the states in memory.

Regardless if I ever figure out a solution, I know lots of you will enjoy
the following,

Hello Puzzle-Fans,

  I am wondering if anyone could comment on the use of twisty puzzles
(like rubik cube, etc) for those people who suffered a stroke and are
paralyzed slightly on one side and need to exercise their hands.
(The reason I'm asking is because my brother-in-law suffered a stroke
and he needs to exercise his left hand.)   I am wondering if these
types of puzzles are good therapy or a bad idea.  One exercise he does
with his wife is to close his eyes and hold an object in his left hand
and try to figure out its shape (cube, sphere, tetrahedral, etc...)
Any comments, suggestions, references?

Thanks you.

	I'm doing this from memory.  If you want, I can look up what I wrote
about 20 years ago.
	Ideal told me they sold about 20 million cubes in one year - I think
this was in the US.  Polytechnika said they sold about twice (or several) times
as many cubes in Hungary as there were people, making perhaps 10 million.  Both
of these statements were while the cube craze was in midstream.  So I suspect
that somewhere between 50 and 100 million legitimiate cubes were sold.  However
the pirate cubes sold perhaps twice as many.  So I've generally given an
estimate of 200 million!  I think this may be conservative, but the number was
probably somewhere between 100 and 300 million.  This doesn't take account of
the fact that the fad started rather later in the Communist countries and they
may have produced many millions as well, though I don't think this would make a

Subject: Square-1 Question

Greetings:

After many months of trying pattern after pattern, I've developed an
algorithm for swapping two adjacent corner pieces on Square-1. I was hoping
that if I posted what I've come up with, that someone might have an easier
method. Who knows? Maybe I've just put a new spin on an old solution to this
move, or re-discovered an existing pattern. Anyhow, I'd love to get some
feedback on it. Here's what I've got:

* All moves are done with the orange side facing you, yellow on the left.
* T   = Top Slice [white in this case]
* R   = Right-Hand Slice [blue]
* B   = Bottom Slice [green]
* L   = Left-Hand Slice [yellow]
* CW  = Clock Wise
* CCW = Counter Clock Wise
* CW and CCW moves are done from the perspective of tilting the cube and
looking at the side in question.
* This series of moves will swap the two bottom corner pieces on the blue
side.

MOVES [From a perfect cube - orange on front]
*****

T [1/8 CW], R [1/2], B [1/4 CCW], T [1/2], R [1/2], B [1/4 CW], T [1/2], R
[1/2], B [1/4 CCW], T [1/2], R [1/2], B [1/4 CCW], T [1/4 CW], L [1/2], T
[1/4 CW], L [1/2], T [1/8 CW], B [1/2]

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. Now that I have
my own, I won't mind borrowing a simpler one!

Subject: centre slice table
From: ronald.fletterman@t-online.de (Ronald Fletterman)


cubologist proper remember how much time and effort was spent in
generating the table of all maneuvers, concerning one outer slice of
the 3x3x3 cube.(the so-called upper table). John F. Jarvis seems to be
the first to have published the table (in 1983), but his maneuver
lengths challenged the brothers dockhorn to get the max length down to
16 moves (1 move equals either a 90 degree or 180 degree face
turn). upto now, little attention has been paid to the centre slice
table per se.  digging into my files, i found a study by herbert
kociemba, including the centre slice maneuvers. to me, it belongs to
the files of every cubologist; ref. the attachement, which can be
opened by owners of kociemba's cube explorer. rgds

Subject: Megaminx 2 edge swap
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

For a long time i thought and heard that the 2 edge swap was impossible on a
megaminx as it is simply a platonic dodecahedron in rubiks format, and a 2
edge swap on a rubiks cube is impossible. yet i have many times solved my
megaminx down to where there are only 2 edges swapped, then randomized it,
and solved again only to find the problem nonexistant. apparently there is
some way to swap only two edges. If anyone knows this move sequence please
tell me. thank you.

-Harlequin

[Moderator's note: It is impossible to perform an odd permutation of
 the edges of the Megaminx, because 5-cycles are even.  This is not
 the same situation as with Rubik's cube, where it is possible to
 perform an odd permutation of the edges if an odd permutation of the
 corners is also performed.  Did they use the same color for more than
 one face of the Megaminx?  Is there another way to get fooled? --Dan]

The MegaMinx in Puzzler has only 6 colors. When I contacted the author
about it, he told me that the one he got only had those 6 colors. When
I got mine (2 years back), it had 12 colors.

I'm not sure if I've ever run into that problem described above. On second
thought, I have...

Let me describe what I do to solve a MegaMinx. I hope you can follow what
I'm saying, because it's hard to describe this... I'll try to make
some pictures... Ok, I stole one from the alt.ascii-art group:

             _._
         _,-'/\ '-._
    _,.-'1  /2 \   3`-.._
 .'________/____\________'.
 :'-.  4  /      \  6  ,-':
 :   '-, /   5    \ ,-'   :
 :  7   /-.      ,-\   10,:
 `:    /   '-,.-'   \    :
  :.  /  8 ,-''-. 9  \  .:
  `: /  ,-'      '-.  \ :
 & :/,-'     11     '-.\: %
   `'-................-''


First, I solve one layer. This includes the pieces 1, 2, 3 and 5 on the
5 layers adjeacent to the top. Then, I put in the edge pieces 4 and 6.
Next, I put in the corner pieces 7 and 10. All of these can be done
using standard 3x3x3 moves :-)

Putting in 8 and 9 requires a trick. You have to rotate the layers
indicated by & and % so that the pieces 8 and 9 can be reached from the
'bottom' layer. Then, use standard 3x3x3 moves to swing the edge pieces
from the bottom layer to pieces 8 and 9. I always find this process to
take the longest (you need to put in 10 edges. Because of Murphy's law,
the edge pieces you need are probably in the 'same' positions in other
layers, so you need to take them out before you can put them in. Long
work, indeed).

Next, put in the corner piece 11.

Now, the upper half of the MegaMinx is solved.

Next, put in the edge pieces on the second-to-last layer (easy work),
and we're down to the last layer.

First, I put the edge pieces in the correct _position_. Sometimes, I need
two edges to be swapped. The formula I have excahnges three edges, so I
mess around with it until I have them all in the correct position.

Then, I align edges, position corners (using a three-corner exchange
formula), and align corners. The last two steps usually impose no
problems.

Unfortunately, my notes with Megaminx formulas is at home (we found
them back yesterday..), so I can't look up any formulas.

If people are interested in the formulas I use, or in the way I solve
it, let me know and I'll look up my notes.

The current Megaminx uses only six colours.  We had a discussion about
the ambiguities this creates in January 1998, to be found in the
archives in cube-mail-24.

Subject: MegaMinx notes
Date: Sat, 11 Dec 1999 22:34:41 +0100

I just found back my notes on the MegaMinx. Here's what I have.
It isn't much, because I solve it as a 'regular' cube, with
the exception of a few formulas.

The last layer needs these steps:
- Correctly flip the edge pieces.

I use the formulas F U R U' R' F' to flip the 'Front' and
'Right' upper edge pieces. F R U R' U' F' flips the 'Front'
and 'Right-back' upper edge pieces.

Repeat one of these formulas as needed.

- Correctly align the edge pieces.

I have two formulas for this as well. Formula 1 assumes that
the edge pieces 'Front' and 'Left' are correctly aligned, and
keeps these in place: R U R' U R U2 R' rotates the other three
edge pieces around.

Formula 2 assumes that the edge pieces 'Front' and 'Left-back'
are correctly aligned, and keeps these in place: R U R' U2 R U
R' rotates the other three edge pieces around.

- Correctly align the corner pieces.

I only have on of these. The two corner pieces in the 'R' layer
are kept in the same position: U2 R U2' L' U2 R' U2' L (note the
notation: U2 is not the same as U2'!) rotates the other three
corner pieces around.

- Correctly flip the corner pieces.

The formula I've used for 20 years (is this possible? When I
started cubing, I was quite small. I can't really remember
when it was) is the following: Use R F' R' F  R F' R' F to
rotate the corner piece FRU clockwise. Repeat until this piece
is correctly aligned. Then, rotate the U layer until you find
another corner piece that's not correctly flipped. Repeat the
formula until it's correctly flipped (later, I found out that
F' R F R'  F' R F R' rotates a corner piece in the ccw
direction). This also works nicely on the Megaminx.


What I like in my solution of the last layer of the Megaminx:
- The formulas are 'standard' Cube moves, adapted for another
  geometry.
- Most only use three layers. Only one (conceptually) uses 4
  layers (The one to align corner pieces). Since the three
  layers meeting at every corner of the Megaminx are identical
  in behaviour as the layers of the Cube, the formulas are easy
  to grasp (and were easy to adapt from the Cube moves).

Lots of manuals coming with cubes nowadays use the E layer for
some goals (I have to admit: My formulas for the Cube include
this one for the Edge pieces on the third layer: (R E)4, then
rotate the upper layer until another incorrectly flipped edge
piece is in the UR position). These can clearly _not_ be 'ported'
to the Megaminx.

My time for solving the Megaminx is about 10 minutes. My Cube
time is still about 3 minutes (I know, I know: Layer-by-layer
is _not_ a fast approach...)

Well, that's all I have to say about the Megaminx for now...

Happy Minxing!

The program has other facilities as well.  You can set a mode whereby
each input line, rather than being applied to a clean cube, is applied
to the last-printed cube; this is what you'd want if you wanted to try
actually solving a cube using it.  There are also ways to save and load
files containing user-defined transformations.  Twenty transformations
are predefined: the six face quarter-turns, the six quarter-turns of
the whole cube, the six SLICEx turns, NOOP (which has no effect), and
LAST (which refers to the operation that carries a clean cube into the
last-printed cube).  Parentheses group, numeric suffixes repeat what
they apply to, ' takes the inverse, and * `centers' - it takes what it
applies to and concatenates it with whole-cube rotations as necessary
to return the face-center cubies to their home cubicles.

The program is 1308 lines long (34106 bytes) and does require gcc to
compile (it uses nonlocal gotos, nested functions a la Pascal, and
block expressions with nested functions to get lambda functions), but
other than that it should be fairly portable - there's stuff that's
compiler-dependent but not much that's OS-dependent, I think.  I'll be
happy to mail a copy to anyone who wants; if anyone cares to put it up
to be generally fetchable, that's fine with me.

Subject: rubiks hat or rabbit
Date: Sun, 19 Dec 1999 15:49:09 +0100

Hello,

Two days ago I bought a rubiks rabbit.  It is really amazing, and is
more complicated than it looks. Here is the description found in the
archives:

"Rubik's Hat is in the form of a hat with six rings on it. You can
look through it (and through the rings by implication). By turning
rings you see more or less rabbits. The purpose is to see a rabbit in
every position.

I think the puzzle is based on light polarization, with different
polarizations coming through the segments of the rings."

I'm not entirely satisfied with the explanation. Light polarisation
doesn't have this effect on colours, and polarisation lens are too
much expensive to be used. I think this effect is due to simple light
filters (green, red, yellow or a mix of two of these colours). If the
filter is red (=retain all other wave lenghths), then you will only
see red rabbits.

But there is something I can't explain: in one segment I saw a green
rabbit. then I turn a ring and this rabbit disappears. I concluded
that the segment of the ring retains green light. Then I tried all
other colours to see what light could pass through. When i turn this
same ring on another green segment, then I was able to see the rabbit
through it! This was of course not the same rabbit, and in one case
the green rabbit was there and in the other, not, all that with the
same filter!

Could somebody explain that? Do you have any other explanation of this
puzzle?

I've tried my best to explain that in english, but feel free to ask me
for more details,

Bye,
Paul

Subject: Square-1 tables of move sequences
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

Dear Cube-Lovers,

I have just computed many new results for the Square-1 puzzle. I have
written a program that applies a Kociemba-like algorithm to this puzzle,
and used it to find many beautifully short sequences for nearly all
standard moves of the edges and corners.

This post is very long, and will list most of the results. First however
I should quickly describe the puzzle and highlight some of its intricacies,
since these might not be overly familiar even though it has been mentioned
on this list in the past.

--
Short description of the Square-1 puzzle:

This puzzle is a cube consisting of three layers. The top and bottom layers
are cut like a pie in 8 pieces; 4 edge pieces and 4 corner pieces, 30 and 60
degrees wide respectively. The top and bottom layers can rotate. The middle
layer is cut in only two halves along one of the lines of the other layers.
If there are no corner pieces in the way, you can twist half the cube 180
degrees so that pieces from the top and bottom layers mingle.

The puzzle is unique in that the two types of pieces intermingle. The edge
and corner pieces can freely move between the two outer layers. Of course,
the puzzle will not necessarily be a cube shape when the pieces are mixed.
The puzzle has six colours, each face has a single colour similar to the
Rubik's cube. The aim is of course to return a mixed puzzle back to its
original solved position.

The number of positions:
There are three categories of puzzle shapes.
  a. Both layers have 4 edges and 4 corners each.
  b. One layer has 3 corners, 6 edges, the other 5 corners 2 edges.
  c. One layer has 2 corners, 8 edges, the other 6 corners and no edges.

There are 1, 3, 10, 10 and 5 layer shapes with 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2 corners.
This means there are 5*1+10*3+10*10+3*10+1*5 = 170 shape combinations
for the top and bottom layers (all of them can be attained). The middle layer
has two shapes because half of it is assumed to be in a fixed position and
only the other half moves. This means that there seem to be 170*2*8!*8! =
552,738,816,000 positions if we disregard rotations of the layers. Some
layer shapes however have symmetry, and these have been counted too
many times this way.

To take account of the symmetries we can simply count the number of layer
shapes differently. Instead of the numbers 1, 3, 10, 10, 5 we use the
numbers 2, 36, 105, 112, 54, which are the number of shapes if we consider
rotations different (e.g. a square counts as 3 because it has three possible
orientations). By the same method as before we then get 19305*2*8!*8!
or 627,768,369,664,000 positions.

To exclude layer rotations, divide by 12^2 to get a total of 435,891,456,000
distinct positions.

--
Notation

I use a different notation to that found on other places on the web,
because I find this one more descriptive. Hold the puzzle so that the
yellow middle layer piece is on the left hand side with its 'Square-1'
inscription the right way up. Denote a 180 degree turn of the right hand
side of the puzzle by a / sign (a slash). Turns of the top and bottom
layers are denoted by a pair of numbers (n,m). These numbers are the
multiple of 30 degrees clockwise that the top/bottom layers are to turn
respectively. Thus (3,0) means turn only the top layer clockwise 90
degrees, and (0,-1) means turn only the bottom layer 30 degrees
anti-clockwise (i.e. one edge along).

Note that I define the LENGTH OF A SEQUENCE of moves simply as the
number of / moves in it.

By labelling the faces by the letters U, D, L, R, F, B in the standard
way for the Rubik's cube, the pieces of Square-1 can also be denoted
in the usual way; a combination of two letters for an edge piece and
three letters for a corner piece.

--
Subtleties of the puzzle

Generally the puzzle is solved by first bringing its shape back to a cube,
and then placing the pieces correctly. The reason for this is that there
are many moves that keep the top an bottom layers square, for example
(1,0)/(0,-1). Each / does of course change the middle layer shape from a
square to a kite shape, but this can be ignored because /(0,6)/(0,6)/(0,6)
affects only the middle layer. Ignoring the middle layer, a cube can be
formed in at most 7 moves.

A difficulty arises from the fact that these cube moves swaps two pairs
of corners and two pairs of edges, which is an even permutation. The pieces
can however end up in an odd permutation. To solve this, you will have to
leave the cube shape behind. One way is by doing /(3,3)/(1,2)/ which brings
together four corner pieces in each layer. Now (2,-2)/(-2,2) will swap
three pairs of corners, and by reversing the previous moves we can return
to a cube. As you can see this has taken 7 moves, and in fact there is no
shorter way of performing an odd permutation on the cube.

--
The Search Algorithm

The search algorithm in my program is very similar in design to the
Kociemba algorithm for solving the Rubik's cube, as it solves it in two
stages and uses tables to prune the search tree.

During the first stage of the search a position is found in which the
top and bottom layers are square and where the pieces lie in an even
permutation. The second stage will then solve it with moves that keep
the top and bottom layers square.

The first stage uses a single look-up table, that holds the number of
moves needed to bring the puzzle to a cube from the current shape. It is
only when the cube shape is reached that the parity of the permutation is
checked. In the future I may try to build a larger table which combines
the permutation parity with the shape.

The second stage uses in effect two look-up tables, one for the edges and
one for the corners, and the number of moves needed to solve them is given.
In reality the two tables are identical since cube-moves swap corners and
edges in the same way.

In virtually all other aspects the two phase search is performed in the
same manner as the Kociemba algorithm, so I need not explain further.
The only remaining difference is that my program continues searching for
sequences of the same length as any already found. My reason for this is
that some sequences require fewer turns of the top and bottom layers, and
are therefore better despite being of the same length as defined above.

--
Results

I suspect that God's algorithm (the shortest possible way of solving any
position) uses at most about 12 moves. Clearly this cannot be proved with
this program, but nearly all the positions I have tried can be done in 12
or fewer moves.

Most of the results that I have found using this program are on my website.

Subject: Meffert's web-site

Hi,

I've tried to go to Uwe Meffert's web-site, but have been unable to
open it (http://www.mefferts-puzzles.com). Also, I tried www.ue.net
(another site made by Meffert). Does anyone know why the sites are
down?

[Moderator's note: CvW followed up with a note that the site is now
 named www.mefferts.com. --Dan]

On a side note, this weekend I 'constructed' a 12-spot on a Megaminx.
It's not as simple as it looks. After that, I constructed the
pattern that looks like U2 D2 R2 L2 F2 B2 on the Cube (is this
called 'Pons Asinorum'?). Only, the colors are not always the ones
of the oposite sides of the MegaMinx.

Is it possible to make the 12-spot and the other pattern in an easy
way when I start with a 'clean' MegaMinx? I've seen formulas for
the 10-spot already.


Regards,

Christ van Willegen

Would please comment on http://www.iteration-gmbh.de/Erubik.html
[ or on the German version http://www.iteration-gmbh.de/Rubik.htm ].
They have an animation which appears to be solving a 6x6x6 cube.

This is possibly related to the English page at
http://www2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~jacob/Evolvica/ES-GA/
ga_magic_problem.html

which shows screen shots of a solver program. I looked at ftp
site and the program doesn't appear to be available, although the
magic square program and a few others are in
ftp://ftp-bionik.fb10.tu-berlin.de/pub/ESdemo/

What then are the prospects of using these methods for cube solving?
While it may be a bit much for them to produce optimal solutions
(or maybe not!), for 4x4x4 and larger the suboptimal solutions may
still be very useful.

Subject: Re: Square-1 tables of move sequences
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu


Dear Cube-Lovers,

Here are my latest and probably final Square-One results.

I have finalised my square-1 solving program, and it can now be downloaded from
my website. I managed to speed it up so much that it can do an exhaustive depth
9 search in a few hours on a fast pc. It has thus confirmed that all the
sequences below of length <=10 are minimal (though there might be other
sequences that are easier to perform).

The only sequences that are more than 10 long are A13 and C5, and these are 11
and 12 moves respectively. I have no plans as yet to do longer searches on
these two.

Here are the move tables. I will quote them in full, even though many are the
same as in my previous post.

Subject: Rubik's Revenge by Oddzon
References: <000701bf442c$151f8420$ea023dd4@wschwi>

Oddzon recently decided to manufacture a limited run of Rubik's
Revenges.  My understanding is that they originally made 250 for sale
but the cubes were so popular that they made another 250.  All 500
initial cubes are gone.

Here's the URL to the Rubik's page about the status of the Revenge:  It
will return to production.

http://www.rubiks.com/revenge.html

I recently picked up a couple of these prototype Revenges to compare
them to the original Ideal runs of the early 80's.  As far as I can
tell, Ideal had two different sets of Revenges made.  The first set is
from Macau.  Its mechanism is initially quite stiff and squeaks a lot
when turned.  This can eventually loosen up to a pretty smooth turning
mechanism.  It's made of stiff plastic which leads me to believe that
this would be the one more easily broken due to the potential
brittleness of the pieces.  The other Revenge is manufactured in Korea. 
This particular cube is made from a softer plastic and turns much more
smoothly than the Macau cube when brand new.  The drawback of the Korea
cube IMHO is that the cubelets are hollow.  Although both sets of cubes
seem to be injection molded, the Korean cube has "cheaped out" and left
the cubes hollow, which in my experience causes quite a bit of binding
in teh cube unless the planes of rotation are perfectly aligned. 
Neither puzzle is what I would consider a pleasure to work with.

Enter the Oddzon Cube.  It didn't come in a fancy box at all; just in a
simple plastic baggie and taped shut.  While the turning itself is a bit
rough feeling, the puzzle doesn't seem to bind at all and very little
pressure is required.  The plastic seems to be similar to the Korean
cube's softness but the cubelets are not hollow, which means no binding
and very forgiving about not having perfect alignment.  Unfortunately it
appears that the puzzle currently suffers from Oddzon's really cheap
laminated paper stickers.  According to their web site this puzzle is
only a prototype, so maybe they will improve the mechanism as well as
stick to using purely plastic stickers in their final production cubes. 
This will be THE Revenge I play with, not just because it will be in
production, but because it is by far the best feeling.  

If anybody doubts my claim to the puzzle's smoothness, I will gladly
send them one of my Oddzon Revenges.  I am willing to part with two of
them just so you can get a feel for the mechanism.  I will choose two
people to receive the cubes (chosen at my discretion) for an
evaluation.  If you don't think the puzzle is smooth, just mail it back
to me and I'll cover the postage.  However if you find the cube as good
as I do, be so kind as to mail me the cost of the cube and postage
(about 24 bucks).  

Please don't take this as an advertisement, but rather an endorsement
from someone who has found the ultimately Revenge cube to date.

Date: Sun, 16 Jan 2000 11:48:38 -0500

I haven't seen many of this posts in this list since most posts are
technical but I thought it wouldn't hurt to share a Cube experience.

Last time I was at a friend's house (a friend I don't visit very often) I
saw a cube laying somewhere and I started playing with it and telling my
friend how I liked the cube, we made a contest to see who could solve it
faster.

The cube is just like the first cube I had, one of those cubes that turn vey
nicely and that the cubies align when you twist the sides, it has stickers
instead of tiles and they are kind of worn off.  My friend says he bought
this cube with his father some 18 or 19 years ago. To me this is an original
cube since here where I live you can not (and never been able to) find those
cubes manufatured by the companies mentioned in this list.

[Moderator's note: The Wonderful Puzzler brand was mentioned in six
 cube-lovers messages from 1981.  Besides the knockoff Rubik's cube,
 they made a keychain version and an octagonal prism version.]

Yesterday I went again to this friend's house and he told me the cube would
be better in my hands and he gave it to me! It comes in its original
cardboard box that reads: Wonderful Puzzler on the top, on two sides it has
a drawing of a scrambled cube and in the other two sides a solved cube and
it reads Can you contend with more than 3,000,000,000 combination (without
the "S") to reach the solution? On the bottom it reads Made in Taiwan

Well thats all a simple story I just wanted to share

I don't know... I found it really distubing that they couldn't even be
bothered to change the sticker to read "Rubik's Revenge" instead of
"Rubik's Cube", and I've heard from some people that the OddzOn version
fell apart as soon as they turned it once. I picked up a Meffert's
version. Not only is it $2 less than the OddzOn version and shipped free
worldwide, but it's also apparently designed for speed cubing. Instead of
using stickers of any kind, Meffert decided to go with tiles for all his
puzzles, which definitely aren't coming off any time soon. To add to the
challenge, Meffert grooved all the tiles, so if you'd like you can also
treat it as a junior version of a picture cube (junior because there's
still pairs of centres which are completely indistibguishable). L8r.

The problem is that the Alexander's Star uses only 6 colours instead of
the usual 12, so you get pairs of pieces all over the puzzle that look
identical. What you need to do is find a piece that is identical to one of
the pieces that need swapping, and then do a 3 piece rotation on them.

Since we are sharing stories, I just thought I'd mention how I found a
scrambled cube at the local Salvation Army Thrift Store.  It cost me 18
cents (0.18 USD).  I tried to solve it but I found out the plastic stickers
were removed and rearranged into an impossible position.  The neat thing
is that I believe it is an original Ideal; but I am not sure.  It really
turns smoothly and lines up easily; it is a fantastic cube for speed solving.
Is there a way I can find out what brand it is?  It doesn't say on the white
sticker, I think it wore off.  (this is a 3by cube)

I purchase the Oddzon Revenge during it's first initial run.  I have played
with it alot, and it's mechanism is quite nice.  It is as good as my
original Revenge.  So, I can support Jin's claim.

As far as the stickers go, we all know that the plastic laminated stickers
that Oddzon uses do not last if you plan on playing with the puzzle.  This
is still true with the "new" Revenges.  Even if you do not plan on speed
cubing with it, the oils in ones hands gets under the lamination and it ends
up folding up, making it annoying to play with.

I have found a temporary fix for this.  I found at the hardware store
(almost any commercial hardware store should do) that they sell electrical
tape in several colors.  Since electrical tape is vinyl, it will stand up to
abuse.  I bought all six (identically the same as the original) colors in
1/4 inch width size.  This is definatly a good fix, since you don't have to
"ruin" the cube (i.e. painting) the plastic cubies.

I say that this is a temporary fix, because from what I understand, starting
in Febuary, Uwe Meffert is going to offer plastic tiles for sale, so cubist
can fix up are old worn out stickers on their puzzles.  He already offers
plastic tiles for 3X3X3 cubes for one dollar per color (each color includes
9 tiles for all cubies on one side).  This is an incredible option, because
not only will we be able to restore our puzzles back to excelent condition,
we will be able to create more custom color arrangements.

Subject: Stuff...

Hi everyone!

This is my first post to Cube-Lovers! I don't really know whether most
people on this mailing list are regulars or just a bunch of strangers
who don't know each other, but I'll introduce myself anyway. I am:
Justin Ghan, recently turned 18 year old, about to start his second
year of Engineering/Science at Adelaide University, South Australia. I
wasn't really interested in all this cube stuff until the middle of
last year ... Well, when I was really young, my cousin had a pyraminx
and I solved that. But yeah, last July, I got one of my friends to
teach me how to solve the Rubik's Cube, which I have ever since
regretted, since I really would have liked to solve it myself...

Since then, I've bought a Megaminx from Meffert's and also won a
Professor Cube (thanks to the Puzzle Challenge!). I solved both of
them mostly using altered Rubik's Cube sequences, which sort of
dampened my satisfaction because I knew I didn't REALLY fully solve
them myself. I borrowed a friend's Creative Puzzle Ball (I'm not sure
what it's officially called) and managed to be able to solve it in a
trial-and-error sort of way.  I also bought a Bandaged Cube recently,
which arrived only yesterday and is annoying the hell out of me - I've
only solved it once by accident so far. And I wasn't paying attention
so I don't know how I did it. I've also got a Square-One and a Skewb
Diamond coming in the mail. I can't wait!

I was a bit intimidated when I read through the past couple of years
worth of Cube-Lovers mail because I always thought I was pretty smart
at maths (I went to the International Mathematical Olympiad twice) and
was also pretty proud of my puzzling skills but I couldn't make head
nor tail of most of the mathematical discussion! I've been trying to
learn some group theory since, so I hope one day I'll be able to join
in.

Anyway, I have quite a few unrelated questions I need help with...

First of all, the glue on my Megaminx is failing, meaning that every
time I turn a face I have to pause to readjust all the stickers which
have slid out of place. This is obviously very annoying. Any ideas on
what to do? What type of glue could I use to secure all the stickers
more permanently? By the way, I really like the grooved tiles on the
Bandaged Cube (and all the new Meffert's Puzzles, I think), although
the colours aren't as bright.

Now for the Professor Cube ... I've seen various solutions on the
internet but so far I haven't found anybody else who uses the boring
layer by layer approach. Does anybody else do it my way? It's probably
a really slow, inefficient method but it seemed the most obvious to me
when I started, since that's how I solved the Rubik's Cube and the
Megaminx. The reason I ask is that I would really like a fix for the
parity problem when I get to the last layer. When I end up with two
edge pieces swapped, I have to stuff up the last two layers
completely, which takes ages to redo.

I've been considering buying an Assembly Cube since, believe it or
not, I don't actually have a Rubik's Cube (although I can use the
Professor Cube as one). But I don't really know much about them.
What's going on with the 3-colour Assembly Cube at Meffert's? Also, if
I buy a Assembly Siamese Cube, can I use it to assemble a normal
Rubik's Cube? And what's the Alexander's Star? And I thought I saw a
"Star of David" (or something) mentioned on the Meffert's website...

Finally, I decided today to try my hand at some programming. Now, I
haven't had any programming experience except for extremely basic
BASIC, years and years ago on my Commodore 64. But I wanted to see if
I could write a program to solve the Bandaged Cube, so I tried to
learn some QBASIC. I thought it would be easier to solve a 2x2x2 cube
first, so I finally managed to write a working program to do that. It
was just a brute force search, first testing all 1 move algorithms,
then 2 move algorithms, etc.

I thought I was pretty good until I discovered that my program took 18
minutes to check all the 9 move algorithms! (I have a Pentium II 266,
although not being very computer smart I'm not sure how much
difference this makes.) I found out that more than half the
configurations required 9 moves or more. Well, this was pretty
embarrassing, considering that there are computer programs which can
solve the 3x3x3 in seconds (or so I've read, I haven't tried any of
these programs). So I'm wondering how to write a fast solver. Is my
program slow because of my bad programming skills, or is my method
just plain slow? I can't think of any other methods to find the
solution.

I hope some of you can help with my problems. I also realise that some
of my questions may have been answered in past discussions, but I
wasn't willing to read through 20 years of archives to find out! If
you can direct me to a previous relevant discussion, that would also
be appreciated.

Thanks!

Justin

Subject: Ideas for new puzzles

Dear Cube-Lovers,

  As I twist and turn, I often think, wouldn't it be great
if this puzzle did this.  After discovering Jaap Scherphuis'
page on puzzle info, I thought I should put my ideas forward.
If these have already appeared, then please don't take offense,
I am not stealing, just reinventing the wheel.  If anyone knows
if these puzzles already exist, I would very much appreciate
hearing about them.  If these puzzles don't exist, then I
offer my ideas as a challenge to any puzzle manufacturers, and
puzzle designers, who may read this news letter.

  As I twisted my skewb, to prove to myself that it is very
similar to the Magic Pyramid, I thought, I would like to swap
corners from one group (of 4) to the other group.  Super-
imposing the cuts of a 2x2x2 cube on the skewb would do this.
Each face would consist of 8 triangles.  Allowed twists would
be the 120 degree twist of the skewb and the 90 degree twist
of the 2x cube, only.  Stopping at 45 degrees or 60 degrees would
not allow a twist in a new direction to begin.  Any number
of 90 degree cube twists could follow any number of 120 degree
of skewb twists, followed by 90 degree twists, etc.

  My second idea/wish is a Dogic, but using 20 colors, rather than
12 colors.  Each face of 3 triangles (plus insert), would be
a unique color.  The main challenge I see in making this, is
choosing 20 easily distinguishable colors.  I like the 12 Dogic
color choices very much, because, to my eyes, they are easily
distinguishable, (in contrast to one of my skewbs that has 2
shades of orange for adjoining sides).

  2 ideas that I am currently building are an 8 color cube
and 12 color cube using Mefferts assembly cubes and tiles.
The 8 color is the corner centered design, and the 12 color
is an edge centered design.  These appeared in an early
Scientific American article.

  Does anyone in Cube-Lovers have a Web Page to collect ideas
of the group for future puzzle designs?

I'll add my two cents to this discussion, since I recently acquired some of
the new 4x4x4 units as well.  In short, both the Meffert and Oddzon reissues
are excellent.  The Oddzon initially turned the smoothest, but now my
Meffert's version is broken in and turns equally well.  Both cubes offer a
little give when the faces are not perfectly aligned.  They seem very
forgiving and you don't get the sense that you're going to break something
by playing with them.  In contrast to the old 1982 models (I have 3 or 4 of
the squeaky variety that broke easily), I'd say they're both great
improvements.

Regarding the stickers used, the Oddzon uses the blue opposite green color
scheme (yellow opposite white, orange opposite red).  The stickers on the
unit I received have not worn off like the Oddzon 3x3x3 stickers.  This
could be due to the fact that they are smaller, and less likely to be
scraped by a fingernail?  At any rate, the Meffert's 4x4x4 is clearly
superior since it uses the same six colors, but with the non-slip grooved
tiles.  His color combination places red opposite white and yellow opposite
orange, which works well.

I also got the other new Meffert cubes that feature the non-slip tiles,
including a Megaminx that has 12 unique colors (even the original had two
yellow faces on the top and bottom).  This is the best Megaminx ever!  It's
also nice having the Pyraminx, Skewb, and 5x5x5 in deluxe tile versions.
The cubic puzzles feature the same colors as his new 4x4x4 and the Pyraminx
receives red, blue, yellow, and green.

Finally, I'll mention a new puzzle called QUBLE by Geospace.  This is really
just a 3x3x3 with letters printed on the stickers.  Scrambling the letters
allows word games to be played with the cube, and there are six colors so
you can also solve it the traditional way.  Here is the URL:

The recent flurry of messages surround the revitalization of this list
finally prompted me to finish up (well, mostly...) something that's been
sitting around on my back burner for some time.

A few years back, I happened to pick up (for 10cents) a copy of the Rubik's
Race game at a local rummage sale.  Having never seen the game before, I
posted a description of the game to this list.

That posting --living on in the archives of this list-- seems to be just
about the only reference to the game on the 'net.  Consequently, every six
months or so I get a message from someone wanting more information about
the game or --more likely-- want to know where they can get a copy.

Anyway, I thought it might be useful to throw together a small "Rubik's
Race" webpage.  I still need to get to a scanner, so none of the promised
pictures are there (yet).  But the page contains a description of the game
and a Java Applet to allow the viewer to play a "solitaire" version of the
game.

That would be quite a challenge to create. Truth be told, I'm not even
sure if such a creation would be possible. However it is possible to make

This has also already been done. Hendrik Haak (www.puzzle-shop.de) is
currently selling the Dogic 2. If have yet to buy one myself, but it looks
like the colours should be easily distinguishable.

I don't know about the 8 colour cube, but I know for certain that the 12
colour version has already been made. I believ it's called "The Ultimate
Cube", and one was sold on eBay during the summer. L8r.

First of all, you need to be careful what you define as a move.
Cubists seem to fall approximately equally into one of two camps  --
those who count a 90 degree turn of one face as a move (a quarter
turn) and those who count either a 90 degree turn (a quarter turn) or
a 180 degree turn of one face (a half turn) as one move.

Quarter turns and half turns are collectively called face turns.  You
will sometimes see a solution described as an 18q solution (18
quarter turns) or as a 16f solution (16 face turns) or something like
that. The face turn terminology distinguishes between twists of
external (faces) and internal layers (slices).  A 3x3x3 can be solved
using only face moves.  A 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 etc. require both face and
slice moves.

Second, you need to distinguish between programs which calculate
optimal solutions vs. those which calculate suboptimal solutions.  I
am not aware of any programs which can calculate optimal solutions
for the 3x3x3 in seconds.  The best programs for optimal solutions
can require an hour or two or maybe a day or two to calculate an
optimal solution, depending on the speed of the machine, the memory
size of the machine, and the difficulty of the problem at hand.  This
may seem like a long time, but really it's an amazing achievement.

It is true that there are programs which can calculate *very good*
suboptimal solutions in just a few seconds.  The best example is
Herbert Kociemba's Cube Explorer 1.5.  It is downloadable from
Herbert's Web site (you can find it with any search engine) and from
the Cube-Lovers FTP site.  If you let it run long enough it will
eventually find an optimal solution, but "long enough" may be a great
deal longer than for programs designed specifically to find optimal
solutions.

The two amazing things to me about Cube Explorer 1.5 are that it is
so extremely fast, and that its suboptimal solutions are so darn near
optimal as quickly as they are.  In fact, it sometimes finds an
optimal solution in a matter of minutes, except that it is usually
not able to prove the that the solution is optimal anywhere near as
quickly as it is able to find the solution.  I will include only an
extremely brief description of its algorithm, and I will defer that
description until later in my note.

The best programs for finding optimal solutions use an IDA* algorithm
invented by Richard Korf.  IDA* was not invented specifically for
solving the cube, but it is well adapted to solving the cube.  Cube
Explorer 1.5 uses an IDA* algorithm in part.

I will assume that you understand breadth first and depth first
searches of a search space.  Your program for the 2x2x2 was
essentially doing a breadth first search  --  all one move sequences,
all two move sequences, all three move sequences, etc.

Depth first searches generally require much less memory than breadth
first. Only the positions from your current state to the goal state
have to be stored.  To do a depth first search of up to nine moves,
you never have to store more than nine states (well, really ten, the
original one plus nine more).  However, depth first searches can kind
of run away with you and can run practically forever.

The first piece of IDA* to deal with this bad aspect of depth first
searches is called Iterative Deepening depth first (the ID of IDA*).
You do a depth first search that is first bound at one move, then
bound at two moves, then bound at three moves, etc.  The procedure
can seem sort of breadth first instead of depth search, but the
underlying search really is depth first.  You just bound the search
and gradually increase the bound.

Iterative Deepening depth first is still too slow for the cube.  Here
is where the A* bit comes in.  Suppose you were going to do an
Iterative Deepening search one move deep, then two moves, then three
moves, etc., but suppose you also knew for sure by some magic that
the solution is at least twelve moves.  Then, there is no point in
doing the one move or two move or eleven move search.  You might as
well start by bounding you Iterative Deepening search at twelve, then
going on to thirteen, fourteen, etc.

What is this "magic" by which you might know that the solution is at
least twelve moves?  Korf calls it a pattern data base.  I just call
it a table.  All it amounts to is that you create a table of
positions that are a subset of the entire cube  --  say the corners
only.  For each one of those positions, you calculate how many moves
there are in the minimal solution.  Then you take your position and
look it up in the table.  For example, for the 3x3x3 you ignore the
edges and look up the corners in the table.  If it will require
twelve moves to solve the corners, based on your table, then it will
require at least twelve moves to solve the whole cube.  So you start
your Iterative Deepening search at twelve moves because you know that
anything less is going to fail.

But then you go one step further and look in your table after every
move.  For example, you determine that your initial position is at
least twelve moves from Start, so you commence an Iterative Deepening
search which is bounded at twelve moves.  You make your first move.
If the corners are now eleven moves from Start, you let the search
continue.  But if the corners are now twelve or thirteen moves from
Start, it will be impossible to find a twelve move solution so you
cut off that branch of the search and backtrack (you have already
made one move, so twelve or thirteen more yield a total of thirteen
or fourteen which is greater than your bound of twelve).

The best IDA* programs run on a fast processor with lots of memory to
hold a very large table, and a table which is very cleverly
constructed.

Finishing my note by talking about Cube Explorer 1.5 again, it is a
two phase algorithm which finds one position intermediate between the
current state and the goal state.  It breaks the problem down into
two substeps because it takes so long to solve the problem all in one
go. But because there is an intermediate step, the solution is not
necessarily optimal.  It uses IDA* to get from the initial position
to the intermediate position.  After a suboptimal solution is found,
it looks for better solutions by making the intermediate position
further from the initial step.  If it is ever able to solve a
position all in the first substep, then that solution is proven
optimal.

I agree that the archives are becoming unmanageable simply because
there are so many of them.  I don't know what the solution is.  I
would still urge you to read as much of the archives as possible.
For this particular subject, look for Kociemba, Cube Explorer, Korf,
and IDA*.  Also, look up the discussion of mike reid's optimal
solver, and the very clever table he creates.

My sense of it is that - like most lists - cube-lovers consists of a
few relatively prolific posters and a whole lotta lurkers.  But only

Heh.  Yeah, that's a danger.  I managed most of it myself, though it
took a while; the one piece someone had to show me is a double edge
flip.

If you don't mind something really permanent, you can always take the
stickers off and paint the facicles.  I've done this on a 3-Cube and
have a 5-Cube sitting disassembled waiting for the same treatment.

The 2-Cube *has* been completely solved; back in 1992 I wrote a program
that did so, and I'm sure dozens of others have done likewise, before
and since.  Here are position counts:

For the quarter-turn metric:
              1 at distance  0 [Wed May 13 23:18:51 1992]
              6 at distance  1 [Wed May 13 23:18:52 1992]
             27 at distance  2 [Wed May 13 23:18:53 1992]
            120 at distance  3 [Wed May 13 23:18:54 1992]
            534 at distance  4 [Wed May 13 23:18:55 1992]
           2256 at distance  5 [Wed May 13 23:18:56 1992]
           8969 at distance  6 [Wed May 13 23:18:58 1992]
          33058 at distance  7 [Wed May 13 23:19:06 1992]
         114149 at distance  8 [Wed May 13 23:19:29 1992]
         360508 at distance  9 [Wed May 13 23:20:53 1992]
         930588 at distance 10 [Wed May 13 23:24:52 1992]
        1350852 at distance 11 [Wed May 13 23:35:53 1992]
         782536 at distance 12 [Wed May 13 23:53:44 1992]
          90280 at distance 13 [Thu May 14 00:03:19 1992]
            276 at distance 14 [Thu May 14 00:04:25 1992]

For the half-turn metric:
              1 at distance  0 [Thu May 14 00:12:37 1992]
              9 at distance  1 [Thu May 14 00:12:39 1992]
             54 at distance  2 [Thu May 14 00:12:41 1992]
            321 at distance  3 [Thu May 14 00:12:42 1992]
           1847 at distance  4 [Thu May 14 00:12:44 1992]
           9992 at distance  5 [Thu May 14 00:12:56 1992]
          50136 at distance  6 [Thu May 14 00:13:08 1992]
         227536 at distance  7 [Thu May 14 00:14:26 1992]
         870072 at distance  8 [Thu May 14 00:20:43 1992]
        1887748 at distance  9 [Thu May 14 00:47:06 1992]
         623800 at distance 10 [Thu May 14 01:46:46 1992]
           2644 at distance 11 [Thu May 14 02:07:51 1992]

I don't recall why the half-turn run was so much slower; perhaps
something else (backups?) started running at midnight....

> [T]here are computer programs which can solve the 3x3x3 in seconds

There are - but not if you also demand that the result be certain to be
an optimal solution.  Heck, a program could be written that just cranks
through a recipe such as you can find in any of dozens of books; such a
program could run in less than a second on all but the tiniest of
computers.  The interest lies in finding *good* - or otherwise
interesting - solutions.

The latter, certainly.  The former, well, perhaps; I haven't seen the
code, so it's hard to say. :-)  Certainly your choice of language will
work against producing a high-speed program.
