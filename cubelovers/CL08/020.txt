Subject: Re:  Hungarian Rings solution?

You don't nood commutators for it, cycles are sufficient (because there
are so many similar colored beads).  If I remember right one useful move
is:  turn right ring clockwise two beads, turn left clockwise two beads,
turn right anti-clockwise two beads, turn left anti-clockwise two beads.
Using them properly will solve the rings.
