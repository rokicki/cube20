i mentioned these because i was particularly proud of them, especially
since they were constructed by hand.  my program was able to improve
"stripes", but i reoriented the pattern first.  perhaps this is why
i had better success.  stripes (17 face / 20 quarter):
R1 U1 D1 R2 F1 U3 D1 F3 B1 U3 R3 L3 B1 L2 U1 D3 B2  (14 + 3)
so if you have any efficient pattern maneuvers that you're especially
proud of, let's see if they can't be improved.

this can also be done in 18 quarter turns:
L1 F1 L1 D3 B1 D1 L2 F2 D3 F3 R1 U3 R3 F2 D1  (13 + 2)
also "cube within cube within cube"  17 face / 22 quarter turns:
L3 D1 R3 B3 D1 L2 D2 L3 D3 L1 U1 D2 R3 U3 B2 R2 D3  (13 + 4)
"twisted rings"  16 face / 18 quarter turns:
B1 R1 B3 R2 U3 F3 L1 U1 R1 D1 L1 U3 B3 L1 U1 L2  (14 + 2)
"twisted cube edges"  14 face / 14 quarter turns:
D1 L3 B1 R1 D3 R3 D1 B3 L1 B1 R3 B3 R1 D3  (13 + 1)

'tis a shame.  the english edition is very good.  i've never seen the
german.  in the english edition he gives several "open snakes".
here's what my program has to say about them.
"rattlesnake"  14 face / 18 quarter turns:
F3 D3 L1 D3 L2 F1 B2 U1 L3 U3 R3 B2 R1 L2  (13 + 1)
"black mamba"  14 face / 14 quarter turns:
L1 U1 R1 F3 R3 L1 U1 L3 U3 D1 B1 D3 L3 U3  (13 + 1)
"green mamba"  13 face / 14 quarter turns:
R3 L2 F1 R1 U1 L3 F3 B1 U1 B3 U3 L3 U3  (12 + 1)
"boa"  12 face / 16 quarter turns:
D1 R1 F3 R1 L1 F2 R2 D3 L2 F2 L1 F3  (12 + 0)

this last one was very nice, since it was completely solved in stage 1!

> Also done, I do not look for ties.

i am currently looking for ties, but will soon stop.  this is mainly to
catch (by eye) maneuvers that are short quarter turn-wise.  i realize
this is stupid for at least two reasons:  1: the program may well be
passing up sequences which are shorter in quarter turns;  2: a slightly
different version of the program will specifically look for the shortest
sequence in quarter turns.  i'm trying to think of the best way to do this.
unfortunately, the temptation is NOT to think, but to feed every
imaginable pattern into the program.  :-)

still need to do some polishing ...
