in his "cubic circular," issue(s) 5/6 (pages 26, 27) he gives some info
about this, although it is (at least) third hand information, and therefore
not necessarily reliable.

he gives the same figures, so they are probably correct.

he does not give these, but he does mention that the diameter is 14.

singmaster says that the calculation took "over 51 hours of computer time"!
ouch!  this was 10 years ago, though.  (what's 51 hours / 3 minutes ?)

the "unix news item" from which singmaster apparently got his info was
included in a cube-lovers message.  it's in the archives, cube-mail-3,
sept 15, 1981 in a message from "ISAACS at SRI-KL".

dik's results show that the corners of the 3x3x3 can be "solved" (i.e.
positioned correctly with respect to one another) in 11 face (respectively
14 quarter) turns.  it would be nice to know if they can be solved with
respect to the centers within 11 face (respectively 14 quarter) turns.
this seems likely.
