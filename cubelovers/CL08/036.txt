I haven't tried the Triamid or Tangle, but I bought the Fifteen and the Dice.
I'm still thinking of attacking the Fifteen, but I really hate the Dice after
I twice had gotten four of the faces in their right places, knocked the thing
a bit too much, which caused the plates to fall to the bottom. I hate that 
**** thing and won't touch it again for a long time!
