What's UP

-  GAMES magazine is sponsoring 
  "WORLD PUZZLE TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS" 
   in NYC June 24-28;  registration forms in 
   April issue of GAMES, on newsstands march 1


-  NEW PUZZLE
It is called "PYRIX" (retails for $10, 
   I do not have a retail source) and is from: 
   Enpros Novelty Products, Lorentzstraat 2, 
   2912 AH Niewerkerk aan den IJssel,
   The Netherlands -  
   tel 31 (0)1803-19133

DESCRIPTION:  The puzzle is an assembly folding
  puzzle based on a size 3 tetrahedron.  The 
  tetrahedron is dissected into 3 regular octahedrons
  and 11 tetrahedrons (1/3 the size of the original).
  These pieces are strung on a thread like a necklace;
  an octahedron, 3 tetras, an octahedron, etc except
  for one position that has only 2 tetras.  The octahedrons
  are threaded on the diagonal of their square cross section.
OBJECT:  The faces are colored and the object is to not 
  only assemble a tetra but of course to do it with solid
  colored faces,  the enclosure says that there are 
  2 solutions as they have colored and strung the pieces.
PRELIMINARY REVIEW:  It took about 1 hour.  The puzzle 
  is awkward to manipulate since it falls apart easily.
  Doing it on a flat surface and using tape to hold it
  together seems to be the trick.
