here's a shorter way.  in the "flubrd" notation, use:

              D' F^2 R U^2 F^2 B^2 D^2 R^2 L' F^2 U' D^2

which is 11 "HST" (which i call "slice turns").  this is also 12
"face" turns, but 20 quarter turns.  this can also be done in only 14
quarter turns as follows:
                            F^2 U D F B U D F B U D F B'     (*)

note that this can easily be obtained from the well-known manuever for
"laughter":
                              ( F B  C_U )^6                (**)

where  C_  means "turn the whole cube" (as in Bandelow's book).  note
that this manuever reorients the cube.  then manuever (*) is just the
"flubrd" translation of the manuever  M_F (**) M_F'  (without the cube
reorientation), where  M_  means "turn the middle slice," again, as in
Bandelow's book.

here's a question for those out there with 5x5x5 cubes: have you
noticed that the stickers seem to be more happy on the floor than on
the facelets of the cube?  the more i use my cube, the more restless
they seem to become.  does anyone know of a good cure for this?  i'm
thinking of taking them all off, cleaning off the glue (or gum or
whatnot) and gluing them back on, using a stronger glue.  anyone have
any suggestions for what kind of glue?  i'll let you know how my
experiment works.
