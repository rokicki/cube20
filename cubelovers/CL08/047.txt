In addition to being self-contradicting (and misspelled), the above seems
to have nothing to do with the subject of Rubik's Tangle.

Lest this message suffer the same flaw, I'll add that I too was unable to
come up with any mathematical or intuitive method for solving the Tangle.
I solved mine by computer.  (I've always been fairly good at finding ways
to prune a bushy search tree down to manageable size.)  I have Tangle #1
and can confirm it has exactly two solutions (ignoring overall rotations
of the 5x5 array, of course).

I haven't had a chance to examine closely the other Tangles.  How do they
differ from #1?  Do they use a different pattern of connectivity on the
tiles?  Do they have a different mix of the permutations?  (#1 has each
4-color permutation exactly once, except for one permutation which appears
twice.)  I hope they do not simply permute the colors relative to #1; that
would be dull since they would then be identical puzzles, and collecting
more than one would be silly except for the purpose of building the 10x10
combined puzzle.
