He does not say how many, but his article gives nine patterns that have been
published earlier in CFF for which he finds shorter answers.  Also more are
promised for future issues.

I can give some information.  What he does do is calculate in advance through
the three axis of his space the minimal number of moves needed to get at
[0,0,0].  This is used for tree pruning.  It obviously will not prune
everything (e.g. if you are at point [x,y,z] it may very well be that [x,?,?]
for other points requires less moves, and similar across the y and z
direction), but he tells that his pruning is very effective.  I do not know
how he prunes in the second case, because he does not completely describes
the coordinates of his second space, but I presume pruning is done in a
similar way.

I think so too.  Moreover, it is difficult to take in account what he
found, namely that a minimal solution in the first stage does not guarantee
a minimal overall solution.

Well, apparently Thistlethwaite did not know that those were the diameters,
otherwise I have no explanation for the question marks as they appear in
Singmaster.

I will try to contact him to see what he has to say about those.
