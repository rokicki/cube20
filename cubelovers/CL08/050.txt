The duplicate piece in each tangle is:
                1       2       3       4
Tangle 1        Blue    Red     Yellow  Green
Tangle 2        Yellow  Blue    Green   Red
Tangle 3        Green   Yellow  Blue    Red
Tangle 4        Red     Green   Yellow  Blue

All 4 Tangles are the same puzzle, just colored differently.
Each has all 24 color permutations, plus a duplicate.

Each Tile also has a letter (A-Y) on the back, and a reference to the
Tangle that it occurs in.  These letters appear to be for reference
only.  I have found no corresponddence between the letterings in one
puzzle, and the letterings in another.  I just use them as a convenience
for recording configurations, and sorting through the tiles.
