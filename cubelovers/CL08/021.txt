I got given one of these things for Christmas (well, actually I gave it
to myself). I was wondering if anyone has any good basic operators that
they would like to share.  I would imagine that the puzzle must be less
complex than a true cube,  but the restricted set of moves make solving
it more complicated than you might think!
[I currently have six corners correct, but I still have two (diagonally
opposite) corners interchanged.  The cube-solving technique that I used
for a real cube doesn't work here - I need something different].
