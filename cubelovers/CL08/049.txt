I would love to hear an insight that makes this puzzle tractible in real
time (hours rather than days) by hand.  Here's a brief description of
Tangle #1; as I said in my earlier posting, I don't know how the other 3
differ, though I'm pretty sure they each have the same number of tiles.

Tangle #1 consists of 25 square tiles, each of which has four colored
ropes crossing it in the following pattern.  (Note: This may be mirror
imaged, since I'm working from memory.)

	---------------------
	|     @       #     |
	|     @       #     |
	|$$    @      # %%%%|
	|  $    @    %#%    |
	|   $    @ %% #     |
	|    $    %@  #     |
	|    $  %%  @@#     |
	|    %%%      #@@   |
	|%%%% $       #  @@@|
	|     $       #     |
	|     $       #     |
	---------------------

The connection marked with $ actually wanders around the tile a bit more,
but the connectivity is as shown.  The object is to place the tiles in a
5x5 array such that wherever two tiles touch the colors of the ropes match.
In Tangle #1 each permutation of colors occurs once, with one permutation
occurring twice.

The box says that if you get all four Tangles, you can put them together
to make a 10x10 array under the same color-matching constraints.
