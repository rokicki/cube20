Regarding the meta-approach of descending through a series of subgroups,
how much leverage does properly selecting the chain give you?  It seems
like the jump from <F2,B2,...> to <F2,B2,L2,R2,...> is pretty large.
There are probably other paths through the subgroup lattice.

Does anyone have a table of subgroups?
