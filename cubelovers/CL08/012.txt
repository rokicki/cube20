The world of MECHANICAL PUZZLE collecting is getting organized. 
 Jerry Slocum is compiling a directory of collectors, also designers,
buyers, sellers.  If you want to be included there is a form to fill
out (hardcopy).  The form has to be to Jerry by 1/15/92 to be
included.  This is a non-commercial venture and I am unaware of any
extended plans.

To get a form contact Jerry:
  JERRY SLOCUM
  257 SOUTH PALM DRIVE
  BEVERLY HILLS, CA 90212 USA
  PHONE & FAX  310/273-2270

I assume form can be FAXed.  I have copies so if need be I can mail
you one.

PS:  There is classification for computer puzzles but not one for
computer solutions/helper programs, eg, cube simulations & non
physically realizable cubes, like 10x10x10.
