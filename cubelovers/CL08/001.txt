I follow up in cube-lovers.

Actually the 7x7x7 is also the first cube that can not be made.

But, all of E to J can be solved with the same set of procedures %.  So
although there appear to be 7 essentially different cubelets, actually
there are only 5.  And the 5x5x5 cube has them all.  Solving these involves
rotating the three slices they are in originally.  So if we rename cubelet
types we get:
1:  A
2:  B&C
3:  D
4:  E-J
5:  K
and we find for the different cubes:
2x2x2:	Type 1
3x3x3:	Type 1, 3 and 5
4x4x4:	Type 1, 2 and 4
5x5x5:	All types.
--
%  All of E to J occur 4 times on each face, so for each type there are 24
   cubelets.  B and C also occur 24 times, procedures working for these
   two also work for E to J (although I use different procedures both on
   4x4x4 and 5x5x5); but there are procedures for E to J that do not work
   for B to C (these two have more constraints on position).  This would be
   different if the cube was patterned such that all cubelets of type B, C
   and E to J had a unique position, in that case we would have only four
   essentially different types.
