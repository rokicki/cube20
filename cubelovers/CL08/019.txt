Subject:  Hungarian Rings solution?

Does anyone have an algorithm for solving the "Hungarian Rings" they'd
be willing to share.  I found one in a drawer that had been long
misplaced, and I've been fiddling with it some.  It seems easy enough
to find lots of 'commutators' for the thing, but all the ones I've run
into have the annoying property that they produce symmetric
perumtations [given a 180 degree rotation of the puzzle].  But of
course, my puzzle is no where near symmetrically messed up.

Any advice, hints, full-blown algorithm, etc, would be appreciated... Thanks!

ps, For those that don't remember it, the "Hungarian Rings" is a puzzle with
beads arranged in two intersecting circles:

	*       *
      *   *   *   *
    *       *       *
  *       *   *       *
 *       *     *       *
  *       *   *       *
    *       *       *
      *   *   *   *
	*       *

[Imagine these both round...:-)]  and you can slide the beads around either
cicle.    The beads come in four colors andthe object is to get the colors
all sorted out.  /b\
