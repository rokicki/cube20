Well, I'm glad that my silly ideas triggered something.  Sometimes I
wonder if they are as amusing to read as they were to write.

Certainly a dovetail would do it.  I guess when I got to sharpening
the fresnel saw I didn't know when to quit.

Surprisingly enough, this is just how Rubik's Revenge is put together.
One of the center cubelets (perhaps always on the blue side) has a
screw that joins the outside of the cubelet to its dovetail.  You can
usually find locate it by the dimple in the colored sticker.

In the 7^3 and larger, they have to go through the surface, and even
if they were squared-off dovetails they wouldn't match the color of
the adjacent square except in the solved position.  Unless of
course we make the outer layers thicker, as Dale Newfield mentioned
when we were discussing this back in May.

Wow, I want one!  But I don't think the material really needs to be
transparent, as long as the face center pieces are hollow.  It would
help let light in, though.
