Subject: Re: Rubik's Cube, the minimax number of moves



I wonder how large the necessary tables for Thistlethwaite's method for the
cube are? I seem to recall reading that there were a few hundred entries, but
is this anywhere near? And, more important, have they been published, or does
anyone have them in an electronic format?

	Thanks,
