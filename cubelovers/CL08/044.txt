well, it's been kicking around in both rec.puzzles and sci.math lately.
maybe you should ask if anyone has heard any follow-up to the above.
i've sent away to the dutch cubists' club for membership and info,
but they want payments in the form of international money orders
(which probably means a good month or two delay).
if/when i have some more info on this, i'll gladly share it with
cube-lovers.
