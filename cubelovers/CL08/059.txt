Subject: Diameter of the 2^3 cube and the 3^3 corners

I sent the results of a quarter-turn analysis of these puzzles to
Cube-Lovers in several messages during August, 1984.  I modified a
program written by Karl Dahlke to get these results.  I counted both
positions and local maxima at every distance up to the diameter of 14
quarter-turns.  In case you don't have the archives handy, here are
the results:

The first column agrees with Dik Winter's findings.  As Michael Reid
surmised, the diameters of the two groups are the same.

My hazy recollection is that the 2^3 program ran for a few minutes on
a Vax 750, while the corners program took a couple of hours.
