I have already been chastised that what I described are commutators.  Of course
they are.  Not only is my thinking bad late at night, but apparently my
spelling is atrocious :-).

True.  But if you prefix the move by a (series of moves) that makes the upper
three of an identical color (and postfix by its inverse), you will not see
the difference between a true cycle.  At least that is how I always did the
final part.  (Correctly coloring the two lobes is in fact easy; you better
start with that.)
