Subject: Re: Rubik's cube dice tops (Spoiler)

Last week ronnie@cisco.com (Ronnie Kon) challenged us to find Rubik's
cube patterns with dice pips for 1, 2, and 3 on the three pairs of
opposite sides.  He claimed it could be done in fourteen HST, where
one HST is a turn of a face or center slice by 90 or 180 degrees.  I
responded that it could be done in thirteen HST.  Here is how.  I will
use this opportunity to practice the enhanced Varga Rubiksong I
described (unfortunately with many typos) on 22 Feb 90.

The (only such) pattern is the composition of Four-Spot and Laughter.
We have long known the processes

          ris-fos tis-fos, or (RL)^2 FB' (TD)^2 FB', for Four-Spot and
  fon-ron fon-ron fon-ron, or (FBRL)^3,              for Laughter.

When we compose them, the F and B moves combine and cancel to produce

ris-fos tis-fi ron-fon ron-fon ron, or (RL)^2 FB' (TD)^2 F^2 (RLFB)^2 RL.

This 14 HST process is presumably something like what Ronnie had in
mind.  But since this pattern commutes with ris, or (RL)^2, we can get
the same pattern with the conjugate process

    fos tis-fi ron-fon ron-fon ran, or FB' (TD)^2 F^2 (RLFB)^2 R'L'.

This uses only 13 HST.  This is also the shortest process I know of in
the normal metric: 18 QT, which is not so bad for the combination of
two 12 QT processes.

I suggested that perhaps 12 HST would be sufficient, but I have not
found such an improvement.  Nor do I know whether 13 HST is the best
that can be done: it seems that proving 13 HST optimal would require
examining about 160 million positions, almost as many as the 200
million it would take to prove 18 QT optimal.
