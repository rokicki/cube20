Subject: Kociemba's algorithm

I did some more and found fast algorithms.  The most amazing one was for
the configuration with two 2x2x2 cubes embedded in the cube:
	( 9+ 6=15): U1 L2 D1 R1 B3 R1 B3 R1 B3 D3 L2 U1 R2 F2 U2
This looks remarkably like a random sequence of moves.  I find especially
the part R1 B3 R1 B3 R1 B3 intriguing!

(For der Mouse.  I lost your e-mail address.  I can provide you with the
program.  And for everybody, it is available, although I still do not like
the input method.)
