well, at least i had the record for a couple of days!  ;-)

but i don't understand how we can get 74 positions at distance 2 from
only 4 positions at distance 1.  the 4 positions at distance 1 are
easy to see: they're the positions obtained from START by the turns
B, F, L  and  R.  with only 18 different face turns, each should
extend to at most 18 positions at distance 2.  am i missing something
obvious here?  (the numbers do seem to add up, though.)

the pattern (written in permutation notation)  (FR, FL) (UFL, DFR) is
at distance 15, so that's (also) a lower bound.  however, if the whole
cube is turned so that the  F  face becomes the  U face, then the new
pattern is still in the subgroup of stage 2, but is now at distance 14.
