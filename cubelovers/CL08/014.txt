Hmm.  A likely story.

We are challenged to find ``tops'',

Where he counts a half turn, a slice, and and a half-slices as one
move each.  I have found how this can be done in 13 such moves.  I
have some suspicion that it can be done in 12; I'll let you know.

We are then challenged to convert this

The second part can be solved by any person who achieves mastery of
the cube.
