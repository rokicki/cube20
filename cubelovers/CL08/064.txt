Subject: My program is too fast ;-).

I have posted a bit on my version of Kociemba's program, and I can only
conclude that my program is too fast.  After doing the superfliptwist,
the superflip and the supertwist I thought about trying those configurations
where Singmaster's notes did not give a solution better than 21 moves.
I find now that it takes more time to enter the configurations than what
the program needs to solve it!  Upto now I found the following (I will not
give the exact moves, as I think Kociemba wants to publish a bit more about
this):
superflip:	20 moves
supertwist:	16 moves
superfliptwist:	20 moves
Walker's 6+:	17 moves (was 22)
Walker's 6X:	19 moves (was 25)
Walker's worm:	14 moves (was 23)

Initialization time for the program is 2.5 minutes.  But it finds solutions
after only a few seconds!  If you have a configuration that you think is at
a large distance from start, mail it and I will disprove it ;-).
