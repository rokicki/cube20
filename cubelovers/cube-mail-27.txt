I can't see how.  Based on how I saw my cube move as I did this, I
don't believe it's putting significant stress on any of the face-center
cubies.  Remember, what I said to do was to push the wing cubie away
from the corner cubie, not vice versa; the only face cubie anywhere
near the operation is the one you're prying towards, and the wing cubie
is pivoting around that, not prying past it.

After disassembling my cube, I remembered this advice, and tried to get
one of the face centers off.  Even with the cube disassembled, I
desisted for fear of breaking the plastic rather than the glue join.

Perhaps there are multiple production runs in existence and some of
them come apart more easily this way than others?

I have a Rubik's Magic Strategy Game that consists of the playing board,
16 playpieces and instructions.  Unfortunately we have lost the
instructions and our son, who's game it is no longer lives at home and
can't remember how it was played.

Would you have or know where I might obtain a copy of these
instructions. The game is of no use to us with out them.  The game was
distributed by Matchbox toys in 1987.

Any help you can lend would be greatly appreciated.

Or corner Andrew Plotkin and get him to let you try out "The Liquid

quite a challenge.

I always had problems solving the cube in bars.  I would always have a
"friend" that would want to drag me into a bar and make money off of my
cube solving skills, but the lighting was always low and I couldn't tell
the colors apart.

Along those lines, I have a brass cube.  Easy to solve, or nearly
impossible?  It is heavy, even though I believe it is only "plated".

I have a picture of it on my web site at:
http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Sideline/2953/

I also have a "cubo 15" cube you all may find interesting.

Thanks!

Here in the northeastern US, high-pressure sodium (Na) vapor lamps are
common; they have a much broader spectrum that the essentially
monochromatic low-pressure lamps. The latter are rather strange! They're
also more efficient, I'm fairly sure. I haven't looked at a cube under
the h.p. lamps, though.

The simplest thing you can do is to go to your local store and buy a 
copy of "Rubik's Eclipse".  The rules are identical.

I may have a copy of the original game lying around if this is unsucessful.

Hi all,

I've been having some marathon cubing sessions lately, and sometimes my
wrists, fingers, or forearms would hurt.  It's really hard to stop
because I'm so addicted, but I have to because I'm scared I might get
carpal tunnel syndrome or some sort of repetitive stress problem.  I
love computers, and since I'm studying computer science, and because
I'll have many many hours on a keyboard ahead of me, this scares me even
more.  Does anyone else have have this problem?  Any advice?  Thanks.

Hello, Wayne and other speed cubists,
    if you see about 15 year backwards you would realize that a few
speed cubists have their average time below 20 sec and quite a lot of others
below 25 sec.
But you are interested in CURRENT Best Time and Average Time, I see.
After a few weeks of practicing my times are:
18 sec, 24 sec, (not bad after some years of 'abstinence' :-))
My method is Jiri's.
Beside that, I practice in solving the cube in minimum moves (face moves)
for which I use slightly different method for first two layers:
2x2 subcube first, 2x2x3 next, 2x3x3 - two layers and for the last layer
I may or may not use some more moves than Jiri's method uses.
My average number of moves is about 48 within 2 min restriction.

Subject: Inventing your own techniques


I've been reading Cube-Lovers e-mail for a few months now and am
enjoying it very much.  It is one of the great benefits of the
Internet that people with a common interest, but spread so far apart,
can so easily communicate like this.

For me, the most fun, and the ultimate challenge, in cubing comes from
figuring out how to solve the puzzle in the first place.  I avoid
published and posted techniques.  I'd really like to hear from people
on this list on how you go about inventing new moves and techniques or
how you feel about learning to solve a puzzle on your own.

I vaguely remember how I learned to solve the 3x3x3 back in the early
80's.  I was in 8th grade at the time; now I'm in 25th grade.
According to my family I quite thoroughly infatuated by the puzzle at
the time.  Solving one side was faily easy and then I was able to get
2 and 3 sides, but with a disorganized and perhaps even random method.

I heard from a friend (who had a solution book) that the key to
solving the top and bottom was a set of special moves that allowed you
to manipulate the bottom corner pieces without affecting the top side.
I set out to find these moves on my own and did.  I would carefully
record the position and orientation of each corner piece, then move a
top corner out of position and then back into position in a different
way and check how the bottom side changed.  This led to a few
sequences which I could repeatedly apply to solve the bottom corners.

The rest was fairly easy, except for the situation in which two edges
were flipped.  I had to have someone show me a move to get past this
point.  I couldn't figure it out.  Otherwise, I had a 50% chance of
solving on any given attempt.

Now I have a 4x4x4 and a 5x5x5 cube as well.  I've been able to solve
these primarily using extensions of the techniques I learned for the
3x3x3 and a few new extras, but only to a point.  I'm now stuck if one
pair of "wing" pieces are switched.  If two pairs are switched, I can
solve it, but not if only one are switched.  Again, I solve it 50% of
the times I set out.

Of course, there was at least on posted solution for this very problem
to this list a couple of weeks ago.  I saved it to a folder just in
case I decide to resort to it, but in the mean time want to figure
this out on my own.

Regards,
Fred Wheeler

As a programmer, I am no stranger to repetitive stress related aches and
pains.  I even had cubist's thumb way back :)  My simulator, puzzler, has
mainly a mouse interface and this given enough time can cause you to be
rather sore as well.  I was wondering if anyone had an idea for a "hands on
keyboard" approach that would allow you to naturally move the puzzles'
slices.

There is a macro interface for the cubes to enter moves in UDFBLR notation,
but I am thinking of something that you could, with practice, manipulate a
cube in realtime using a keyboard.

Any ideas would be appreciated and I'll try my best to implement the best
one.  If simulators "felt" like a cube when you used them they would be more
fun (and move without jamming etc)

	Beryl Fletcher, who organized my first cube at the International
Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki in 1978, also developed Cubist's Thumb.
The early cubes were stiff and one held them with a corner pressing on the
tendon of the left thumbb, in the fleshy part of the thumb.  With olde people,
the tendon sheath, or rather the inner lubricant, has become a bit aged and the
constant pressure leads to a chronic inflammation.  This is readily treated by
a small operation which cuts open the tendon sheath.  Both Dame Kathleen
Ollerneshaw and Beryl Fletcher had this.
	When I was working on my Notes, I did a lot of checking of move
sequences and typing and got definite pains in the wrist.  Since then, word
processing has also occasionally produced RSI problems.  Fortunately, rest lets

After I understood conjugation well enough, I have never invented a
move that I can in all honesty call "new" -- although they may appear
"new" to others.  The only new part is just applying it to different
types of moves and seeing what the result is.

I had some ideas on this once. The first keyboard layout below is easier
to learn but the second would be faster once you had mastered it.

[QWERTY keyboard]

1)

U = r
U'= u
D'= f
D = j

R = 7
R'= m
L'= 4
L = v

F = h
F'= g
B'= y
B = t

2)

Any mappings using this set of keys:

  er  ui
asdf  jkl;

The simulator input key should be configurable so you can try out these
variations once its written. If you want help implementing it, feel free
to ask me - just in case I ever have some free time on my hands!

  Oddly enough, I have been thinking about a method to manipulate a
cube by use of the numeric keypad.  It seems most moves can be
completed rather naturally, but I do not know if it works in practice.

  Anyways, take a keypad like this:

7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3

  This corresponds to a face of a cube quite nicely.  Suppose you
wanted to rotate the right face clockwise.  One could enter 36 or 69,
for example, which you could conceptually think of as the direction
your hand would move to rotate the right face clockwise.  Counter
clockwise would be the other direction.  (96 or 63 or even 93) The
same technique could be applied to the left face or top face or bottom
face.  The middle slices could be rotated just as easil: 52 would rotate
the middle vertical slice down.

  The question is how to effect rotating the front and rear faces.
For me, 19 and 91 seem natural for F and F' because they basically
mimic the twisting motion.  The rear is more troublesome, but perhaps
for symetry 73 and 37 might be used?

  Anyways, that could take care the turns, Cube rotations could be as
simple as a shift followed by a direction.  shift-5-2 might rotate the
cube along the X axis such that U is now F and F is now D, etc...

  I do not know if keypad entry is any more or less prone to these
types of entry, but I think that the general mechanism might work.

Hello-

We talked in the past about Oddzon (Current distributor of Rubik's Products
for Seven Towns - the holder of the Rubik's brand) and the version of the
Rubik's Cube on the market.  If you are tired of those stickers that fall
apart and would like a well built cube...one that has a sprung indexing
mechanism which would mean that a layer would gently "click" into place
when aligned along with tiles instead of stickers, then it's time for you
to place your vote and influence them.  They are currently looking into
making a "Deluxe" Rubik's Cube, but, need to see if the market will support
such a product.  Anyway, you can place your vote at the following link:

I fought with this issue back in about 1985 when I was originally working on
the 2x2x2 and the corners of the 3x3x3.  I created a data base for each, with a
program which would allow you to manipulate the cube on the screen, and the
program would always show you your exact distance from Start.  Actually, the
screen would show you two renderings of the cube  --  one was the cube you were
manipulating and the other was the representative of the same cube under
reduction by symmetry.  It was the representative that was looked up in the
data base.

I tried all kinds of input mappings, none of which were very satisfying.  One
obvious thing to try is U for Up, D for Down, etc., but on a QWERTY keyboard
this is not very easy to deal with.

Keyboards in 1985 only had a numeric pad, not the additional arrow and page
up/down keys of modern keyboards.  Within the numeric pad, I ended up using up
arrow for U, down arrow for D, right arrow for R, and left arrow for L.  That
left the question of F and B.  It *sounds* kind of dumb, but using the
numeric pad + key for B and the numeric pad 0/INS key for F worked about as
well as anything.  With these mappings, I could manipulate the cube without
looking at the keyboard and with very little movement of my hand.

I used the shift keys for things like U' and U2.  So left shift plus up arrow
was U' and right shift plus up arrow was U2, etc.  I read the shift keys
directly from the keyboard hardware (this was early DOS, and you could do such
things).  I wouldn't necessarily recommend accessing the hardware so directly
these days.  However, I found that I almost never used the shift keys.  Rather,
I would tap the up arrow key quickly three times for U', and I would tap the up
arrow key quickly two times for U2.

I did not implement an interface for whole cube moves.  Rather, to rotate the
whole cube I would do something like RL' or R'L or UD' etc.  Well, this
works for the 2x2x2, but not for the corners of the 3x3x3.

It's tricky to make the interface simple and intuitive, and also to make it
functionally rich at the same time.

i already sent this to noel directly, but since others are sending
suggestions here i thought i'd toss in my thoughts about a keyboard cube
interface...

this is a wonderful user interface design challenge.  i've thought about it
before, because i have never been comfortable with any of the mouse-based
interfaces for moving 3d objects around.  i've never used one that seemed
fully intuitive to me.

i'd love to see an interface like this:

* 5 faces of the cube visible at once (all except B), perhaps something
like this (except square, and with the individual cubies showing of course):

      +------------------+
      |\                /|
      | \      U       / |
      |  \            /  |
      |   +----------+   |
      |   |          |   |
      | L |    F     | R |
      |   |          |   |
      |   |          |   |
      |   +----------+   |
      |  /            \  |
      | /      D       \ |
      |/                \|
      +------------------+

* unshifted keys for turning each of the visible faces either CW or CCW, a
total of 10 keys in all, and repeated on the left- and right-hand side of
the keyboard.  the following diagram shows the cube operations thus
associated with various keys (though the diagram is laid out mostly like
the keyboard, i've added space between the hands for clarity):

     w:L'  e:U'  r:U   t:R         y:L'  u:U'  i:U   o:R

       s:F'        f:F                     j:F'        l:F

         x:L   c:D'  v:D   b:R'          n:L   m:D'  ,:D   .:R'

* shifted keys for turning the cube itself.  again, available on both
hands.  3 axes of rotation, two directions each ==> only 6 keys needed on
each hand.  but why not have even more duplication?  for example, suppose
(in real life) you want to roll the cube forward away from you.  you might
do it by either grabbing it from the R side or the L side.  hence the same
10 keys as above, when shifted, work to turn the entire cube in the same
direction as they turn the faces when unshifted.

Or a extension of your scheme might be to combine arrow keys with the
keypad, in a two-handed approach.

I.e. 6^ or 6v rather than 36 or 69; no order dependence this way.
(Likewise, I find the arrow keys more mnemomic.)  The model is that you're
"grabbing" the specified cubie and rotating it in the specified direction.

In its most natural form, this assumes that the numeric key-pad and the
arrow keys are separate (as they are on my keyboard), although one could
certainly use some other set of "directional" keys aside from the standard
arrow keys.

And as I say, this also assumes --most naturally, although not
necessarily-- a two-handed approach.

For completeness, too, there is also the slice between the front and back
face.

Rather than muddy the paradigm, perhaps other (non-assigned) keys should
be used.

The handy "0" key might make a natural candidate for the front face.

On the other hand since the back face and middle slice are rather
"pathological" cases in this paradigm, might it perhaps make sense to use
keys "outside" the model?  For example "R" and "M".  (Or, less
mnemonically --and depending on the set-up of your keyboard-- "/" or "*"
or ".", which on my keyboard are right beside the numeric keypad keys.)

(For these last cases, perhaps on the <- and -> keys should by
operational.  The up and down arrows being less meaningful here.)

This seems like a good scheme.

If anyone has a Spaceball, it should make quite a nice input device.
It senses both torque about all 3 orthog. axes, and linear
displacement forces ditto; a total of 6 channels. Displacement could
select a layer, which could be highlighted (anyone for alpha-channel
translucency?), and torque would rotate the selected layer.

Except that it is typically quite difficult to separately control
translation and rotation with these devices.

Immediately after reading this mail, my concept of a "keyboard interface"
almost popped up immediately.  It is similar to the 1-9 keypad interface
mentioned already.

[Assume that the person is using a standard American QWERTY keyboard;
 remap if necessary.]

First, represent the front face by

q w e
a s d
z x c

A "move" is represented by any two ordered keystrokes.  If the two keystrokes
are in the same row, it represents a horizontal layer moving, else
if they're in the same row, it represents a vertical layer moving.

Example:
 "ed" = R'
 "cd" = R
 "sd" = slice move
 "we" = U'
 "qe" = U'
 "qw" = U'

This method does not have moves for rotating the three front to back layers
nor 180-degree moves.

Extension A:  Make a gap of a key represent a 180-degree move.
 So, "qe" is now U2 instead of just U'.

Extension B:  Represent front-to-back layers by the unused key combinations.
 This will necessarily be idiomatic (so I don't like it).  For example,
 you could have "knight moves" represent F and B turns, and combinations
 with the "s" be slice moves.

Extension C:  Add another grid for the right side of the cube:
 r t y
 f g h
 v b n
 This solves the problem of the front-to-back layers nicely, and adds
 some redundancy.  Most cube programs should display more than one face
 to the user anyway!

Extension D:  Use the arrow keys to rotate the entire cube.  This can
 be done by the right hand while the left hand is just turning faces, which
 is similar to how a lot of people solve the cube anyway.  This also
 alleviates the problem of the front-to-back layers.

I would implement all extensions, but leave A and B as "optional" for the
user to turn off as desired.

Subject: square-1 and megeminx

Is there a world record for the the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5 rubiks cubes?
If so what is it?

I was wondering what in your opinion is the hardest rubiks like cube
available right now.

On a web page several people from rated the greatest to least in
difficulty:

1)square-1
2)megaminx
3)5x5x5
4)4x4x4
5)?
6)?

Anyway it went something like that. Would you agree? I learnt how to
do square-1 all by myself.

Would you consider Square-1 one of the hardest cubes to do? If so would
this be considered good of me to learn? Although I only tried about 4
times my record when it was in a cube is 2 minutes. Do you know of a
world record for Square-1 or any good websites? Do you know what an
average would be for the best time? (perhaps 90 seconds for those
really into it?)

I was wondering how this compares to others times and acomplishments. At
http://byrden.com/puzzles/ I almost figured out the megaminx. I got
everything except the last row. Is the Megaminx one of the hardest
Rubiks like puzzles available? After I get bored of my 5x5x5 that I
orderd thinking about buying the megaminx. Do you know of a world record
on the megaminx? What would be a average time (perhaps 3-4 minutes?)

If you are not sure of answers thats fine. Then do you know of any good
websites I can go to?

Thank you very much.

If anybody wants a SpaceOrb 360 (for experimentation please, I generally
don't just give away stuff out of the kindness of my heart, although
that's not unknown either) just drop me an email with a mailing
address.  I still have the box around here somewhere, just don't
remember where.  If I dig around long enough I know I can find the
instructions too.  I don't have it in front of me, but I'm sure it's
just a serial device like a mouse.

Recently I've acquired a couple of older cubes from ebay.  One was sold as
"the original rubik's cube" by Ideal.  When I opened it up I noticed that
the quality was not the same as my original cube that I bought in 1980 or
so.  The stickers were not as bright for one thing.  On my "original" cube
the orange stickers are almost fluorescent, whereas on this version the
color is dull, and its not a faded version of the original color.  Its
clearly a different shade of orange.  The yellow and green colors are not as
bright.

And then there is the center white sticker.  On some older Ideal cubes there
is a logo on it, on this one I just got the logo was a separate decal.  On
my 1980's cube there is no logo at all.

Next we come to differences in the actual pieces.  On some Ideal cubes the
cubies are solid, well, probably hollow in the center, but there is no
openining.  But on others there is an opening.

Does anyone know anything about the history of the Ideal cube?  Were there
different runs of production?  Did they start "cutting corners" to lower
cost?  Is there any way to tell from the packaging, which cube is the
version that has the nice bright colors?

Sorry if this has been discussed in the past, I'm relatively new to this
list...

[ Moderator: The archives have quite a bit about various types of
  cubes.  Are you sure the open-corner cubes were from Ideal?  I
  thought those were the pirated knockoffs. ]

Dear Cube-Lovers list:

I received several very interesting replies to my e-mail last week
regarding inventing techniques to solving cube puzzles.  Here are some
excerpts of note that were e-mailed to me but not the list.

First, part of what I wrote ...

Later, at my request, Wei-Hwa Huang was kind enough to elaborate on
conjugation.

I also received a good suggestion that discovering new sequences may
be easier on a computer simulator.  This, way the cube can be reset to
the solved state quickly before each new attempt to make it easier to
see what the trial sequence actually changes.  Unfortunately, I lost
this particular e-mail and forget who sent it, so I cannot attribute
it.  My apologies to the author.

For anyone who is interested in trying out a simulator that can be
operated in an instant-response keyboard mode, I have christened my
web-pages by uploading a copy of my cube simulator.  In this mode, the
function keys do face, centre-slice and whole-cube turns for the
3x3x3, and alphabetic keys can also be used for the same purpose.

L, U, F and R are assigned to F5 to F8, so it's reasonably easy to
work up a rhythm.  Squares and inverses are done with Shift and
Control, though as Jerry Bryan pointed out repeated jabbing is at
least as easy.  These keys also work for 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes, with
the alphabetic keys b f u d l r used for the off-centre slices.

I mainly wrote the simulator to show me the effects of turns in
Singmaster notation and common variants such as are found in
cube-lovers.  It's in Qbasic, which is the limit of my knowledge, and
is a lot less sophisticated in appearance than the simulators
available on the web - no mouse operations and no nice visible turning
of the layers while you watch for instance, and distinctly rudimentary
interactions with external files - so I am not offering it to the
world in general, but it does have some features I haven't seen
elsewhere that may appeal to Cube-lovers readers.

Among them are that it can be set to show the effect of the turns on
the centre pieces: it shows their orientation as little clock-hands
that point to 12 o'clock in their home positions.  The orientation of
each piece's pointer then allows its identity to be deduced.  I don't
really feel I've understood the effects of a sequence unless I can see
what it does to the centres.

Also (this is a party trick, really) it can be set to work as a cube
with any number of pieces per edge from two to 15, using an extension
of normal Singmaster notation - no keyboard mode for these cubes.

The program can be downloaded from

    home.iclweb.com/icl1/roger.broadie

I won't necessarily keep it there all that long.

Yes, I'm sure the open corner cubes I have are Ideal.  Unless the pirates
put them in Ideal boxes.  I own three Ideal cubes.  I also have a siamese
cube, which looks like it started life as regular Ideal cubes and those
corners are closed.  And the new OddzOn cubes are solid too.

this is sort of a grab-and-move interface (in my mental picture, one
keypress "grabs" a face, and the next "moves" it).  i think i might like
this paradigm better than my own suggestion of before (unshifted single
keystrokes for face moves, shifted single keystrokes for cube rotations).
one nice advantage is that it makes it as easy on the keyboard interface as
it is in real life to do RL' and R'L, for which i suspect most people's
mental model is really a single turn of the middle slice.

i think i'd prefer some different key assignments than wei-hwa suggests,
though.  for example, i think i'd like to "grab" with the middle key in the
line, and then "move" with the outer one.  for example:
    "de" = R
    "dc" = R'
(according to wei-hwa's definition of "move", our two suggestions are
compatible.  mine only adds redundancy.)

>This method does not have moves for rotating the three front to back layers
>nor 180-degree moves.

another suggestion for 180-degree moves:  allow the user to tap the second
key in the sequence 2 (or 3) times for 180 (or 270 aka 90') degree moves.
thus, e.g., "wee" = U2.  this is intuitive not only to me:  someone else
posted that in their keyboard interface of years ago, they didn't use the
specially-assigned 180 keys, but in practice just tapped the 90-keys twice
anyway.

an additional suggested extension:  let me do things with both hands!
(this is my favorite aspect of my own keyboard interface, posted a few days
ago.)

perhaps a similar nonad(?) of keys could be used for R-face-relative
operations analogous to the F-face-relative ones above.  this is like
wei-hwa's extension C, except i'd rather use my right hand in its "normal"
typing position.

how about a third set, in the middle of the keyboard somewhere, for doing
D-relative things?

Gotcha.  And your idea seems sound.  But...

Arrow keys are sufficiently nonstandard I would very much prefer
something else - say, a shifted slice move to rotate the whole cube.
(Under some reasonable circumstances it can be hard to even tell what
you'll see for "the arrow keys", if they even exist.)

In passing,

I'd probably prefer

I might even argue in favor of w e r / s d f / x c v for the other set,
simply because they're the home keys for the three principal fingers of
the left hand.

Other than that, it sounds like an eminently reasonable approach.

Subject: Re: Keyboard cube [Layout for Speed Cubing]
To: noel@mud.ca
Cc: Cube Lovers <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

Hi,

This is a very interesting problem.  I've been scratching my head for a
while, and I've cooked up with a keyboard combination that could work
for virtual speed cubing.  I tried to follow a few guidelines: speed
cubing friendly; ergonomic and intuitive.

There are of course, two types of rotations that are required to solve
the cube: body rotations (rotate the whole cube) and slice rotations
(rotate individual faces).  For each type of rotation there are three
additional sub-types.  For body rotations, there are three axes x, y
and z.  For slice rotations, there are 1/4-turn clockwise, 1/4-turn
counterclockwise and 1/2-turn.

Let's define the three body axes as follows: the z-axis will intersect
the U and D faces.  The x-axis will intersect the F and B faces. The
y-axis will intersect the R and L faces.

 Okay, now ergonomics.  When I solve the cube, I notice that my left
hand does most of the body rotations and my right hand does most of the
slice rotations.  I tried to keep this intuition in assigning keyboard
keys by making the left hand perform body rotations and the right hand
perform slice rotations (well, sort of...).  The most intuitive form
that I could think of for your hands to be in is the fetal or "clawed"
position.  This can be satisfied by placing the left-hand fingers on
the A, W, E and F keys and right-hand fingers on the J, I, O and ; keys
(assuming a QWERTY keyboard layout).  To be speed cubing friendly,
these 8 fingers should never have to leave these keyboard key
assignments.
__________________________________________________________________________________
For body rotations, the keyboard key assignments could be:
F - clockwise body rotation about the y-axis (i.e. if we were rotating
    a face it would be R)
E - clockwise body rotation about the x-axis (i.e. if we were rotating
    a face it would be F)
W - clockwise body rotation about the z-axis (i.e. if we were rotating
    a face it would be U)

To perform a counter-clockwise body rotation, hit the SPACEBAR key with
the right thumb in combination with the key assigment (e.g. F and
SPACEBAR)
__________________________________________________________________________________
For the slice rotations, the keyboard 2-key assignments could be:
F and J - 1/4-turn clockwise of the L-face
F and I - 1/4-turn clockwise of the R-face
F and O - 1/4-turn clockwise of R-face and 1/4-turn counterclockwise of
the L-face

E and J - 1/4-turn clockwise of the F-face
E and I - 1/4-turn clockwise of the B-face
E and O - 1/4-turn clockwise of the F-face and 1/4-turn
counterclockwise of the B-face

W and J - 1/4-turn clockwise of the U-face
W and I - 1/4-turn clockwise of the D-face
W and O - 1/4-turn clockwise of the U-face and 1/4-turn
counterclockwise of the D-face

To perform 1/4-turn counterclockwise slice rotations, hit the SPACEBAR
key with the right thumb in combination with the 2-key assignment (e.g.
F and J and SPACEBAR)

To perform 1/2-turn slice rotations, hit the N key with the right thumb
in combination with the 2-key assignment
(e.g. F and J and N)
__________________________________________________________________________________
I've ordered the keys in order of their importance.  As you can see the
J key is responsible for "LEFT-LIKE" slice rotations
I key is responsible for "RIGHT-LIKE" slice rotations
O key is responsible for middle slice rotations

You might ask, why make O the middle slice and not I, since it's the
middle key?  Well, when you actually solve the cube, you never move the
middle slice.  You only move the left and right slices to effectively
move the middle slice.  Furthermore, this operation is performed much
more seldomly than normal R and L slice rotations.

Anyways, you can see with this keyboard mapping you only need a total
of  8 keys to perform all of possible rotations you need to solve the
cube.

If we really want to make this speed cubing friendly we could also do
the following:
-body rotations should be performed in real-time; the speed of rotation
should be an adjustable constant that the user can tweak to his or her
preference
-slice rotations should be instantaneous.  There's really no point in
watching a slice rotate.  Just wasting time...

There are two separate ideas here.

A process of the form XYX'Y' is called a commutator rather than a conjugate.
As you say, a commutator which moves very few cubies can be a very useful
process.  In fact, the number of cubies moved by XYX'Y' can be used as a sort
of informal measure of how close X and Y come to commuting. In the extreme case
where X and Y do commute, we have XYX'Y'=YXX'Y'=YY'=I so that no cubies are
moved. And conversely, two processes X and Y which "nearly" commute and/or
which intersect in very few cubies are good candidates for forming a useful
commutator.

A process of the form Y'XY is called a conjugate, and in particular is called
the conjugate of X by Y.  Note that YXY' is also a conjugate, and in particular
is called the conjugate of X by Y'.  This can be a little confusing because a
few books (incorrectly in my opinion) call YXY' the conjugate of X by Y.

Of Y and Y', which is the "real" process and which is the inverse is totally
arbitrary.  For example, if Z=Y', then Z'=Y.  So we could write a conjugate as
YXZ (the conjugate of X by Z) and another conjugate as ZXY (the conjugate of X
by Y) if we know that Y and Z are respectively the inverses of each other.

It is sometimes said that the conjugate Y'XY results in X shifted by Y, which
is the real utility of using conjugates to solve a cube.  Use a process you
know, but shift it to apply to a slightly different set of cubies.

Your process A=R'DRFDF' consists of the conjugates R'DR (the conjugate of D by
R) and FDF' (the conjugate of D by F').  It is often the case that useful
processes can be formed from both commutators and conjugates.

I am perversely proud that my own personal solution technique for solving the
cube consists of only two processes  --  one for the corners and one for the
edges  --  plus conjugates of those two processes.  I think it is indicative
of the power of conjugates that a cube can be solved with so few processes
provided only that they are combined with conjugation.  I am "perversely proud"
because my "two processes" technique probably yields one of the slowest
solution times of anybody on Cube-Lovers. I am always embarrassed to read about
those people who can do it in under 30 seconds.  I have taught myself some of
the faster techniques, but I always find that after a few months the only
technique my hands can remember is the old, slow one which I invented myself
many years ago.

How about giving the player a choice between using a default

Another cool feature would be two simultaneous cubes, so players can

I added support for the SpaceOrb 360 by SpaceTec to Puzzler, grab this
version at:

http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/Puzzler.EXE

You must have a SpaceOrb 360 to try it out, but it is very very nice to use
compared to the mouse.  Twist the orb to rotate the puzzle, and press the
buttons and twist to do moves.  After a little practice you'll be able to
solve a cube like it was in your hands!

Only the cubes (all sizes) have support for the SpaceOrb, I may add support
for the other puzzles at a later date.

Regarding Mike Reid's program, I compiled it fine with DJGPP, an MSDOS compiler,
but it didn't run. Any ideas?
I'll probably get a windows compiler soon.
Anyway, two other points I was thinking of recently.

Firstly, do any of the kociemba algorithm search programs use the fact
that you can perform a depth n search by 3 depth n-1 searches using the
3 orthogonal orientations? (if my logic is correct!)
This is because if you are using the <U,D,L2,R2,B2,F2> group for the final
phase, the last move of any depth n sequence must end in a square move,
in which case the n-1 will easily find it, or else a quarter turn in which
case the three orientations are required to make it found in the second
phase. Unfortuneately I doubt the n-1 searches could be replaced by n-2
searches.

Also when a cube is being scrambled adjacent cubes tend to stay
together for a while. Has this been of any use in search methods?
(eg. to help prune the search tree). Obvously a sequence like
F2 B2 U2 D2 L2 R2 separates all adjoining pairs, but there is still a
high degree of order with next to adjacent cubes, so maybe they could be
used as well.

First, let's make sure everyone remembers that we're using  X' as an
abbreviation for  X^(-1)  for inverses of permutations.  People really
should read the archives, at <ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/cube-lovers>

I tried to explain this a while ago, but it's such a subtle,
counterintuitive point that I had better try again.  One form of
conjugate is correct, and the other form is incorrect, but just which
is correct depends on how you write function composition.  The point is
that there are two schools of function composition, "leftward" and
"rightward", and the choice of your function composition determines
how you define conjugates.  It's surprising that a notational
convention can have this sort of effect, but we'll see it does.

First, I'll describe the two schools of composition.  It will be
convenient to consider a set  X  and two permutations  f  and  g  on
X.  Let  h:X->X  be the unique permutation that satisfies  h(x) = f(g(x))
for all  x  in  X.  We could let  f, g,  and  h  be any functions, not
just permutations, but we will need for them to be permutations later,
when we use the group structure.

How do we write  h  in terms of  f  and  g?  The rightward school says
h = g f.  This is the way we have been writing things on cube-lovers
all along: we write  g f  for applying a permutation  g  to something
and then applying  f  to the result.  But remember that we write
h(x) = f(g(x)),  which is to say that  (g f)(x) = f(g(x)).  The fact
that the order of  f  and  g  depends on the parenthesization is often
considered ugly, so some seriously rightward people write the function
name after the arguments: That is to say,  they write  (x)f  instead
of  f(x),  (x)g  instead of  g(x),  and  (x)h = ((x)g)f = (x)(g f).
This makes function composition a kind of associative law.  If you're
seeing this for the first time, I'm sure you consider it a bizarre and
useless and gratuitously confusing complication, but I assure you that
rightward functions are in wide use in some branches of the
mathematical community, chiefly in abstract algebra.  But cube-lovers
was started by computer programmers, not algebraists, and programmers
have  f(x)  very tightly wired into their minds and parsers.  So
cube-lovers uses rightward composition with leftward functions, and we
say  (g f)(x) = f(g(x)).  As for swapping the order of  f  and  g,  we
just get over it, but there are some people out there who will call us
disfunctional.

The leftward composition school takes a different approach: they say
h(x)=f(g(x))  means  h = f g.  When you follow a cube process written
by these people, you have to perform it from the right to the left.
This is also a little hard to get used to, but at least we have an
"associative" rule,  (f g)(x) = f(g(x)),  with  f  and  g  in the same
order, without having to write our functions after the arguments.  For
this reason, most mathematicians other than algebraists find leftward
composition to be more natural.  You probably learned leftward
composition in calculus or whenever.  But on cube-lovers no-one wanted
to write all their cube processes from right to left, so we've pretty
much forgotten about leftward composition on the list.  Remember,
though, leftward composition is pretty standard for a lot of
mathematics, and it works better for the way we write functions, so
you can't really call it wrong.  And there are people who say that if
we are going to write our functions to the left we also ought to
compose them to the left.

So far so good.  The rightward and leftward schools write the
composition of functions in opposite orders, but either way the
permutations still form a group under composition.  As long as you
don't mix them, it shouldn't change anything else, should it?  But it
really does change the definition of conjugation.  (Remember
conjugation?  This is a message about conjugation.)

Suppose we have a group  G,  not necessarily a permutation group.
Conjugation is one way of mapping  G  to a permutation group, where
the set being permuted is the set of group elements of G.  For an
element  s,  I'll define the right conjugate of  s,  R_s,  as the
permutation for which  R_s(g) = s' g s  for all  g  in  G.  Similarly,
the left conjugate of  s,  L_s  is defined by  L_s(g) = s g s'  for
all  g.  It's important to notice that in either case, conjugation by
a product is the composition of conjugations.  For letting  s  and  t
be two specific elements of  G,  we can carry out manipulations that
hold for all elements  g  of G.  I'll calculate with the left
conjugate in the left column and the right conjugate in the right
column:

    L_s(g) = s g s';                R_s(g) = s' g s;

    L_t(g) = t g t';                R_t(g) = t' g t;

    L_st(g) = (st) g (st)'          R_st(g) = (st)' g (st)
            = s t g t' s'                   = t' s' g s t
            = L_s(t g t')                   = R_t(s' g s)
            = L_s(L_t(g))                   = R_t(R_s(g))    (*)


These calculations were carried out using the group operation of  G,
independently of how we write function composition.  But let's look at
how we write the composition in our two notations.

In the rightward composition that cube-lovers has been using all
along, (*) shows that  L_st = L_t L_s  and  R_st = R_s R_t.  So the
mapping  s |-> L_s  is an _antihomomorphism_--it reverses the order of
multiplication--but  s |-> R_s  is a homomorphism.  Homomorphisms are
a lot nicer than antihomomorphisms, so we should use right conjugation
all the time, right?

But consider the people who use leftward composition, (f g)(x)=f(g(x)).
So the function composition in (*) is now written  L_st = L_s L_t  and
R_st = R_t R_s.  So with leftward composition, _left_ conjugation is
the homomorphism, and _right_ conjugation is the antihomomorphism.

It is so very convenient for conjugation to be a homomorphism that
people who use rightward composition always use right conjugation, and
people who use leftward composition always use left conjugation (unless
they think it doesn't matter and guess wrong).  We're rightward
composers on cube-lovers, so conjugation by  s  is  g |-> s' t s,  but
remember that most math texts (other than algebra) will use the
leftward composition, and so they will correctly use left conjugation,
g |-> s g s'.

I learned this from Jim Saxe, when I tried using left conjugation in
the Symmetry and Local Maxima message.  Jim told me that unless I
wanted to start using leftward composition I had better use right
conjugation, but I was pretty sure it really didn't matter.  Jim just
splained and splained until he got across how much it really does
matter, and why the only right answer is different in different books.
Now I've done it for you, and I hope it helps.

And they said that consistency was the hobgoblin of little minds....

I'd like to say that the cube program from Mr. Broadie is quite nice,
actually is something I have been searching for for a while and something I
requested to several Web based cube programers and never found, the ability
to have a sequence interfase is something very useful mostly when you are
looking for patterns and you find these lists on the web that don't show the
actual result but just describe it with some sort of complicated notation,
trying to do it with a real cube is a real pain since you have to do all the
moves and if you make a mistake you have to start all over again by solving
the cube and then making the moves that would take you to the final pattern.
Well done Mr. Broadie and keep up the good work, please let the list know
when you have the Windows version  ready. ;-)

 The lubes I remember from the archives are vaseline (greasy, erodes

I think most auto parts stores sell a silicone spray lubricant.  I don't
know what the brand names are.  I have used this on my cubes and it
works well.  After you first apply it, the cube will seem stiff, but if
you keep turning it for a while it starts working.

Another alternative for Windows is Herbert Kociemba's Cube Explorer 1.5, which
is easily found with Web based search engines, and which I think can also be
found on the download section of the Cube-Lovers site.

Cube Explorer 1.5 does not allow you to type in a maneuver directly, which I
think is what you are after. But it will do something just about as good, and
in some ways even better. It will read in a standard ASCII text file which
contains maneuvers in standard Singmaster notation (the BFUDLR notation), and
it will then show you the end product.  The file can contain any (reasonable)
number of maneuvers, and the program will show you the end product for each
maneuver all in one fell swoop (or swell foop, if you prefer).

One thing Cube Explorer 1.5 does not support that you may be looking for is to
manipulate the cube and look at each intermediate position.  But that's usually
not what I am looking for.  I am usually looking for the end product of a
maneuver.  (Of course, you could put each intermediate position into your ASCII
text file.)

You can create the ASCII text file for Cube Explorer 1.5 by typing maneuvers
into the file with the text editor of your choice.  But most typically I just
cut and paste maneuvers out of an E-mail into the text file, and then have Cube
Explorer 1.5 read the file.  It's much easier and less error prone than typing
the maneuvers myself.

Here is a case where Cube Explorer 1.5 may be "even better".  Take a
Cube-Lovers message with lots of maneuvers, cut and paste the whole thing into
an ASCII text file, and read the file into Cube Explorer 1.5.  Instantly, you
see the positions for all the maneuvers.  You don't even have to worry about
deleting the extraneous non-maneuver text from the E-mail.  For example, take
Mike Reid's lists of minimal maneuvers for highly symmetric positions, or take
my lists of local maxima and put them into Cube Explorer 1.5 in this fashion.
The results are quite pretty.  There are many other messages in the Cube-Lovers
archives with lots of pretty patterns, but these two come to mind quickly.

(By the way, converting BFUDLR strings to a graphical representation of a
position is an extremely useful feature of Cube Explorer 1.5, but it has
several other nice features. For example, you can give it a graphical
representation of a position and get back very quickly --  in a matter of
seconds -- a very good suboptimal maneuver for that position.)

Silicon in its (relatively) pure form is somewhat difficult to get hold
of and probably not a very good lubricant.  You probably mean silicone.

I don't know how well it works - I haven't perceived a need for
lubricants for my Cubes - but one I wouldn't write off without trying
is graphite, available easily and cheaply as pencil lead, the softer
the pencil the better.  The major downside I would expect is black dust
rubbing off on fingers and to a lesser extent everything you set the
Cube down on.  (But it's a kind of black dust that washes off easily.)

White powder, used like graphite, sometimes for locks? Possibly
Tri-Flow (tm), which (iirc) is a Teflon (tm) particle suspension.

I experimented with quite a variety of lubricants, found a good one,
and then one of the periodic disruptions of my life came along and I
failed to note which it was! :(

"Teflon" is a Du Pont trade name for PTFE, polytetrafluoroethylene.

Btw, in case you do a Web search, watch "silicon" vs. "silicone".
The chemist who coined the term "silicone" was wildly optimistic
about people's ability to keep the two straight. Silicon, the
chemical element, is gray, opaque to visible light, brittle like
glass, and a lousy lubricant. You don't normally see it, nor can you
normally buy it.

Silicones are chemical compounds that include the chemical element,
silicon.

Subject: Cube-manipulation programs

Well, with the current discussion going on about Cube manipulation
programs, I'll toss out my minor contribution the genre.

It's a C program that takes simple text lines describing maneuvers and
prints out a text representation of the resulting cube, together with
its cycle structure.  (I specifically chose to make it text-only
because I'm comparatively often on text-only links.)  It also allows
you to define names for operations and then use them as primitives.

A sample transcript, which defines the Spratt wrench as an operator and
then uses it to flip the four F-face edges:

> .set WRENCH (SLICER F)4
`WRENCH' defined
> WRENCH F2 WRENCH F2
Cube:
              u u u
              u u u
              u f u
        l l l f u f r r r b b b
        l l f l f r f r r b b b
        l l l f d f r r r b b b
              d f d
              d d d
              d d d
Cycles: (uf)+ (lf)+ (fr)+ (fd)+ [2]
Already centered

Another example:

> F SLICER F'
Cube:
              u f u
              u f u
              u u u
        l l l f f f r r r b l b
        l l f r d d b r r b u b

>

The numbers in [ ] are the smallest power to which that operator must
be raised to get the identity.

While I don't expect it ever attain the popularity of slick graphics
programs, there may be a few people interested in it; if anyone is, you
have only to drop me a line asking for a copy....

Puzzler does support cube move macros, in standard UDFBLR notation (use
udfblr in lowercase for inner slices and meM for central slices in the 5x5x5
cube).  To use this feature hit enter and enter the move...F2 will move the
F slice 2 times, F3 and F' are equivalent and will move counterclockwise 1
time, F1 and F move clockwise 1 time.  You can enter any number of moves in
sequence in a string then by hitting enter again the move will be executed.

One more note: these macros assume the cube is oriented so that you can see
three faces (exactly like the initial orientation of the cube).  So F refers
the the bottom left face, R is the bottom right face and U is the upper
face.

  /\
 /  \
|\U /|
| \/ |
\F|R/
 \|/

Last note: I assumed that UDFBLR was the notation used by most people.
However if there is another notation that is used or if some other notation
is required for experimentation, let me know and I'll put it in.

	Ideal certainly did use oriental suppliers when the Great Cube Craze

for sure if they ever sold the open cornered versions.  I definitely don't
recall examples with markedly different colors.  When Rubik's Fourth Dimension

presumably from China or thereabouts.  One person at the launch said hers broke

 In the US there exists a magazine called, "Inventor's Digest"  which
 I have a subscribtion to and which is currently running a series of
 articles about building prototypes from molds.  It would probably be
 just what you are looking for.  It explains the whole process.  If you
 want, I can get subscription information for you or information on how
 to order individual articles.  You may wish to look in your local
 library to see if they carry the magazine (au = australia?) but I'm
 not sure your country would carry it.  If you want I will send you
 excerpts just ask.  (is this something the whole list would want to find
 out about?)

I just checked my copy; it does not contain this sort of

I've been playing around with something like this myself.  It doesn't
work yet,
but you can look at

I got inspired by all of the recent discussion of input methods and
started thinking about visual representations.

Subject: Rubiks Cube, Megaminx and Square-1 

Is there a world record for the the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5 rubiks cubes?
If so what is it?

I was wondering what in your opinion is the hardest rubiks like cube
available right now.

On a web page several people from rated the greatest to least in
difficulty:

1)square-1
2)megaminx
3)5x5x5
4)4x4x4
5)?
6)?

Anyway it went something like that.

Would you consider Square-1 one of the hardest cubes to do? If so would
this be considered good of me to learn all by myself? My best time is
83 sec. As if now I am not sure what my average is.  Do you know of
a world record for Square-1 or any good websites? Do you know what an
average would be for the best time?

I was wondering how this compares to others times and accomplishments. At
http://byrden.com/puzzles/ I almost figured out the megaminx. I got
everything except the last row. Is the Megaminx one of the hardest
Rubiks like puzzles available? After I get bored of my 5x5x5 that I
ordered thinking about buying the megaminx. Do you know of a world record
on the megaminx? What would be a average time (perhaps 3-4 minutes?)

Currently I am more interested in the Rubiks cube. Lately I have been
trying to improve my time. I have a personal record of 50 seconds, and
an average time of about 80 seconds. However, I learned how to do the cube
all by myself. I didn't get help from others, websites, books...
I was wondering If you learned by yourself or if you got help? Then what
is your time?

I don't believe that I will ever get much faster. Learning by yourself
is a really hard task. I was wondering if there is any one out there who
agrees that getting help from resources is cheating?

In my opinion they make the people who haved learned by themselves look
bad. This is just my opinion, you don't have to agree.

If you are not sure of answers that's fine. Then do you know of any good
websites I can go to?

Thank you very much.

	The technique of solving the cube by use of commutators and conjugates
is what most people worked out in the early days.  However, I can testify that
it took us some time to realise that one could use second level commutation.
That is, FRF'R' = [F,R] only affects seven pieces, but in fact it only affects
one piece in the L face, so taking the commutator with the L face produces a
3-cycle of corners.  Likewise  [F,R]^2  only twists one corner in the L face
and combining it with turns of L allows you to twist three corners the same way
or two corners opposite ways.

Hi,

I think it's great that you learned to do the cube all by yourself.  I
give much respect to anyone who solved any of these twisty puzzles.
Very few people have the ability and the time to figure them out.  I'm
curious if you are willing to share your methods?

I personally learned from a book.  Afterwards, I kind of wished I
hadn't.  Since then, I promised myself not to look at any more solutions
for any new puzzles I encounter.  So far, all I've managed to solve  on
my own is the pyraminx. (very easy compared to the cube)

I can see how you might feel a little disgruntled about others achieving
quick solving times with aid from outside resources.  I am an example of
that.  In about 4 months I achieved a 36 second average after scouring
the net for every bit of information I could find.  You shouldn't think
it makes you look bad.  If anything, I feel bad knowing that people like
you must put a lot of hard work into it, while I had a much easier time.
It still takes a lot of hard physical and mental work on my part to
achieve a fast average, but a lot of the mental work was already done
for me.

As far as cheating is concerned, in my and many others' defense, I must
respond, as the majority of people in this group have referred to
outside information at one point or another.  Consider speed cubing as a
sport just like any other in the Olympics.  Everyone is going to use
every resource available to win.  No one in the Olympics is going to try
and win (or succeed for that matter) all by themselves w/out any help or
coaching at all.  The use of outside help brings those who use it to a
higher level playing field.  These people are in an equal playing field
among themselves having access to the same resources.  If people choose
to learn on their own, it is only fair to put them in a different group
rather than lumping everyone in the same group.  But just because people
have accessed other resources, doesn't mean they will all of a sudden
reach less than a minute averages, it still takes a lot of hard work to
get there.  I know your average is still better than a lot of people who
got help.

On the other hand, getting help on learning how to solve the cube might
be considered cheating just as it would be when one gets hints to a
riddle or looks in the back of the book for all the answers.

I don't think there is anything wrong with help at all, unless your goal
is to do it all on your own without any help.  You said that you don't
believe that you will ever get much faster.  If your skill level
plateaus, I don't see anything wrong with using any resources available
to exceed your limits.  That's what help is for!  You can still be proud
of your accomplishments, but everyone has their limits.  There are very
few people who have achieved what you have.

When I learned how to solve the cube (some 20 years back, I think...),
I was taught a layer-by-layer solution, consisting of 'modular' moves.
Most of the modularity occurs on the 3rd layer, namely:
- In flipping the edges, I use (RE)^4 to flip the UR edge. Then, I move
  the top layer so that there's another edge to be flipped at the UR
  position and I repeat the same procedure.
- In rotating the edges, I was taught the above-mentioned {R,F]^2 to
  rotate an edge by 120 degrees. Later, I 'discovered' that [F,R]^2
  does the same thing backward.

Most other layer-by-layer methods I've seen have formulas to flip 2
edges in the top layer, but you'll need two for the different confi-
gurations. Also, these methods mostly have two, three or more formulas
to rotate the edges in the toplayer, depending on configuration.

My method may not be the fastest around (it takes me about 2 minutes
to solve The Cube), but I don't need many formulas for it:

1st layer: on my own (make a cross, fill in the corners)
2nd layer: 2 formulas (standard layer 3 to layer 2 swing, two directions)
3rd layer: 4 (exchange edges, flip one edge, exchange corners, rotate
           one corner)

WD-40 will make it stick REALLY badly! Please don't do it.  Not
because it will dissolve the plastic (although it might), but because
it's too thin. Also I have seen in the past a problem with the kind of
solvents in this kind of product where it seems to 'realise' any small
cracks in plastic, causing it to just fall to bits the next day.
Silicone grease sounds good to me.

[ Moderator's note: I'll remind you that last month Alex Montilla
  suggested (for low-quality tiled cubes), "If you use WD-40, it'll
  eat away at the plastic resulting in really smooth turning.  It'll
  be great for about 3-4 weeks of daily cubing, but the WD-40 will
  take its toll, and the cube will start falling apart.  But for a few
  bucks every 3-4 weeks is worth it to me."  So WD-40 is bad for the
  cube, but possibly good for the turning, at least temporarily.

The only record for a 4x4x4 I saw was 117 or 170+ seconds, I can't
remember which.  BTW, that was my web page you visited. :)

The reason I think that the Square-1 is rated so high is because it
"mutates" in form and shape as you twist it.  All other puzzles remain
mechanically symmetrical to themselves (even the pyramorphix, while
changing shape, is still the same basic architecture underneath).  The
Square-1's possible moves change as you mix it, causing an extra level
of confusion.  Does this make it tougher to solve?

Learning to solve puzzles by yourself is great.  Unlike some others on
the cube list, I've always relied on intuition and mental picturing to
make all of my moves.  This has allowed me to solve puzzles since I was
about six years old.  The only puzzles I have been unable to solve this
way are the Rubik's Cube series (2^3 through 5^3), specifically the
corner moves.  Everything else I was able to do independently at one
Time or another including the center pieces on the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5.

A quick anecdote.  For the longest Time I didn't bother scrambling my
Geomaster Masterball for fear of messing it up.  That barrier was
overcome when a friend of mine inadvertently scrambled it for me.  14
hours of hair pulling later I came up with a "logical" solution for it
(that actually helped me solve the Dogic later).  Of course, shortly
afterwards they sold Masterballs with solutions far simpler than mine,
but I still prefer using my method, because it's mine.

This shouldn't have any effect on the plastic, I am not sure about the
mechanisms although I still have my very first cube and it is still in
working order (albeit a bit loose because of age).

White lithium grease is pretty good, but I don't know about its long term
effects on plastic. If anyone has ever changed a distributor / points on an
old car, there is a small tube of grease that is intended to be used on a
plastic metal contact point. It is actually absorbed by the plastic and
allows it to remain quite frictionless. If you want some good advice on
this stuff look for an auto parts store with people that know more than
just what they read from the packages or an older mechanic.

Date: 26 Apr 1999 18:03:02 GMT
Organization: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena
Message-Id: <7g29om$4ua@gap.cco.caltech.edu>

I skimmed through Singmaster's "Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube" this weekend.
It was rather disappointing to realize that the techniques I had invented
five years ago had all been independently invented twenty years ago!

In any case, I thought I might share my thoughts about monoflips with the
list.

--------------

[I shall use "E" to denote moving the center slice (between the U and D
faces) to the left (so that the F center becomes the L center).  E' I
will use to denote its inverse.
In other words, E is the same as U'D followed by rotating the entire
cube clockwise from the point of view of the U face.
Similarly, I will use M to denote moving the L-R slice "up".
Traditionally, a slice is counted as two turns, although it is usually
easier to perform than two orthogonal turns.]

As you may know, a "monoflip" is a sequence of moves that flips one edge
on a given face (usually the U face) while not affecting the rest of the
face.  For instance, this is a monoflip:

  F E F M FF M' (10 turns)

This flips the FU edge cubie.  If you do this sequence of moves, it is
particularly easy to look at the FUL, FU, and FUR cubies and see how they
move around to perform this monoflip.

What makes a monoflip so useful is the fact that it can me commutated with
moves of the face (U) to flip two edges.  E.g.,

  FEFMFFM' U MFFM'F'E'F' U'

will flip the FU and RU edges.  (The first FEFMFFM' flips FU while messing
up the rest of the cube, then the U moves the RU to where the FU was,
then MFFM'F'E'F' flips the "new" FU as well as undoing what was done to
the rest of the cube.  U' then restores what was done.)

Commutating with other moves will, of course, allow you to flip other edges.
Using UU instead of U will flip the FU and BU edges, for instance.
If you add conjugation, you can get pretty much any two edge pieces to
flip -- e.g.,

  R' FEFMFFM' U MFFM'F'E'F' U' R

will flip the FU and RB edges.

--------

The drawback of FEFMFFM', however, is that it is not that easy to remember,
since you also have to remember its inverse MFFM'F'E'F'.  (Although the
embedded conjugate MFFM' is its own inverse, which is nice.)

Therefore, the monoflip I see more often in other people's repertoire is

  F E' F E' F E' F E' (12 moves)

which has many advantages:
 1.  It is easier to remember;
 2.  It is its own inverse;
 3.  Its results are "elegant".  (flips of FU,FL,BR,BL)

Of course, this move is special enough that you don't NEED to use it as
a monoflip if you rotate and reflect this move.  To flip two adjacent
edges, simply do

 FE'FE'FE'FE' R'ER'ER'ER'E

and you'll flip the FU and RU edges.  (The second part is just a
reflection along the BL - FR plane.)  Other variants of this move
can pretty much let you flip any combinations of edge cubies you
want.

--------------

I used to use the previous "monoflip" a lot.
The only drawback with the previous monoflip, however, is that it is
too slow, especially those slice moves.  Therefore, when I need
to do edge flipping these days, I use this monoflip:

 R F' U R' F (5 moves)

At first this doesn't look like a monoflip, since each face seems to be
pretty messed up.  But this is not your normal monoflip -- this is a
SLICE-BASED monoflip, where the E slice is intact except for the FR edge.

In fact, I'd conjecture that this is the shortest monoflip there is.  To
flip the FR edge, RUF is pretty much the quickest you can to it in.  But
this messes up two diagonally opposite edges on the slice, so at
least two more moves are needed to restore this -- hence, the F' and R'.

You can think of this as RF' conjugated with U -- I'm not sure it
helps much though.

The inverse, F' R U' F R', is just a reflection of the original move and
so is pretty easy to remember.

In any case, this makes edge flipping nice and quick:

 RF'UR'F E' F'RU'FR' E  (flips FR and FL in 12 moves)
 RF'UR'F EE F'RU'FR' EE  (flips FR and BL in 16 moves)

But how about the other edge pair combinations?  Conjugates, of course.
I use these moves:

 1. Adjacent edges, same face:

   F'R'  RF'UR'F E' F'RU'FR' E RF  which reduces a bit to:
   FFUR'F E' F'RU'FR' E RF  (flips FU and RU in 16 moves)

 2. Adjacent edges, same slice:
   (done above, 12 moves)

 3. Opposite edges:
   (done above, 16 moves)

 4. Skew edges:

   R'  RF'UR'F E' F'RU'FR' E R  which reduces a bit to:
   F'UR'F E' F'RU'FR' E R  (flips FL and RU in 14 moves)

These are the current edge flips in my repertoire, and they achieve a
balance between being easy to remember and being fast to do.

----------

I'd appreciate if others could share the moves they use for 2-edge flips, as
well as know of any results known of God's algorithm for 2-edge flips.

I concur with Marius.  I used to practice solving underwater in my swimming
pool, back when I averaged 33 seconds!  I would use a cube with just a small
amount of vaseline.  After taking the cube out and letting it dry a couple
hours, it would turn VERY WELL.  Also, the deleterious effect on the plastic
seems to be negligible, as I still have those same cubes and they still
operate smoothly some 15+ years later.

I did a quick run with my optimal solver program. Here are all maneuvers
with shortest length (face-turn metric) for the four possible two-flips.
Note that many of them are basically identical due to the symmetry of
the two-flip patterns itself:

A few remarks to my optimal solver program. Its input is the
output-textfile of my Cube Explorer program and it optimizes the
maneuvers of this textfile.

It is basically the phase1 of the Cube Explorer algorithm, but with Mike
Reid's idea of reducing the number of cube-states by symmetries it is
possible to put the whole phase1 in a pruning table of about 69MB (Mike
already did this more than a year ago in his own optimal solver
program). My optimal solver needs to generate about 20% less nodes than
Mike's when searching the tree and in this way does the search a bit
faster.

I do some more cosmetical work on the source code and then give it to
the public. The hardware requirements are about the same as for Mike's
solver, but it runs on the windows platform.

My apologies for leaving out a couple of things in my note about conjugation
and commutators.  But if I hadn't left them out, I doubt that we would have
received Dan's very nice little message about rightward and leftward
composition.

I should have mentioned the rightward vs. leftward composition issue. As Dan
points out, it is certainly the case that Y'XY can be correct in one book while
YXY' can be correct in another.  However, what I *meant* to say was that I had
seen books in which (unless I was missing something obvious) the author's
definition of conjugation did not correspond to the author's composition
direction.

All I was really trying to say was that irrespective of the author's chosen
direction, YXY' and Y'XY are both conjugates.  It's just that in one case, you
have the conjugate of X by Y and in the other you have the conjugate of X by
Y', and which is which depends on the right vs. left system the author is using.

I cited the reason "X shifted by Y" as a reason for preferring the conjugate of
X by Y to be Y'XY in the Cube-Lovers system.  I should also have mentioned the
homomorphism vs. antihomomorhism issue.  There are two reasons for preferring
Y'XY to YXY' for the conjugate of X by Y in the Cube-Lovers system, and
regrettably I only mentioned one of them.  Homomorphism is the other.

Dan covered the homomorphism issue extremely well, so I would like to make some
additional comments about the "X shifted by Y" interpretation of conjugation.

Let us suppose that we have a maneuver

    A = L2 F2 L2 U  L' R B R2 D2 R2 B' L R' U'

which flips the uf cubie and the df cubie while leaving the rest of the cube
unchanged (the rest of the cubies are said to be fixed by A). The uf and df
cubies are the edge cubies which are in the middle of the top row and the
middle of the bottom row of the front face, respectively. (The given maneuver
for A is minimal in the face turn metric, but the exact maneuver doesn't matter
for our purposes.)

Suppose that instead we want to flip the ul cubie and the df cubie.  A maneuver
which will do so is U'AU.  The U' move brings the ul cubie into the uf cubie's
place while leaving the df cubie where it was.  The A maneuver flips the
*contents* of the uf cubicle which is now the ul cubie and flips the df cubie
as usual.  The U moves returns the (now flipped) ul cubie to the ul cubicle.

We might write the actions of the A maneuver as follows:

     A:  uf ->  fu  (flips the uf cubie)
         df ->  fd  (flips the df cubie)

We might write the actions of the U  and U' moves on the edge cubies as follows:

     U:  uf ->  ul          U':  uf -> ur
         ul ->  ub               ur -> ub
         ub ->  ur               ub -> ul
         ur ->  uf               ul -> uf

Hence, if we just consider the AU part of U'AU, we have that the uf cubie goes
to fu which in turn goes to lu.  (If U performs uf -> ul, then it equivalently
performs fu -> lu).  So the uf cubie is carried to the ul cubicle and flipped
to be lu.  This is the general idea of what we want (to flip the cubie which is
in the ul cubicle), but it is the wrong cubie in the ul cubicle.  So preceding
AU by U' "cancels" the movement of the cubie (and also the movement of all the
other cubies) and retains only the flip of the cube.  The net result is that the
cubie which is flipped is shifted from being the uf cubie to being the ul cubie,
as desired.  A is shifted by U, which is what we wanted.

It should be clear that UAU' flips the ur and the df cubies.  UAU' flips the ur
rather than the uf cubie, which we can describe as saying that A has been
shifted by U'.

Essentially any two edge cubies can be flipped by variations on this basic
theme.  Our next example will involve whole cube moves.  We denote the whole
cube move of grasping the right face and turning the whole cube clockwise and
counterclockwise by c_R and c_R', respectively.  So c_R' would bring the bu and
fu cubies into the uf and df cubicles (respectively), A would flip them, and
c_R would return them to their original locations.  The net result is that the
maneuver (c_R' A c_R) flips the bu and the fu cubies.

It is standard on Cube-Lovers to denote the 24 rotations of the cube by C, and
we might write a C-conjugate as c'Ac where c is some fixed but arbitrary
element of C.  c_R and c_R' are just two particular elements of C.  Working
with a real cube, you probably wouldn't even think about C-conjugation in this
particular context  --  you would just do it.  That is, if your hands knew how
to perform the A maneuver to flip the uf and df cubies, and if you needed to
flip two edge cubies which were on opposite sides of the same face, you would
just rotate the whole cube in space to bring the two cubies which needed to be
flipped into the uf and df locations and then you would perform the A maneuver
--  simpler to do than to describe.

It is more common on Cube-Lovers to talk about M-conjugation than to talk about
C-conjugation, where M is the group of 24 rotations and 24 reflections of the
cube.  C is a subgroup of M.  So c_R and c_R' just as well elements of M as
they are of C, and our (c_R' A c_R) maneuver is a good example of
M-conjugation.  M-conjugation lets us deal with reflections in addition to
rotations, which in effect means it let's us treat clockwise and
counterclockwise moves as equivalent when appropriate for symmetry purposes.

But when we are dealing with whole cube rotations of a real cube, we are just
dealing with C-conjugation.  In the case of our A maneuver, C-conjugation means
that c'Ac lets us flip any two cubies anywhere on the cube which are opposite
edge cubies on the same face of the cube.

Finally, whole cube rotations are a convenient way to apply the maneuver A to
any face of a real cube.  But mathematically, we really do not have to perform
whole cube rotations.  We can use C-conjugation (and more generally,
M-conjugation) to apply the "same" maneuver to a different face.  Consider
again (c_R' A c_R).  If we write out A, we get

     c_R' (L2 F2 L2 U  L' R B R2 D2 R2 B' L R' U') c_R

But the maneuver (c_R c_R') is equal to the identity, so we can insert it between
each face move thusly.

    c_R' L2 (c_R c_R') F2 (c_R c_R') L2 (c_R c_R') U (c_R c_R')  etc.

Now, we can re-associate thusly so that we have the c_R-conjugate of each face
turn.

    (c_R' L2 c_R) (c_R' F2 c_R) (c_R' L2 c_R) (c_R' U c_R) etc.

Finally, if we actually perform the calculations, we discover that conjugation
by c_R leaves L, L', L2, R, R', and R2 alone; it takes F, F', and F2 to U, U',
and U2, respectively; it takes U, U', and U2 to B, B', and B2, respectively;,
it takes B, B', and B2 to D, D', and D2, respectively; and it takes D, D', and
D2 to F, F', and F2, respectively.  Hence, conjugation by r_C gives us a
maneuver to flip the bu and fu cubies thusly.

            A = L2 F2 L2 U  L' R B R2 D2 R2 B' L R' U' (flip uf and df)
   c_R' A C_R = L2 U2 L2 B  L' R D R2 F2 R2 D' L R' B' (flip bu and fu)

Hey there. I've got a problem with my Square-1 puzzle. A few days ago, I
got a whole bunch of sugar grains stuck inside which are screwing up the
mechanism big time. At first it seemed as though the it was getting better
as the sugar was ground down and flushed out during each rotation, but now
it's getting affected by the dampness and the sugar's turning into a
pretty decent adhesive. The only real solution seems to be to take the
puzzle apart, clean it, dry it, and reassemble it. Someone on rec.puzzles
suggested soaking it in water, but given that the stickers are laminated
paper instead of plastic and the possibility of rusting the mechanism, I'd
rather not do this. Besides, I'd really like to see the internal workings
of this Machiavellian torture machine. :-) If anyone on this list knows
how to disassemble/reassemble the puzzle, I'd really appreciate it if you
could let me know how to do it. :-) Thanks in advance. L8r.

 Although I'm not really sure of my info, I believe WD-40 was
originally a Water Displacer, hence "WD". Fairly sure it was meant
to displace water from mechanisms made of metal. It's possible that
its lubricating properties were secondary. As a semi-amateur
mechanical technician, I gather that it's not intended to be used as
a long-term lubricant. Used as intended, it seems to be a very good
product.

 As to compatibility with plastics, I once was cleaning the inside
of a computer printer that had a clear plastic rack which engaged a
gear on the print head drive motor (which, amazingly enough, was on
the print head itself; no kidding). I was using rubbing alcohol, as
I remember. Whether it was the alcohol itself, or an adiitive to
dilute it, I don't know, but the rack crystallized, cracked, and
fell apart in only a few minutes. Astonishing to watch.

 Alcohol is usually a safe solvent for electronic work, but
apparently not for some plastic mechanical parts! Of course, I had
knowingly ignored the warning not to use any solvents for cleaning.

 Lesson from this is that there's some risk in applying liquids of
unknown compatibility to some plastics. HDPE won't be bothered by
any liquid you're likely to apply. Silicones (not spelled "silicons")
should be safe, very likely, and Teflon powder would be. (Just don't
get that powder near a cigarette or flame; decomposition products
are very poisonous.)

I know how to disassemble it!  First you get it into the original shape that
it comes in, and turn 180 degrees.  Then you twist it about 22 degrees and
pry out one of the dart (edge) pieces.  This can best be seen in a diagram,
and I have a rough sketch at this address:

http://members.home.net/chrisandkori/sq-disassem.jpg

Once one piece is out, they all come out easily, similar to Rubik's Cube.
Putting it back together is similar-- do the same thing in reverse.  The
mechanism is really neat!

Subject: RE: Reinventing (and some edge-flipping techniques)

	I've just spent three days being a Rubik's Cube demonstrator at a trade
fair, using the method given the my Step by Step solution in the middle of the
fifth edition of my Notes.  The problems that Wei-Hwa Huang has described are
ones that I found in trying to develop an easy method.  Basically there is no
'simple' way to flip edges, where 'simple' means easily understood and
remembered.  There are simple ways to move edges, move corners and twist
corners.  Consequently I decided to get the edge orientations correct at the
beginning of work on the last face, so that I wouldn't have to worry about what
happened to the rest of the face.  In case you haven't got my notes at hand, I
used  BLUL'U'B'  which is a simple conjugate of the commutator  [L,U].  This
exchanges the four  U  corners as two pairs of exchanges and cycles three  U
edge, but effectively flips two of them on the way.  Using the inverse process
BULU'L'B'  does the same thing, but one of them effectively flips two adjacent
edges and the other flips two opposite edges.  Two applications will flip all
four edges.  Then we know simple processes which do 3-cycles or pairs of
2-cycles of edges, preserving orientation, or of corners and we have simple
processes for twisting corners.  So we could carry out these three steps in any
order giving six possible algorithms and I'm pretty sure I received examples of
all of these.  Indeed, of one considers doing the last face as having a fourth
stage of orienting edges, there are 24 possible algorithms and at one point I
was classifying algorithms into these 24 cases.  I don't think I kept up with
this long enough to have all 24 cases, but I expect all of them exist!
	Some personal comments and recollections, much of which is in my Notes.
	The ideas of monotwist and monoflip, though blindingly obvious, took
well over a year to emerge!  Despite the fact that lots of quite bright
mathematicians were working on the cube (e.g. Conway, Penrose, Rubik), I
remember first hearing about the idea in Jan 1980 (?) from Peter McMullen who
said they were using the idea at Cambridge.  At first it seemed unreasonable as
we generally were looking for moves that only affected the  U  face and the
mono-moves are almost all elsewhere.  However once I realised that the idea
gives a way of building simple moves, I realised that the commutator  [F,R]
was a mono-move in the  L  face and its square was a mono-twist in the  L
face.  The Cambridge group had been using shorter, but less simple, moves.
With these mono-moves, it was now pretty easy to build the algorithm that is my
Step by Step solution and I think I did it within a few weeks as I recall the
5th ed. of my Notes was produced by March.  (Remebering dates from 20 years
ago is always a bit dodgy - check what's in the Notes, which I don't have a
copy of here.)

On what point does the Spratt wrench fail?  That's always been my
favored edge-flipper.  (On the 3-Cube, that is; when solving a
dodecehedral puzzle I bought from Mr. Bandelow, I was forced to develop
other edge-flippers, and the one I ended up with maps easily onto the
Cube.  In 3-Cube terms, it's based on R F' R' F, which induces a
3-cycle (fr,fd,dr) on edges.  By applying this, rotating the cube 120 degrees
about its rfd-lbu long diagonal, and applying the inverse, you can get
a two-edge flipper at the price of disturbing four corners.  The
dodecahedron I solve by doing edges first with this procedure, then
using (the dodecehedral analog of) (R F' R' F) 3, which leaves edges
alone and produces two corner swaps, to fix up the corners.  But when
solving the 3-Cube, I still find the Spratt wrench more convenient.)

What I'd like is a puzzle like the dodecahedron, but with an additional
turning mode: 72 degrees on a cut through the center.  The puzzle as it stands
has face-cut lines that make it clear such turns are conceivable,
though designing a mechanism for them would be interesting.  Perhaps
when we get force-reflecting datagloves.... :-)

The game is similar/equivalent to Rubik's Eclipse. The rules are as
follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set Up:
At the beginning of the game, the board is empty. One player
takes the 8 circle pieces, and the other player takes the 8 square
pieces.

Objective:
To win the game you must get 3 of your game pieces of the same
color (black or silver) in a "locked" row, either vertically, horizontally
or diagonally. A row of 3 is "locked" when none of the game pieces
in it can be flipped onto an adjacent square, because all the
adjacent squares are occupied.

Rules of play:
Players alternate in taking turns. The Circle player starts the game
by placing a circle piece, either side up, somewhere on the board.
Subsequently, starting with the Square players's first move, each
player's turn consist of two actions: Flip and Place,  _in that order._

Flip:
On each turn, the player must flip _any_ one of their opponent's
pieces already on the board. Flipping a piece means moving it to
any adjacent vacant square (horizontally or vertically, but not
diagonally) while _reversing_ the sides. The grey becomes black
and vice versa.

Place:
Each player must, on each turn, then place one of their pieces,
either side up, on any vacant square on the board, _even if this
results in a winning line for the opponent._

Note: A player _must_ flip an opponent's piece, even if this may
result in a winning line for the opponent.

If it is not possible to flip any of their opponent's pieces, the player
still goes on to placing a piece of their own.

Play goes on in this manner, with each player first flipping any of
their opponent's pieces (not necessarily the last one placed),
before placing a piece of their own. This means once placed on the
board,, players will never touch their own pieces again, but they
can change position and color of their opponent's pieces.

A player may leave an opponent's row of 3 without loosing the
game (provided it is not "locked").

Winning the Game:
The first player to archieve a "locked" vertical, horizontal, or
diagonal line of 3 of their _own_ game pieces, all with the same
color (black or silver), is the winner. A "locked" line is one in which
none of the 3 game pieces can be flipped because all the adjacent
squares are occupied.

If the game continues until the last piece is placed on the board,
and both players end up with a winning line, or neither player has
won, the game is a draw.

When I read David Singmaster's algorithm in his Notes on Rubik's Magic
Cube I thought his idea of curing the orientations of the edge-piece
before positioning them was a great one, and adopted it in my own
algorithm.  One may be able to get away with only 6 turns to cope with
the orientation, which is quite a gain on the number of turns needed
if one takes the obvious route and orients once the pieces are in
position.

I then went on to apply the same principle to the corner pieces, by
orienting them next, which can be done in 7 or 14 face turns by
selecting the first of the following (for three twists) or the first
followed by the second suitably applied (for two or four twists):

F U2 F' U' F U' F'
L' U2 L U L' U L

These processes, which I mentioned in my last post, move the corner
pieces as well as twist them, and also move the edge pieces but
preserve their orientation.  So, if applied after the edge pieces have
been oriented but not positioned, they get the top face of the cube
the right colour, and it can then be solved by orientation-preserving
moves of the edge and corner pieces.  I may be rather bad at
perceiving patterns, but I find the simplification of having to look
only at the faces of the top-layer pieces that lie in the side faces
of the cube in order to work out what needs to go where enough of an
advantage to make this order of the stages worthwhile even if it did
not take fewer moves in total.

I'd like to return to Fred Wheeler's interesting question (30 March
1999), for its own sake and partly as a prelude to my next posting.

The processes I originally used to solve the cube - before I had been
introduced to commutators by David Singmaster's little blue book -
were based on a principle that formed itself in my head as I explored
the cube.  I called it "Out and back by a different route".  If pieces
were moved away from their original position by one process and then
restored by a different one, the result would be a process that would
only move pieces other than those moved out and back.  Then it struck
me that the different routes could be based on the obvious processes
used in a bottom-up algorithm to move a bottom corner piece into
position from the top corner vertically above it, depending on the
orientation of the piece. Thus, taking the DLF piece as the one
subject to the out-and-back movement, the out trip would take the
piece to FLU using front face turns, and the return route would bring
it back using left face turns:

F U' F'. U' L' U L  (1)

This process, I discovered, moved an edge piece out of the top layer
into the middle, UB > FL, but had no other effect on the middle layer.
So, at once, it formed the basis for solving the middle layer.

Besides inverses and reflections there is one other essentially
different process of this type involving the DLF corner.  It takes the
piece to the far corner RUB on the out trip:

F U2 F' .  U2 L' U' L  (2)

And it too moves just one edge piece out of the top into the middle
layer, from a different source position but to the same target
position as (1), UF > FL.

We can now repeat this approach, using these two processes and their
inverses and reflections to take a piece out of the top layer and then
return it.  That generates a set of upper-layer processes that led me
to my first solution.  It was not very efficient, but one of these
process is very attractive.  It results from following (2) above with
the reflection of (1) in the diagonal plane FL-BR:

F U2 F' U2 L' U' L  . L' U  L U F U' F'    =  F U2 F' U' F U' F' (3)

It is short, because of the cancellation, very easy to do, because all
the turning can be done with one hand, and has a very useful cycle
pattern, with an untwisted 3-cycle of edge pieces and a twisting pair
of swaps of corner pieces.

That leads on to another basic technique: looking at the cycle pattern
of a process and seeing what can be done to suppress or simplify some
of the cycles.

If we take (3) above, by combining it with its reflection suitably
applied, we can suppress either the movement of the edge pieces to
give a double twist of the corners (4), or the movement of the corner
pieces to give an untwisted edge 3-cycle (5):

F U2 F' U' F U' F' B' U2 B U B' U B UF(L-, R+) (4)
F U2 F' U' F U' F' L' U2 L U L' U L U(F, L, R) (5)

There are shorter alternatives, of course, but (4) remains my
favourite for the purpose, done as

  F U2 F' U' F U' F' [twist whole cube parallel to U'] L' U2 L U L' U
L

Of course, taking powers of a process is one way selectively to
eliminate constituent cycles, and (1) above, if done four times, is a
triple corner twist, because the edge pieces move through a 4-cycle
which is eliminated, one corner piece undergo a twist with no change
of position, which is preserved, and the other two undergo a twisted
2-cycle that leaves them in position but twisted.  But powers tend to
be rather lengthy, as this example illustrates.

Then one can look for patterns in processes and apply them elsewhere.
(3) above can be thought of as taking DLF up to the top and then round
and home again, with the + and - turns of the F face cancelling out.
One other process I discovered on the cube using this principle is the
following, where M is the turn of the centre slice parallel to R:

M2 U M2 U2 M U M2  (UF,UB) (UR, UL) (6)

And the structure of (3) transfers directly to the tetrahedron as

F U F' U F U F' 3-cycle round the vertical axis

and the dodecahedron as

F U2 F' U' F U' F' and  F U2 F' U F U2 F' edge 3-cycles + corner
double-swaps

In these I am taking the puzzle to be sitting on a table, with U being
the vertex (for the tetrahedron) or face (for the dodecahedron) at the
top and F being a vertex or face adjacent to the top pointing towards
you.

For a discussion of designing 3-cycles using commutators and
conjugates, see the message I posted in November 1997, which looked at
processes of the type

[P, TQT']

where P and Q are turns of layers that are parallel to one another,
and T is a turn of a layer transverse to P and Q.   These processes
yield a result that can be expressed as second-level commutation, as
mentioned by David Singmaster.

I would prefer that there is no preview time. Solving the cube isn't just 
turning the faces, it's also deciding which faces to turn. Surely, time spent 
in examining the cube is therefore part of the solving time.

Subject: Algorithm for the Antislice Group
Date: 4 May 1999 14:11:57 GMT
Organization: California Institute of Technology, Pasadena
Message-Id: <7gmv7d$ncj@gap.cco.caltech.edu>

In a small fit of playing around last week, I finally worked out a
method of solving the Antislice Group.

Of course, God's Algorithm is known, but since it's pretty hard for
me to memorize it, here's mine.

For those of you that don't know, the antislice group is all
configurations that the cube can be in, provided that the only
move you make is FB, with rotations and reflections.

So, with fixed centers, the only allowed moves are FB, RL, and UD.
I'll abbreviate these to F, R, and U.   I'll even use the "clockwise
quarter turn" metric, which means that F' = FFF is three moves, not one.

Okay.  The algorithm has four steps:
 A.  Get the cube to be a subset of the half-face turn group.
      (up to 4 moves)
 B.  Match the corners.
      (up to 6 moves)
 C.  "HOt HOt HOt" (double-slice group).
      (up to 12 moves)
 D.  Solve the cube.
      (up to 6 moves)

This is a maximum of 28 moves.  In practice, one can often avoid future
extra moves by modifying the algorithm slightly.

A.  Get the cube to be a subset of the half-face turn group.

  This means that the UD faces only contain the UD colors, the FB faces
  only contain the FB colors, and the RL faces only contain the RL colors.
  Here's how to do it:

 A0.  Pick any set of colors on opposite face centers.  Let's call it the
  color "grud".  (For instance, if blue is opposite white on the solved cube,
  "grud" can mean "blue or white".)  We'll try to solve "grud" first.
 A1.  Find a face with grud at the corners and reorient the cube
  so that it is the U face.
 A2.  If the U center is grud but none of the U edges are grud, perform
  R, repeat step A1, and go to step A5.
 A3.  If the U center is not grud but all of the U edges are grud, then
  either the F center is grud or the R center is grud.  If the F center is
  grud, perform F; if the R center is grud, perform R.  Then repeat step
  A1 and go to step A5.
 A4.  If the U center is grud and two of the U edges are grud (so there
  is a grud "H" shape on the U side), then either F has two grud edges or
  R has two grud edges.  If the former, perform F; if the latter, perform R.
  Then repeat step A1 and go to step A6.
 A5.  If the U center is not grud, two of the U edges are grud, and
  every face has some grud on it, perform U and go to step A7.
 A6.  If the U center is not grud and none of the U edges are grud,
  either the F center is grud or the R center is grud.  If the F center is
  grud, perform F; if the R center is grud, perform R.  Then repeat step
  A1 and go to step A7.
 A7.  If the U center is not grud, two of the U edges are grud, and
  either F or R does not have grud on it, then perform F or R (whichever
  one did not have grud on it), repeat step A1, and go to step A8.
 A8.  The U face should now be all grud.  If the other four faces are
  "unsolved" (have colors of adjacent faces), perform U and it should
  be solved.

B.  Match the corners.

 In other words, does each face have four corners of the same color?  If so,
 go on to step C.  Otherwise, at least one face will have four corners of
 the same color.  Orient the cube so that it is the U face, and
 then perform FRFRFR.  This should match the corners.

C.  "HOt HOt HOt" (double-slice group)

 This step is to get rid of any face that looks like an "H" (all one color
 except for two opposite edges), an "O" (all one color except for the
 center), or a "t" (all one color except for the corners).  This may
 have to be done up to three times, and after they are removed
 the cube should be in the double-slice group.

 Orient the cube so that the top face is "HOt".  Then, perform FRRF.
 Repeat until no faces are "HOt".

D.  Solve the cube.

 The cube should now be in a very easy to solve state, if not already solved
 already.  If the cube is not already solved, there must be some
 corner which does not match an edge next to it.  Orient the cube so
 that said corner is the UFR corner and the edge is the RU edge.  Then,
 perform FF.  Repeat until the cube is solved.

Hello all,

I just want to say thanks to all the great help & advice everyone has
given me.  I wish I had time to E-mail everyone personally.  I'm so glad
I found out about this mailing list & all of the great web pages.  (Yay
internet!)  You have helped me reach my goal of beating the 30 second
barrier.

It all started w/ a little book fair where I picked up "The Simple
Solution to Rubik's Cube" by James G. Nourse for $.25 last year.  It
then snowballed, and I learned everything I could about the cube, spent
tons of money on different puzzles, & put a lot of time into it.  After
the first 4 months of intense cubing, my records are:

LAYER METHOD
30" best
36" average

CORNERS FIRST
26" best
37" average

I've been on a break for a while now ever since my hands started to
hurt.  Already I've started to loose my edge, & forgot some of the
moves.  I'm slower now, but I can still solve it under 45" guaranteed.
When the summer comes, school will be over and I'll have more free time
to train again  & hopefully reach my new goal of consistently finishing
under 30".  For now I'll give my hands a well deserved rest.

I just bought that book for a quarter on a whim.  Who knew a little cube
would have such a great impact in my life.  Thanks again for all of the
support.

I finished my optimal solver program for Windows now. It optimizes the

I am quite satisfied with the performance. I searches 1,100,000 nodes
per second on a P350. 90MB of RAM should be enough (though I run it on a
machine with 256MB). A depth 17 search on random cubes typically takes
less than one hour. I made a test run with 10 random cubes and optimal

and 4 had lenght 17).

Subject: "Negative" Turning
Message-Id: <11000-3733527C-9578@postoffice-123.bryant.webtv.net>

When the cube locks up on me, I have to turn the layer in the opposite
of the desired direction anywhere from a little jiggle to over 90 degrees in
order to straighten out the pieces.  I'm sure all of you have to do this
too.  I'm calling it "negative" turning.  Is there another term for
this?  I do this rather unconsciously now.

All this locking up wastes time, especially with numerous unsuccessful
efforts.  I'm guessing when fractions of seconds count, time spent
fixing could be spent doing more turns.

I'm wondering, do any of you perform negative turning before starting
any turns to prevent a lock up before it starts rather than try and fix
it after it happens?  Or do you incorporate these negative movements
within combos in anticipation of frequent sticky situations?  When
practicing frequently used combos I have incorporated negative turns
into them with some success.  Does anyone do this to all moves?  It
would take a long time to achieve this w/ all of my combos, so I'm
looking for someone who has.  Would it take longer to do combos w/
negative moves "built in", or just fix the problem when in comes.  Or
maybe there is someone out there who makes turns so accurately he never
experiences this.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: "Negative" Turning
References: <11000-3733527C-9578@postoffice-123.bryant.webtv.net>

The reason that "negative turning" is necessary is because the prior
turn did not get the faces lined up exactly.  Let's look at the sequence
"R U".  You turn the right face a quarter turn, then you turn the upper
face a quarter turn.  If you make the R turn a fraction of inch too far,
then the cube will correct itself when you try to make the U turn.  But
if you make the R turn a fraction of an inch too short, the upper face
will lock if you first try to turn it clockwise.  The "negative turn"
doesn't lock up because it is counterclockwise.  When you then start to
turn the U face counterclockwise it straightens up the R face so that
the U face is free to turn in either direction.

"Negative turning" is sometimes necessary, but a better solution is to
always either overturn or underturn by a fraction of an inch depending
on which way you plan on making the next turn.  So if you are planning
on turning "R U", make sure your "R" is a fraction of an inch past a
quarter turn, but if you are planning to turn "R U'", make sure your "R"
is a fraction of an inch short of a quarter turn.

	I am having problems with this step.  My cube is in a

                YYY
		YYG  <- Back face
		GGG

	    BBW ORO BBW ROR
	    BBB ROR WWW ORO  <- Bottom face
	    BWW ORO BWW ROR

		YYY
		YGG  <- Front face
		GGG


	FRFRFR does not solve the corners for this position.

Sorry to say (because it's no longer made), the Deluxe Cube from
Ideal had differently-shaped details inside so that with moderate
amounts of misalignment, it would self-align as you began a move. It
also had plastic colored tiles attached.

"Negative" turning seemed to be unnecessary if you used ordinary
care, but I wasn't trying for speed.

Message-Id: <000301bea112$904d7070$3cca8018@octopod.ne.mediaone.net>

I recently bought a rubik's cube from someone.  It was in a blue cardboard
box that has Hungarian all over it.  The closest thing to a logo says:
"Politoys" and under that it reads: Hungary Budapest.  On one side of the
box there is a long three paragraph description which I can't read and it's
signed by E. Rubik.

When I opened it up I found a cube that looks in every way identical to the
Ideal version of the rubik's cube.  Same colors.  Same "Rubik's cube" logo
in the center white square.

Does anyone know if this is, in fact, a very early version of the cube or
did someone put an Ideal cube in this box?  What was the first and original
cube?  The guy who sold it to me is also very curious.  Could it be that
Ideal took over and this is a later production that was begin sold in
Hungary?  I'm wondering then why there is no indication of "Ideal" anywhere
on it.

The cube is most likely the original Rubik's cube made in Hungary by Politoys
in the early 80's.  I bought many of those being in Czechoslovakia during the 80's.
Basically two types wrapped in a blue cardboard box were sold.
The first one has opposite colors w-y, g-b, r-o and it tends to fall apart after a
few months of speed cubing. A positive thing is that this type is well suited for
speed cubing, it doesn't require perfect aligning of cubicles. A negative thing is
that stickers don't last long, the glue is bad.
The second type has colors w-b, g-y, r-o, I think.  I always changed stickers to
get w-y oposite colors. There was a very slight difference between cardboard boxes.
This cube requires better aligning of layers before a next move (the construction
was a little bit improved), the glue is better, but the plastic used I rate lower.

It is one of a series of three that are on sale in the UK in the
cheaper toy shops.  They were mentioned on Cube-lovers in March.

The big one that you have works pretty well and makes a handsome
display object.  There is also a normal-sized cube also with tiles
that is about the most horrible to turn I have ever met - the
shop-keeper even felt compelled to warn of the fact me in advance.
Then there is also a key-ring sized cube (30 cm) which turns tolerably
well and has conventional stickers, though not firmly stuck on, for
only 73 pence in my local shop.  Apparently the children like them
because they are so easy to solve by rearranging the stickers.

The most problematic ones I've come across so far are the "Wisdom" Ball
(everything has to be lined up exactly right), Alexander's Star (same),
and the Pyramorphix (same). It's a neat puzzle, but it seems to have a
mind of its own, many times forcing you to turn a half/direction you don't
want to and gets jammed constantly. When you finally do get past the jams,
it's completely unexpected and flies at super speed. On top of this, the
centres are so sharp that when it happens, it often cuts your fingers. Has
anyone managed to come up with a fix for this? My guess is all that would
need to be done to fix all of these problems would be to make the edges of
the centre pieces more rounded, but I can't be sure about that.

Gene Johannsen sent in a reply agreeing that he had probably made a
twisto in scrambling the cube. The moderator did not forward that
reply to the group, hoping instead to determine a sure answer to the
question.  I'm sorry if the delay has cast doubt on Wei-Hwa Huang's
antislice algorithm (which I have not examined in detail).

The problem is actually fairly difficult if we want a definitive
answer for any antislice-group position--Singmaster (p. 54) despairs
of presenting Morwen B. Thistlethwaite's analysis of the antislice
group, settling instead for an outline.  I must admit that I have not
yet found a complete answer that can be carried out by hand.  However,
I have a method that will recognize positions in a group four times
the size of the antislice group, and that is good enough to weed out
almost all of the near misses.  In fact, a simpler method that will
detect positions in a group 972 times the size of the antislice group
is sufficient for the case in question.

As in Singmaster we consider a corner-based representation.  That is
to say, we keep the BLD corner from moving, and perform an antislice
as a half-turn of the F, T, or R face together with a quarter-turn of
the adjacent center-slice.  [ For newcomers, I'll mention that my use
of "T" for "Top" instead of "U" for "Up" is an intentional preference;
see 22 Feb 90 and 28 Oct 94 in the archives for an explanation. ]

In this representation the face centers form a movable part of the
cube.  We could represent their position as a permutation of the six
face centers, but it is more convenient to represent them as a
permutation of the four major diagonals of the enclosing cube, as Jim
Saxe and I did for the Tartan cube (16 February 1981).  We may label
the faces and diagonal-endpoints as follows:

     Z---X
     | B |
 Z---W---Y---X---Z
 | L | T | R | D |
 Y---X---Z---W---Y
     | F |
     Y---W

The T antislice acts on the face centers as (F,L,B,R) and on the
diagonals as (W,Y,Z,X).  Similarly, the R antislice induces the face
permutation (T,B,D,F) and the diagonal permutation (W,Z,Y,X). The F
antislice induces the permutations (L,T,R,D) and (W,Y,X,Z).  In the
following, I will use note the diagonal permutations.

In addition to the face centers, there are three orbits of edge cubies
and two orbits of corner cubies (ignoring BLD).  The corner
orientation never changes, and reorientation of edges is applied to an
entire orbit at a time.  I label the edges and corners as follows:

         [Z]--Z3--Xp
          |       |
          Z2  B   Y2
          |       |
 [Z]--Z2--Wp--Y3--Y---Y2--Xp--Z3-[Z]
  |       |       |       |       |
  Z1  L   X1  T   Y1  R   W1  D   Z1
  |       |       |       |       |
  Yp--X2--X---X3--Zp--W2--W---W3--Yp
          |       |
          X2  F   W2
          |       |
          Yp--W3--W

The diagonals W-Wp, X-Xp, Y-Yp, and Z-Zp are labeled Wc, Xc, Yc, and
Zc, respectively, for the purpose of recording the face center
position.  In addition I label the orientation of the edge orbits as
P1, P2, and P3, where P1^2 = P2^2 = P3^2 = I.  (These could be
represented as permutations of 2-sets, but that seems unnecessary).

So the three antislices are:

    Fa = (W,X)(Yp,Zp) (W1,Z1,X1,Y1) (W2,X2) (W3,X3) P1 (Wc,Yc,Xc,Zc),
    Ta = (X,Y)(Wp,Zp) (X1,Y1) (W2,X2,Z2,Y2) (X3,Y3) P2 (Wc,Yc,Zc,Xc),
    Ra = (W,Y)(Xp,Zp) (W1,Y1) (W2,Y2) (W3,X3,Y3,Z3) P3 (Wc,Zc,Yc,Xc).

         corner perm   edge perm                    ori  center perm

It is immediately apparent that each antislice is an odd permutation
of each orbit of corners, of each orbit of edges, and of the center
diagonals. In addition, the number of Pi orientations is changed by
one on each antislice.  Thus we expect to see each of these seven
parities agree in any position of the antislice group.

Gene Johannsen's position (after replacing color letters with position
letters) is

        BBB
        BBF  <- Back face
        FFF

    LLR TDT LLR DTD
    LLL DTD RRR TDT  <- Down face
    LRR TDT LRR DTD

        BBB
        BFF  <- Front face
        FFF

which is represented as

    (X,Y) (Wp,Zp) (W1,Y1)(X1,Z1) (X2,Y2) (W3,Y3,Z3,X3)

in the corner-based representation.  Here the permutations on the
corner orbits and two of the edge orbits is odd.  But the
{W1,X1,Y1,Z1} orbit has an even permutation and the orientation and
center positions are the identity, of even parity.  So the position
cannot be in the antislice group.

I noticed that the difference could conceivably be caused by a single
error, say an F-slice move:

  Fs = (W1,Z1,X1,Y1) (Wc,Yc,Xc,Zc) P1,

and with a short program in GAP I was able to find the following
single-error process for Gene's position:

    Fa Ta Fs Fa Ta' Fa Ra^2.

Now I'll apologize to anyone whose head is reeling, and invite anyone
who's game to join in a little bit of slightly tougher group theory.
This will show you how far I've been able to analyze the antislice
group, and the part that remains mysterious.

Note that the parity constraints above allow:

    6 permutations of {W,X,Y},
    24 permutations of {Wp,Xp,Yp,Zp},
    24 permutations each of {W1,X1,Y1,Z1}, {W2,X2,Y2,Z2}, and {W2,X2,Y2,Z2},
    8 subsets of {P1,P2,P3}, and
    24 permutations of {Wc,Xc,Yc,Zc},

with a parity constraint on the seven components that reduces the
number by 2^6, for

    6 * 8 * 24^5 / 64 = 5971968

possible positions.  Singmaster notes that the actual size of the
antislice group is 6144 = 5971968 / 972 positions.  Clearly there are
more constraints at work than permutation parity.  Most of them are
due to life in a certain quotient group.  The group S4 of permutations
on four letters contains a normal subgroup consisting of the identity
plus the three pairs of two-cycles:

    H = { (), (W,X)(Y,Z), (W,Y)(X,Z), (W,Z)(X,Y) }.

The quotient S4/H then has six elements, and is isomorphic to S3.  We
can see this explicitly by writing down the blocks of S4/H:

   Block 0      Block 1    Block 2    Block 3    Block 4    Block 5

   ()           (W,X,Y)    (W,Y,X)    (W,X)      (W,Y)      (X,Y)
   (W,X)(Y,Z)   (W,Y,Z)    (W,Z,Y)    (Y,Z)      (X,Z)      (W,Z)
   (W,Y)(X,Z)   (W,Z,X)    (W,X,Z)    (W,Y,X,Z)  (W,X,Y,Z)  (W,X,Z,Y)
   (W,Z)(X,Y)   (X,Z,Y)    (X,Y,Z)    (W,Z,X,Y)  (W,X,Y,X)  (W,Y,Z,X)

The top line of each block shows the element of S3=S({W,X,Y})
corresponding to the block.  Note how easy it is to recognize the
blocks 3, 4, and 5:

    If you have a four-cycles, use one two-cycle from its square;
    If you have a two-cycle containing Z, use the disjoint two-cycle.

This procedure will yield the S3 representative from these blocks.

Now remember the antislices?

    Fa = (W,X)(Yp,Zp) (W1,Z1,X1,Y1) (W2,X2) (W3,X3) P1 (Wc,Yc,Xc,Zc),
    Ta = (X,Y)(Wp,Zp) (X1,Y1) (W2,X2,Z2,Y2) (X3,Y3) P2 (Wc,Yc,Zc,Xc),
    Ra = (W,Y)(Xp,Zp) (W1,Y1) (W2,Y2) (W3,X3,Y3,Z3) P3 (Wc,Zc,Yc,Xc).

Ignoring the orientation component, we see that the action of every
component of Fa is from block 3, every component of Ta from block 4,
and every component of Ra from block 5.  So for every position in
< Fa, Ta, Ra >, each permutation orbit will be in the same block, and
the orientation component must still agree in parity.  So instead
dividing by 2^6, we divide by 6^5 2 = 15552, for

    6 * 8 * 24^5 / 15552 = 24576

positions, which is only four times the size of the actual antislice
group.

The factor of four arises if we fix all but the {Wp,Xp,Yp,Zp} and
{Wc,Xc,Yc,Zc} orbits.  There are only four possibilities for the last
two orbits, rather than the sixteen that my analysis provides.  (As
Singmaster notes, when the other components are the identity, the four
possibilities consist of SOLVED and the four Zigzag/Laughter
patterns).  Unfortunately, I have not found any way to describe the
correspondence between these components in general, to make the
analysis exact.

Quote: "I want RubXML files to be able to hold move sequences instead of
puzzle configurations. I will add this option after I study the
notations currently in use."

I think both ways of specifying a cube configuration are important. You
can only specify a cube configuration in move sequences if you know the
exact move sequence you used to mess it up.

Move sequences are probably more useful for storing solutions to cube
configurations. Also, Lars Petrus has a cube tutorial that shows you how
to do each step by scripting a Java applet to rotate the cube according
to stored sequences. (Sure, his "lightweight" applet would not want to
drag in a whole XML parser, but the use is there)

BTW, here is one way to specify move sequences:

<sequence name="twist3corners">
R'U'RU'R'U2R
</sequence>

If you want something flexible, how about:

<sequence name="foo">
	RURU
	<useseqence name="bar" orientation="000" direction="backwards"
reflect="x">
	U'R'U'R
</sequence>

where:

usesequence imports another sequence
orientation is a 3D coordinate (is there a better way to specify this?)
direction is which direction to execute the sequence
reflect is the axis over which the sequence should be reflected.

It's flexible but I don't ask me if it's useful :-)

	Following on from my mail
of the 21st May...

	I have defined a language for writing
down the state of a standard Rubik's cube.
Many people offered suggestions, and I thank
them.

	The language now has its own website:

	http://byrden.com/rubxml/

which contains an online demo program to
read the language and draw the corresponding
cube in "unfolded" format. People who want
to record their "pretty patterns" may find this a
useful resource!

I have one question that I want to ask now. This
language needs a "default colour scheme". I
understand that one way of colouring a Rubik's
Cube was much more common than the others,
but I don't know which one. Can anyone specify it
exactly for me?

The most common color scheme was
 White opposite Blue,
 Green opposite Yellow,
 Red opposite Orange.
 If you hold Yellow as Front and Red as Up, then Blue is Right.

Color "purists" have complained about this, preferring
 White opposite Yellow,
 Blue opposite Green,
 Red opposite Orange.
 -- note that each pair is the same color except for some "Yellow" added.

[Moderator's note: You say white opposite blue was common, but when
 was that?  My experience and other reports lead me to believe that
 what you call the "purist" color scheme was most common in 1985 (viz
 _Rubik's_Cubic_Compendium_) and I don't recall seeing any change
 since.  It also is reportedly most common in the chirality you
 describe, which is called the BOY version because blue, orange, and
 yellow appear in that order clockwise around a corner.  The mirror
 image coloring is called YOB (a Cockney term for a yokel).  I don't
 know of any cute naming schemes for the enantiomorphs in color
 schemes in which the blue, orange, and yellow faces do not all
 meet--Dan ]

Hi, Friends!

The original color schema is (designed by Erno Rubik, and it is written in
Rubik's: The Magic Cube book also): blue is opposite to green, white is
opposite to yellow and red is opposite to orange. The differerence between
each opposite colour-pair is yellow: blue + yellow = green, red + yellow =
orange and white + yellow = (guess it! :-).  If blue is on the top and red
is in front of you, yellow is on the right side.

I'm going by what I have observed -- which is mostly Ideal cubes.  The
Ideal Deluxe cube has white opposite blue, as well as their Revenge
and the three normal cubes I have in my collection.  I can check the
orientation of the minicubes in Rubik's Race and the "deluxe-ish"
cube supplied with Rubik's Game.

The 5x5x5 in my collection is also white opposite blue, although it
isn't Ideal (pun intended).

The OddzOn cubes are also blue opposite white, so I think it's safe
to say that the majority of cubes out there are blue opposite white.

 From http://www.rubiks.com/cubesolution_new.html :

	Hey! I just thought I'd drop a line to introduce myself since I've
subscribed to your mailing list. My name is Brian Davis (my friends all
call me "_pink". The underscore is silent.) I live in Athens, Georgia USA
and Manage a Computer Graphics Facility at the Univ of Georgia.
	I have been a cube fanatic since day one... I've got a pretty good
collection and several volumes of notes (as I sure most of you do) but feel
there is still more out there. I have noticed many names here on the Cube
Lovers List that have some wonderful www pages. Maybe I'll find some time
to create a www cube presence of my own that doesn't overlap too much.
(this might be hard to do as you guys have it pretty well wrapped up right
now...)
	I have "e-talked" with Tim Browne some previously (don't blame him
for me being here, he's innocent really) and when I found he was here and
the list seems to still be alive I thought I might as well subscribe.
	I'll start out by sticking my neck out a bit and see if any one
wants to hear some information I have about Square 1 moves or
inner-workings (since I've crushed a few out of curiosity and could take
picts to post on the web) or the mechanics of the Skewb since I've had to
put it back together after an employee dropped it.
	At any rate, I'm glad to be here and will try not to ramble so
incoherently in the future.

Hello again,
	Thanks to all who sent me a welcoming note.

A few notes of interest:

Dale: Crazy 5 combined cubes man! I might have to try it... Did you also
attach the edge cubes or just the corners?

Chris (or Chris and Kori): I've been to your page(s) many times. Nice site!
I've been to ebay a bit but I'm not giving out my ebay nickname... ;) I
have the Pyramorphix and am not sold on the last pict of my wanted page
being one in scrambled state...

Jared: Thanks for the tip. I'll follow up and let you know what turns up.

Bob Harris: Hey! another Georgian! Glad to see I'm not the only one. I'm

Noel: If you are talking about the octagonal prism then the answer is just
like the 3x3x3 but if you're talking about the Octahedron (double pyramid)
then unfortunately I cannot help as I have not had the chance to hold one
in my hands...

Hana: Thank you for the wonderful note. I have not had a chance to visit
your site but it will be first on my list when I get home. I am intrigued
to see what you have been doing!

Pete Beck: Did the money order I sent ever arrive? The beachball is a Skewb
of 4 colors (thus the subclass) I contacted Meffert's a few weeks back and
they informed me that the beachball is not in production but they are going
to make more available in October! I have found info on the bandaged cube
but need clearer direction as to which pairs of cubies are 'glued'
together... As for Unknown #2 on my wanted page, when tracing the
dissections I can only imagine a 2x2x2 with non cubed cubies... Who knows...

Others inquired about my Square 1 and Skewb notes. Ok. I'll do a write up
on each under two different posts as to keep things separated. Posts to
follow...

Thanks again to all for making me feel at home.

Subject: Skewb notes

Ok, while Meffert's site has the solution posted, there still seems to be
some confusion about how this thing is actually made. Well I found out
first hand when one of my employees dropped my skewb on a concrete floor. I
have plans to take picts of the disassembled skewb and post it online but
until I get around to it here's a description.

The Skewb consists of:

6 Square center pieces that have small tabs on 2 opposite undersides.
4 Pyramid shaped corners with a triangular tab on its interior side.
1 4-armed spider mechanism with 4 corner pieces (described above)
	attached to the end of each arm.

To understand the arrangement of the spider mech refer to the diagram below:

      A _____________________
       /|                   /|B
      / |                  / |
     /  |                 /  |
    /   |              A /   |
  B/____________________/    |
   |    |               |    |
   |    |               |    |
   |    |      x        |    |
   |    |               |    |
   |    |B              |    |
   |    |_______________|____|A
   |   /                |   /
   |  /                 |  /
   | /                 B| /
  A|/___________________|/

	If you connect each corner marked "A" with the "x" (with the x
being the exact center of the cube) you will have the spider mechanism. The
corners marked "B" are only attached by the various tabs on each piece.
	Skewbs are EASY to disassemble if you know how...

1.) Rotate any dissection of your skewb 60 deg so that 2 centers are
aligned edge to edge.

2.) Place a thin bladed screwdriver between the common edge of any 2 edge
pieces and gently wiggle applying increasing pressure.

3.) Catch all the pieces as it crumbles in your hands.

Putting it back together is interresting and certainly was when my employee
dropped mine but after you do it it's kinda neat.

1.) Align the colors of 2 corners on the spider and insert the center of
the corresponding color so that the tabs hold it in place.

2.) Align the corners and place 2 more center sections. Slight rotation of
one corner helps at times.

3.) Insert the proper loose corners being sure to orient each correctly.

4.) Place one edge tab of the last center into position and snap into
place. I have found it easiest to put the skewb on the table with the last
center on top and firmly press it into place.

	Meffert's puzzle ball series are the same mechanism but some are
supergroup puzzles because of the center orientations. The Meffert
Beachball is IMO a subgroup because of only having 4 colors.
	I hope this has been of value for someone and isn't just a waste of
bitspace for all.

I find it interesting to think that the internal mechanism for the skewb
and the puzzle balls are the same as for the pyraminx, but that the pieces
stuffed into the gaps make it a completely different puzzle.

Hello, I wonder if anyone can help me.  I allowed a friend of mine to
play with my pyramorphix and it broke in his hands.  One of the inner
pieces broke apart.  It was the piece that sits on the dowel with four
little rods sticking up.  Does anyone know if any local (USA) shop fixes
this particular puzzle?  Does Meffert's Puzzle & Games fix them in Hong
Kong?  (I'd prefer a local shop)  Does anyone have a broken pyramorphix
they would sell me a piece to replace mine?  :-)   Thanks for any help.
(Is Meffert the inventor of the pyramorphix?)

Subject: Solution for the size 2 octahedron
Date: Thu, 1 Jul 1999 17:48:12 -0400
Message-Id: <000001bec441$c8879680$29f5ddce@laptop>

After playing with the size 2 corner moves based octahedron, I found that
the solution for most of the edges is trivial, just a matter of putting them
into place using standard puzzle moves.  The only part of the puzzle that
needs a special move is the final step that you may be left with a pair of
faces that need to be switched:

The following represent a tip of the octahedron, and sides A and B must be
switched

     R->
     |
_____|______
     |
  A  |  B


The following move accomplishes this:

Down
Rotate Counterclockwise
Up
Rotate Twice
Down
Rotate Twice
Up
Rotate Twice
Down
Rotate Clockwise

The "Up" and "Down" moves refer to the right half of the octahedron, cut
through the middle of the tip and leaving the left half steady.  The Rotate
moves refer to rotating the tip in place.

Anyone with a good notation for this and the size 3 corners based
octahedron, or the side based size 2 or 3 octrahedra let me know.

[Moderator's note: Isn't a corners-based octahedron just a face-based cube
 with the corners flattened and the faces made pointy?  I think BFTDLR or
 BFUDLR would work for notation. --Dan]

To my fellow cube-lovers:

Josef Jelinek and I have made a web page devoted to the cube. He
contributed cube solution algorithms, accompanied by graphics and I
contributed 12 of my 3-dimensional designs, many of them recent. That
means they were constructed after my book was published in 1997. I also
sketch another problem resulting from these designs, that of fractals.
You may find all this in our URL: http://cube.misto.cz.

Any comments, criticism, etc would be appreciated. I still did not get
my question answered, either by you or by the search engines. It is
this: Is there anyone, on or off the web, who has created something
similar to what I have done? I know about the people at Wunderland, and
have seen thir work; however, what I have done is different.

Thank you very much for any input you can provide.

Subject: Square 1 Notes

Greetings to all,

	Ok, I've been extreeeeeemely busy as of late but I did find a few
mins at lunch today to throw together some of my notes on the Square 1
puzzle.
	First my standard disclaimers:

1.) The web page design and layout for getting the Square 1 back to cube
shape have been stolen directly from Christian Eggermont. My notes were
very similar but I liked his presentation much better than mine. The only
thing I have done to his notes was to rearrange the classification of
shapes as to their 'distance' from cube shape. To see his original work
please refer to:

http://web.inter.nl.net/C.Eggermont/

2.) I expanded on Andrew Arensburger's cube preserving formulas and also
adopted his piece notation system. To see his original work please refer to:

http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~arensb/Square1/

3.) Some formula were revised and expanded upon from Richard Snyder's
Square 1 Solution Book. Nice book but sometimes a bit cryptic.

4.) I know that there has to be some errors in my notes. If you find them
please advise me so that I might make the corrections necessary. (Actually
now that I think about it, I believe that in the Edge moves section there
is a mistake where I say to turn the bottom 30deg in one direction but it
would make an impossible Right turn... if you see this just turn the bottom
the other direction... I'll try to find it and correct it asap)

5.) There are 2 or 3 pages of blank diagrams or unfinished notes that
indavertantly got included. Please disregard anything that looks unusual...
(hopefully that won't be every page you look at...) ;)

	Ok, so if you're not asleep by now you can hit

http://128.192.40.238/pink/SquareList.html

for the shapes list as to get from where you are now back to cube shape.
There is a link at the bottom of that page to 3 PDF files. One to
manipulate Corners, one for Edges and one for my initial thoughts on 2x2x2
cycling of Square 1 quadrants. I hope there is some info of use for
somebody.
	And as always... feedback is very welcome.

later all,
_pink

Have any of you done any work on solving the cube with computer programs
using procedural languages such as C? I've seen books on the manual methods
of solving the cube (with the cube in your hand) such as David Singmaster's
texts but haven't seen any publications regarding computer solutions using
procedural languages.

Do you have any suggestions you can pass my way? I am a good programmer but
not a cube solution expert. I am just a novice at best when it comes to cube
algorithms and efficient cube solutions.

I am attempting to work on a project involving solving the cube
programmatically and also planning on doing analysis/comparisons of various
algorithms to solve it. Any help, suggested methods, advice, tables,
algorithms, etc. that you may be able to provide me would be very greatly
appreciated.  I can think of a number of ways to approach this task but
would also like some of your folks expertise as well.  I am having trouble
getting going in the right direction.

Also what is the theoretical least number of plane movements that are
required to solve the cube no matter what its configuration and why?

You can reply directly to me.

Thanks in advance,

Message-Id: <NDBBLHBJOLNCAMMDPAPACENPCAAA.ck1@home.com>

I recently saw one of the original Ideal Perpetual Calendar cubes sell on
EBAY for over $100 US dollars!  I decided it would be cheaper and more fun
to try and make my own.  Based on photos I have collected, I've tried to
reconstruct the original sticker scheme.  This turned out to be quite a fun
puzzle by itself, since there are only a few ways it can be done.  For
example, by a lucky coincidence, there just happen to be exactly the right
number of sides for the middle letters of the months (P, O, C, A, E, and U).

I did a quick scan of the cube-lovers archives to see if anyone had posted
the sticker scheme before.  I found nothing.  I was wondering if anyone who
still has their calendar cube could post either a detailed description, or
even photos from a few different angles.

My own homemade version can be seen here:

http://www.chrisandkori.com/calendarcube.htm

I just printed out the stickers I needed on paper, then cut and scotch-taped
them to a "blank" cube.  I plan to make a somewhat higher-quality version
with real stickers once I nail down the original Ideal sticker
configuration.

Thanks to anyone who can help!

Hi all,

Has anybody even built (or throught about building) a device 
which physically solves a cube? Something like a combination 
of a vision system to recognize the colors, a 'robot arm'
which can perform the rotations and a computer to solve the 
mathematics and to operate the robot arm.

I'm currently thinking about making such a system, so I'm 
interested if anybody else has done something similar.

Greetings,

Hi,

I'm currently working on my MSc dissertation on this topic. I'm
working in Java to build a Cube to which I can then apply algorithms
in Singmaster Notation. The approach I'm taking is to use an
incremental breadth first search to generate a library of
"interesting" macro moves (Richard Korf did some work on this a few
years ago).  I would then like to use a heuristic approach with the
macro moves to head towards the solution. Currently I am thinking of
using a version of the Manhattan distance but I would be grateful for
any other heuristic suggestions.

I would also be interested in a reply to Paul's question about the
least number of theoretical plane moves.

Best Regards,
Colin Waters,
Department of Computing
Imperial College, London.

[Moderator's note:  What is a "plane" move?  All cube metrics count a
 quarter-turn of a face as a single move.  Some also include a
 half-turn of a face.  Some also include a quarter-turn of a center
 slice, or perhaps also a half-turn of a center slice.  I've not seen
 anyone count an antislice move as a single move, though it seems
 fairly reasonable to me, since it's fairly easy to do with one motion
 of the wrist.  In fact, we might even include moves such as "F^2 B"
 under the rubric of "plane moves", so that there would be 45 generators.

 My recollection is that you may find fairly good bounds in the
 archives for the first two metrics--say a ratio of 3:2 or less--but
 not for the others. --Dan ]

Chris,

You may want to look at www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/CustomCubes.html for 
some more information about making a custom cube.  Kristin also owns a 
French calendar cube, if I remember correctly, but I imagine that if you 
have successfully made a calendar cube that you don't really need to know 
how hers works.

	In response to Chris Pelley's message about a Rubik's Calender Cube, I
would like to say that I made one, although it may not be identical to the
one that Rubik manufactured. (I thought up the idea before I knew one had
been made commercially) I just mapped the letters and numbers out on paper
and then printed out all the characters I'd need with my printer and
affixed them to a blank cube.
I really lucked out because the scotch tape I had was exactly the same
width as the width of one cubie! I also used an exacto knife so I could affix
multiple characters at once, then cut between the cubies with the knife.
An example of how the date reads is:
 J U L
   2 8
19 9 9

The 19 (and 20 once we get there) are on one cubie.

I've attached a jpg of how I arranged all the characters. I make 
no guarantees that is works, but I'm pretty sure it does.
Sorry to those of you who can't receive files. I would have made the
drawing ASCII, but I can't make upside or sideways characters =(
In the drawing there may be some discrepancy between O the letter and zero.
The 'thinner' one is zero. As you can see, my cube is still on Jul 27. I
haven't changed it yet since yesterday.

[Moderator's note: I don't send binary attachments out on this list.
 However, I was able to decode Corey's picture, and here's a diagram.
 The characters ^ > v and < denote symbols that are rotated 0, 90,
 180, or 270 degrees clockwise, respectively.

             N^ .. ..

             O< 4> Mv

 I believe the corner marked 0< should be 0^.  The cube only goes
 through 2001, though the addition of 2< on the blank corner would add
 another year.

This is what my Rubik's Calendar looks like (use a non-proportional
typeface).  The date is as I took it out of the box, from which I
deduce I last played with it in 1982, since I certainly haven't
touched it this decade. Curiously enough, it will be correct again
this year.

The digits in the lower right corners  of the cells indicate the
orientation in quarter turns from the vertical as shown in the
diagram.  But the orientations can be worked out anyway for all except
the centre pieces, because of the requirement to be the right way up
on the face showing the date.

You wouldn't believe how long ago it was that I attempted a computer
based cube solution.  At the time, I had become adept at assembly
languague for the chip in the Apple II and I worked in that.  Today I
would typically use C++.At the time, I had not found Singmasters book
( the time was roughly 25 years ago) and when I did, I realized that
what I was attempting was doomed, so I quit.  I was attempting to
apply the tree search techniques used for Chess programs to look far
ahead and by applying a heuristic scoring method, find likely paths to
solution, which would in turn be iterated.  In the process, I worked
ways to encode the orientation of each cubelet, its postion, and
transformation rules for moves etc.  As soon as I read Singmaster, I
realized how deep the iterations would have to go to reach a
convergent solution.  That's when I dropped the problem.  Some of the
recent work which the moderator referenced have moved the state of the
art further, but not yet so far as to search and find solutions in a
general sense.  (If that statement is false, it will be worth the
embarassment, if only the critic sends me a URL for source code.)

I do have some suggestions about format and linguistic conventions.
For an example,go to http://www.ggw.org/donorware/4D_Rubik/ and look
at the source code.  Yes, that's really all there is.  If that helps
or you think I should add a few comment lines, let me know.

I have finished the last touches on JPuzzler, the Java port for Puzzler for
Windows.  Many people with other operating systems asked if I was going to
port the program and well, this is it.

Speed is an issue.  The program runs very well on a PPro200 or better, but I
believe the video card that is used makes the biggest difference because on
a PII-300 with a basic video card the program ran slower.

JPuzzler was written in 100% pure Java so it should work on any Java
compatible browser but for now it has only been tested on Netscape 4.5+ and
Internet Explorer 4+.  I don't have access to other hardware, so I am
particularly interested in hearing from players with Macintosh computers, or
any flavour of XWindows.

All 17 puzzles from Puzzler are implemented and I will probably add more in
the future; suggestions and criticism are welcome.

Subject: Notes on the Bandaged Cube... combinations and other musings.
In-Reply-To: <v04003a09b3a0062a6a87@[128.192.40.243]>

I just picked up a bandaged cube the other day, and I get the feeling that
this might be one of the few puzzles which would beat even the Square-1
for solving difficulty. For those of you who haven't seen this nightmare
of a cube, Hendrik Haak has a picture of it in the museum section of his
Puzzle Shop (he calls it a "Bicube"). After playing around with it for a
bit, I figured I'd try and work out the number of possible combinations.
The cube is constructed from a standard Rubik's Cube mechanism, so all the
standard Rubik's Cube restrictions apply here.
The cube is made up of 13 pieces. One of them is created by fusing an edge
piece between 2 centres, effectively turning it into a 2x2 piece. Because
of this piece, 2 axes of motion are effectively cut off permanently,
making a maximum of 4 axes of rotation. There are 4 pieces which are made
up by fusing an edge to a centre, 7 pieces are a corner/edge fusion,
leaving us with one standard corner piece. These fusions make the puzzle
much more difficult than it first appears, as the contortions of all of
these 1x2 pieces effectively block axes of rotation which were easily
accessible only a quarter turn ago, sometimes getting so bad as to make
the only available axis the one you just turned, in some extreme cases
even forcing you to back out following exactly the same path you used to
enter the current state. Needless to say, this makes solving the puzzle
very frustrating indeed. Anyhoo, back to the combinations...
Two of the centres are effectively locked into place for all time, leaving
us with 4 edge/centre fusions which can be rotated one of 4 ways, giving
us a factor of 4^4 combinations. Piece rotations in place are impossible.
The first potential restriction would be creating more than one area where
only the corner cube could fit, but the 2x2 piece makes this an
impossibility. The second would be potential collisions between pieces.
There are 5 pairs of adjacent sides where you have a 1:16 chance of a
conflict, and 2 ways of creating a double conflict, so we reduce this
amount by 5*256/16-2=82, leaving us with 174 possible arrangements of the
edge/centre fusions.
The edge/corner fusions and the lone corner piece will be handled
together. The corner piece can be placed into any one of 8 corner slots,
while the edge/corner fusions fit tightly into the remaining slots
surrounding it, giving us a factor of 8!=40,320 combinations. Now for the
restrictions... let's start with a simple swap first. Let's take an
example side. Like numbers in the table are bandaged together.

112
345
345

Would it be possible to swap piece 1 and piece 3? Given the restrictions
carried over from the Rubik's Cube, the only way you can swap a pair of
edges or a pair of corners is if you also swap either a second pair of the
same type, or a pair of its opposite. To see this latter case, rotate a
slice of a solved cube 90 degrees either way and then "reconstruct" it
using your favourite patterns. God's Algorithm in this case is expressly
prohibited. Since the corners and edges are fused, a swap of one expressly
implies a swap of the other, so this is OK.
How about swapping pieces 3 and 5? This one's a bit more difficult. Not
only are you swapping the pieces, but you're rotating them as well. When
you swap these 2, both edge pieces are inverted, maintaining the even
parity, so that's OK... the corner half of piece 3 is given a positive
rotation, while the corner half of piece 5 is given a negative rotation.
Modulo 3 parity is maintained, so this is also OK, meaning the whole swap
is OK. Swapping any 2 edge/corner fusions on the cube can be broken down
into a compound movement of either of these, so any of these pieces can be
swapped with any other similar piece without restriction.
The second potential restriction happens with edge/centre fusions. In
certain special cases, the centres can rotate in such a way they they box
in a 1x1x1 area, limiting it to 1 possible place. This can happen in one
of two possible ways, bringing our combinations from 174x40,320 down to
172x40,320 + 2x5,040.
The final possible restriction happens when we swap an edge/centre fusion
with an edge/corner fusion. What happpens when we swap pieces 4 and 5? So
you don't have to scroll back, here it is again...

122       122
345  -->  344  ?
345       355

There are 3 problems with this: 1) you're swapping a single pair of edge
pieces, 2) you're flipping a single edge piece, and 3) You're rotating a
single corner in place, *all* of which are definite no-no's on the Rubik's
Cube, either solo or in any combination, so you definitely can't do it
here. The corner rotation can be accounted for easily enough by rotating
the 1x1x1 piece in place to compensate, which you've probably noticed that
I conveniently left out of all calculations to this point, to save
multiplying and dividing by 3 unnecessarily. ALL of these problems can be
compensated for by either simply not doing it, or by doing the same thing
with another set, giving us 2 pairs of swapped edges and 2 edges flipped,
compensating for the corner rotation again with the 1x1x1. This
effectively slashes the potential combinations in half, bringing us down
to 86x40,320 + 1x5,040 = (86x8+1)x5,040 = 689 x 5,040 =

    5040

Most puzzles of this type are difficult because of the sheer number of
combinations. This is perhaps the only one of this type which is so
difficult because of its limits. If you want to take it apart and put it
back together randomly, you've got a 1 in 6 1/1920th chance of doing so
correctly, perhaps this puzzle's one advantage over the cube. However, if
you want to tough it out and devise a pattern for it, then you'll need to
work out 172x8+2 = 1,378 patterns to get it back to its default shape,
followed by at least 6 more patterns to restore the edge/corner fusions to
their proper positions, making at least 1,384 patterns to work out for a
general solution. I've graciously decided to leave this as an exercise for
the reader. ;-) L8r.

My new 5x5x5 cube arrived a few days ago [took it 8 weeks to be delivered
'cos I was too cheap to get air-mail], and I have a couple of questions
pertaining to it:

Does anyone know a [reasonably] simple move to swap two edge pieces [the ones
on the very edge, not the center and not the corner] around?

Also, does anyone know of an equivalent to the Cube Explorer or anything like
it that can do 5x5x5 cubes?

Thank-you very much,

Being a legacy-software addict, I use Lynx (2.8.2dev22) with a shell
account, so I haven't seen the images yet, but this seems to be even
more desirable than the very-nice, discontinued Ideal DeLuxe Cube.

Let's hope that it self-aligns as well as, or better than, the Ideal
I mentioned.

Actually, that's been around for well over a year now... He has, however,
just recently undergone a major change on his site, including adding a
museum section with lots of really twisted puzzles. Anyone on this list
who checks it out should get a plastic keyboard cover to avoid its
shorting out due to the inevitable salivation. A few notables to check out
are the Skewb Diamond, the Extended Cube, the Mushroom, and the Rubik's
Revenge Special. If anyone can tell me how this is constructed, I'd really
like to know about it.

Is the octaeder the Magic Octohedron, or the Cuboctohedron? I placed
several puzzles on order with him over a month ago, but he only shipped
them out some time last week as there were several he didn't have in
stock. Apparently, once they're shipped they take about 6 weeks to reach
North America, unless you expedite the service. I asked him about it, but
he just kept telling me "$19 for surface mail". :-/

> Has anyone

I've placed the Dogic on order... it looks especially nightmarish, but
everyone I've heard from who's tried it claimed it was really easy to
solve. Given that it's a superset of the Impossiball, I'd think it would
be particularly painful. I guess I'll find out once it arrives. The
Mozaika I haven't seen yet, but it doesn't look all that difficult... Then
again, I also thought that including a hint book with the Square-1 was an
insult to the intelligence and that anyone with as much experience as I
had with Rubik's Cube and similar puzzles should have no problem with it
before I found out just how wrong I was (it took over a year for me to
solve it once), so who's to say? For the other two... if you mean the
"Octagon barrel", it's basically a Rubik's Cube subset, The Magic
Octahedron can be solved as 2 Pyraminxen slammed back to back, and the
Cuboctohedron, being no more than a Rubik's Cube with huge chunks sliced
out of it, would be solved the same way. As for pictures showing puzzles
in mid twist, the only site I'm aware of with pictures like that would be
Chris and Kori's page. L8r.

Dear Gary

Sorry to hear that you had to wait 8 weeks for your Prof. cube to arrive.
So here is some good news for Cube Lovers. We are offering free
Airmail Postage for all of our puzzles ordered during the Summer Holidays.
I would also like to announce our New PUZZLER CHALLENGE of the Month
competition.  Starting with the 3x3x3 cube and Orbix which can be played
both with mouse or SpaceOrb.
The fasted time in each category, puzzle plus mouse or SpaceOrb receives
a free puzzle of their choice.  There will be a different Puzzle each month.
See: http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/JPuzzler/challenge.html
You can practice on line at:
http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/JPuzzler/JPuzzler.html

For all cube lovers that do not have a SpaceOrb and would like one, we have
arranged a special deal with Spacetec who will ship the SpaceOrbs ordered
directly by UPS, at the Special Price of US$45.00 including free delivery in
the USA & Canada, add US$16.00 for all other countries, see our Puzzle Shop.

I will be announcing the start of the "Mind Sports Olympiad 2000, Puzzle
Championships soon.  There will be great prizes, puzzles must be played both
online as well as the real thing.  The finals will be held August 19 - 27
the Year 2,000 in the National Hall at Olympia in London UK, which has
9,000 square meters of floor space (approx 100,000 square feet).
Something very spectacular is being planned for the millennium year. We
intend to smash the record for the largest number of entries at any
Olympiad ever, which currently stands at 10,744 for the Olympic Games in
Atlanta 1996. This will be achieved by having a number of "biggest ever"
tournaments including the Puzzle Championships within the Mind Sports
Olympiad.

HAPPY PUZZLING TO ALL

Subject: repairing broken cubes

I recently broke one of the face cubies of my 4X4.  I attempted to
repair it by drilling a hole for a pin and gluing it together (it broke
in the "ankle" that holds the "foot" to the top.)  I tried several
different types of glues and epoxies and nothing seemed to stick very
well.  I finally used some woodworkers glue and it is holding together
for now.  I'm being very carefull and cannot do any fast moves with it.
Does anyone know of a better way to repair these types of breaks.  I
would not have attempted the repair at all if the cubes were still
readily available, but since they are out of production I have little
choice.  This is the second 4X4 I've broken in this manner.

I don't, but for 3x3x3, I use software: Cube Explorer by H.Kociemba
http://home.t-online.de/home/kociemba/cube.htm

Here are some move sequences I get:

* D L2 B2 F2 R2 U' L2 . F L2 B2 R F2 D' U R2 B L2 R2 B R2  (20 moves)
* U2 F' L2 B D2 B F' U2 . R' B D R' F' L R U' F' L2 R U'  (20 moves)

Just apply them on an already-solved cube.
