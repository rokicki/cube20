It was a little better than 100 tapes.  It was roughly 20GB of data.  I
stored 14 bytes per position (could have done it in 13 bytes, but I stored
the lengths with each permutation).  Each "position" was really a
representative of an equivalence class of M-conjugates (usually)
containing 48 elements.  Hence, it took about 14/48 bytes (about 2.33
bits) to store each position.  This isn't too shabby, but it is nowhere as
compact as the coding scheme discussed in the "How Big is Big?" thread.

A 24q process is known for superflip.  It is known that superflip is
greater than 19f.  Is a 20f process known for superflip?
