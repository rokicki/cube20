If I may be permitted a slightly off subject posting ....

Much materal is now online (such as Cube-Lovers) that was never online
before, and much of the online material is being cited in research and
other papers.  I just ran across the best source I have seen for how to
cite such material -- http://www.taft.cc.ca.us/www/tc/tceng/mla.html. 

Since Cube-Lovers is E-mail and archives of E-mail, here is an excerpt 
that addresses citations for E-mail:
