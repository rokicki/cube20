Two hundred thousand elements is on the edge?  Even assuming an
extremely noncompact representation of 20 bytes each (one per
non-center cubie), that's only four megabytes.  The _smallest_ RAM load
I have at home (never mind the machines I have access to at work) is 8
megs, and one machine has 28.  Keeping such a list entirely in-core
would be no problem at all.  Nowhere near the edge.

But Jerry Bryan knows what he's talking about too well to make this
simple a blunder.  Could some kind soul explain what I've obviously
missed?
