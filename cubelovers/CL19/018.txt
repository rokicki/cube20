Subject: Resolution of the cube

My son has dug out my cube and has a burning interest in it now.  Also, he
has revived my interest in it.  My question is, is there somewhere I can get
the solution for him?  I would take a mailing address, printed copy or even
an old E-mail message.  My son is 13 and quite anxious to work on it and
solve it.

Thanks,
