Hi, I'm on the cube-lovers mailing list.

Bloody Hell! If someone had told me what a square-1 was, I would have been 
able to help with that query. I know the puzzle as "Super Cubix" which was 
written on the side of the 'cube'. I solved this puzzle about six months ago 
and in the same way as Ron Modest did.

Have you tried the Masterball? It is solved in a very similar way, but there 
again it does have very similar properties (having to rotate in one 
direction by pi, but any other multiple in the rest). The Masterball has a 
web site (http://wsd.com/masterball) in which it claims to be unique because 
there are no fixed segments. I once borrowed a 4x4x4 Rubik's Revenge from a 
friend, and it appeared to have no fixed segments. I believe the Masterball 
to be a different puzzle, but with similar internal workings. What do you 
lot think?

p.s. I'm sure this is a common question, but I have many 3x3x3, and one 
5x5x5, can I still get a 4x4x4 anywhere? would anyone consider selling one 
to me?

p.p.s. I'm in London.
