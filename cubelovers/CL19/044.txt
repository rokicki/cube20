I'm not familiar with Square-1...but if, as seems lkely, it's a square
that you have to get into some arrangement, then consider turning the
whole puzzle 90 or 180 degrees and trying again; that may introduce an
odd permutation and thus make a solution possible.  Or depending on the
definition of "solved" - as I say, I don't know the puzzle - maybe go
for a mirror-reflected state.
