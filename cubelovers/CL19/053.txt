I know that I have at least some of the parts from at least one broken 
Rubik's Revenge lying around somewhere.  I would suspect that I am not 
alone.  I was wondering if we could satisfy a small portion of the people 
that do not have such a beast merely by pooling our resources, and 
building whole puzzles out of the remains of old ones?  So--I'll check to 
see what I can find, and anyone that likewise has RR carcasses that they 
wouldn't mind donating to such a purpose, mail me.  Let's see what we can 
pull off!
