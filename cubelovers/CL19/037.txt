No, its more like "Light's Out", on a sphere.  It's a nice puzzle
(although the first one I bought had a broken button, so I had to
exchange it.)  It cost about $20 at Toys-R-Us.  The surface of the
sphere has 12 lights/buttons, dodecahedrally arranged.  When you push
one, in the first puzzle, the 6 surrounding lights change their parity
- if they're on, they go out and vice versa.  The goal is to get all
the lights on, after some random starting pattern.  

The other puzzles have a different combination of which lights go on
when you press a light: I think the second turns out the 6 on the
opposite side from the one pressed, and only do so if the pressed
light was orignally off (or something like that).  Obviously, I
haven't had time to study the details much yet.

The puzzle feels nice, looks good, and should be worth the $20.
