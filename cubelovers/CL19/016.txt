Subject: Welcome to the future of the Internet

As those of you who have been reading Cube-Lovers for the last few months
are well aware, we have been suffering through (almost) weekly
advertisements sent by some nutcase trying to sell magazines.  In the past,
I have been able to defeat unwanted advertising on Cube-Lovers by simply
having a chat with the advertiser (or his postmaster).  But the magazine
guy is determined to send a weekly copy of his advertisement to every
mailing list in the world, despite all objections -- there's really no way
to shut him off short of some form of mailing list moderation.
 
So we're forced to make Cube-Lovers a moderated mailing list.  Starting
with this message, every message sent to Cube-Lovers will be screened
before it gets distributed to the rest of you.  For the moment, some of the
steps in the screening process are manual, so there may be a delay before a
message you submit gets out to the rest of the list.  That's the price we
pay to keep Cube-Lovers from becoming a conduit that delivers more
advertising than content.
