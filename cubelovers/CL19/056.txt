Subject: Re: building a Rubik's Revenge

I think this is a good idea.  I don't have any parts to offer, but if anyone
has a spare centre piece with an orange sticker lying around, I could REALLY
use it.   I only have one 4x4x4, and that one piece is broken.  Please
e-mail me if you can help me out on this.
