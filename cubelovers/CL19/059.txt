There are many resources on the World Wide Web for people who enjoy 
puzzles, and in particular cube-style puzzles.

There is a puzzle dealer based in the United States named "Puzzletts" 
that advertises on the WWW at http://www.puzzletts.com.  Among other 
things in their inventory, they carry what I assume are new 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 
and 5x5x5 cubes.  I haven't compared their prices to other distributors 
yet, but they appear to have a *very* large puzzle inventory.

Other cube dealers can likely be located on the page at:

    http://sdg.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~mag/Misc/CubeSources.html

which is where I learned of Puzzletts.  Another good page for cube 
resources and information is:

    http://www.student.informatik.th-darmstadt.de/~schubart/rc_resources.html

I was excited to learn that cubes can still be purchased at at least a 
few retail sources, and with any luck the inventories of these sources will
endure a few more years.

I hope this information has been useful!
