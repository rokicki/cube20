Hi
 
My new X-Windows puzzles are out again.  Here's a brief description:
  5.2
    Puzzles now can change size dynamically.  Puzzles for the most
      part have no maximum size.  For example, you can have a 10x10x10
      Rubik's cube.
    Saved format has changed on most puzzles, should be more
      understandable.
    Drag and drop on a face to move pieces now works on all puzzles.
    Lesstif-0.36 works OK with all puzzles.  Lesstif still has many
      bugs but I have only seen cosmetic and bugs with radio buttons and
      sliders using the puzzles.
    Lots of minor bug fixes and minor improvements.
 
 
  MS Windows, port in progress, E-Mail author if interested
    They are still free and source code is still included. :)
    The best puzzles will be converted last, since they are more complicated.
    (xabacus -> wabacus: port complete (not a puzzle))
    xcubes -> wcubes: port complete
    xtriangles -> wtriangl: port in progress
 
Cheers,
