there was never any response to this, but i'll give my solution anyway.

let  X  =  U2 F R' F2 R F2 R F2 R' F U2 .

then  X  produces two two-cycles of corner-edge pairs.  the commutator
[ X , C_UFR ]  produces "cube in a cube" in 22 face / 32 quarter turns
and only turns the faces  U, F  and  R.

the notation  C_UFR  refers to a rotation of the whole cube, and
[ a, b ]  denotes the commutator  a b a^-1 b^-1 .
