Subject: Square-1 question

Hi...

I recently got a hold of a Square-1 puzzle and have been trying to solve it.
I can get to the point where it's done, but two edges on one side are
swapped.  How do I swap them back?  Is this a parity problem?  Every move I
have that swaps edges does TWO pairs are a time, so I can't get there with
what I have.  Or can I?  Any help would be appreciated.

-Aaron
