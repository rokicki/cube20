it should be possible to write a good searching program for this
subgroup.  use the filtration

              <U, F, R> ,  <U, F2, R2> ,  <>

(which is just the last two stages of the three stage filtration i
gave on may 22, 1992), and a kociemba-type searching method.
i don't know if it will be feasible to find optimal paths, but
this technique should get pretty close.

let us know what you find out!
