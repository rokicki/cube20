Here's an easy example:

Hamiltonian Circuit for < u2, r2 >
12 elements, 12 moves in group to reach each element

         Identity
         /    \
    1.  u2    r2  12.
        |      |
    2.  r2    u2  11.
        |      |
    3.  u2    r2  10.
        |      |
    4.  r2    u2  9.
        |      |
    5.  u2    r2  8.
        |      |
    6.  r2    u2  7.
         \   /
         Antipode

Position at  6. is the antipode
Position at 12. is the identity

Also, I seem to remember that the slice-squared group had 8 elements,
and if you graphed a route through the elements it formed a cube.
After drawing such a graph it is not hard to find a hamiltonian
circuit (using the edges of the cube as a pathway).

This may be true in general for all the platonic solids.
(I need to re-check "Regular Polytopes" by Coxeter).

So we have 2 examples and no counter-examples of the general graph
theory Mike mentions.
