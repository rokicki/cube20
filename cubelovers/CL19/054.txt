Seibu and Hakuhinkan used to have them too.  But the distributor took them
off the market last year and they are no longer available.  (This is 4x4x4.)

Indeed Dr. Bandelow is the designer and source of much of this stuff.
Ask for his catalog, which is in English.

The best puzzle store now in Tokyo is Moebius, between Ichigaya and Kudanshita
subway stations.  They have one 5x5x5 in stock at the moment, though it
traversed through Taiwan on its way here.  They also just got in a bunch of
stuff from Jean-Claude Constantin (but unfortunately no more transformations
of Rubik-style shapes).
