As is often the case, there is nothing new under the sun.  I believe that
the "new" idea I was suggesting is very similar to, or perhaps identical
with, certain aspects (or all) of Shamir's algorithm.  The best references
I have found in the archives are as follows: 

   Alan Bawden     27 May 87  Shamir's talk really was about how to 
                              solve the cube!
