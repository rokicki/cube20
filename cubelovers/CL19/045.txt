The quick answer is, yes, in spite of appearances you are actually very far
from finished.

A quick hint is attached below.  (This is only a hint in that it's been two
or three years since I worked with a Square One.  At that time I kept notes
and was going to write up a complete solution but I don't think I ever got
around to doing it [Alan?  Do you remember?]  If I can find those, or can
remember more complete details --time to get the Sq1 back out-- I'll pass
along more details.]

Hint:  You're right that you need to swap two pairs together.  The issue
here is that you need to simultaneously swap a pair of edges (the
triangular pieces) and a pair of corners (the quadrilaterals).  And, yes,
you can actually do this. ;-)

In short, in this state the corners only _appear_ to be in the correct
locations.

An analoguous case can occur on the 4X cube where the cube appears to be
_almost_ complete except that two edge peices are flipped.  Again, it looks
like you're close to done, but more accurately you're almost completely
diametrically "across the space of solutions".
