I am working on an engine to search optimal paths for < U, F, R > but
it's not done yet. It's certainly within the bounds of computibility:

Size (u_f_r) = 170,659,735,142,400 (hmmm, 170 trillion maybe not!)

Brilliant.

Although harder to remember, X + ( X * C_UFR) will do.

   U2 F1 R3 F2 R1 F2 R1 F2 R3 F1 U2
   F2 R1 U3 R2 U1 R2 U1 R2 U3 R1 F2        (22 f, 32 q)
