From your point of view, this change should be completely invisible (beyond
the improved content and increased latency).  It is still the case that you
should address all submissions to Cube-Lovers@AI.MIT.EDU and all
administrative correspondence to Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU.

There are some other advantages to the new scheme beyond filtering out
advertising:

  1.  Filtering out other inappropriate messages, such as misdirected
      subscription requests.

  2.  Better handling of mailer bounce messages.  This change should almost
      entirely eliminate cases where you submit a message to Cube-Lovers
      and some mailer sends you an error report.  Almost all such messages
      should now be routed correctly to me.  (Of course, mailers will still
      sometimes screw up -- please forward any mailer errors you -do- get
      back to me.)

  3.  Less messages like this one.

  4.  For the moment, the archive at ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/cube-lovers
      continues to accumulate the un-filtered messages.  But eventually, I
      hope to keep it free of trash as well.

If this message is delivered smoothly, it should be followed by two more
messages that arrived while I was debugging this stuff.  And you will
-never- see the magazine advertisement that was submitted last weekend!
