Another problem is that the center pieces are held in place by a foot 
with a rather thin "leg".  My RR died three days after I finally worked 
out a solution.  One of the center pieces lost its foot, and the rest 
of the cube simply dissolved.

I'll have to look to see how much of the cube I can still collect 
together.  Hopefully, I'd be able to donate a central ball in good 
shape, plus perhaps up to 55 pieces (if I can find them all).  Or I'd 
be willing to accept the pieces I'm missing to resurect my RR.
