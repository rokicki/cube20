>>It's got to be all edges flipped in place.

Oops. Well I figured if all edges flipped was one of the hardest
know cube states that in the case of edges-only it would be the
antipode. I'm now sure (I think) that it is really:

       all edges flipped + 4 X
(with the 4 X on sides F, R, B, L which should match Dan's diagram)

Hmmmm, I don't know if this is a standard form of representation,
but this picture looks like a folded out cube:

               + T +                        + F +
               T   T                        R   L
               + T +                        + B +

        + L +  + F +  + R +          + D +  + D +  + D +
        L   L  F   F  R   R    =>    F   B  R   L  B   F
        + L +  + F +  + R +          + T +  + T +  + T +

               + D +                        + B +
               D   D                        R   L
               + D +                        + F +

               + B +                        + T +
               B   B           --------->   R   L
               + B +           |            + D +
                               |

                             + D +
In my program I would have   L   R  on the screen for the bottom face.
                             + T +

The idea is you are always looking at a cube face head-on (just to
clarify the difference in diagrams).

I'd still like to see the process for all-edges-flipped (not
caring about the centres or corners). So "level" is the number of moves
required to solve the position? That means edges flipped in place
can be done in 12 qtw.
