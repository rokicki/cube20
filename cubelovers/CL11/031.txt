My method is essentially the same as yours - I have several intermediate
tables which cut down the processing required within the innermost loop. I
tried the same for 10*10 but it was taking eons. I tried making tables of
2*2 arrangements and solving for 5*5 of these(thereby solving the original
10*10, but the number of 2*2 arrangements makes the problem intractable on
my measly little computer. I even trie putting together all possible 5*5
solutions and assembling them in the 10*10 pattern, but the number of 5*5
solutions with the 100 tiles is in millions!
Do you have any further insight?
