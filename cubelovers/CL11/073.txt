Will be sent separately  (and yes, I would like to see yours too!)

When you limit yourself to 4 ropes with 4 colours, you always get 24 pieces,
and when you want to build a puzzle of 25 pieces, you will have to duplicate
one, which causes (a).
Using 5 colours instead, creates a set of 120 pieces, from which you could
probably pick 25 pieces (without duplication) which would satisfy both (a)
and (b), and probably 4 such sets could be found to satisfy (c) as well,
but such a puzzle would be less attractive, because the choice of 25 from
120 is somewhat arbitrary, and a puzzler would probably be more inclined
to use all 120 pieces... Of course it is all a matter of taste.
