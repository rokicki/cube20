Subject: Skewb, 5x5x5 cubes available

I've been watching all the discussion here, and I thought some people on this
list might appreciate knowing that 5x5x5 Rubik's Cubes and the Skewb are
available from Ishi Press International.  We also have hundreds of other
mechanical puzzles.

If you would like to be on our puzzle e-mail list, write us.  If you would
like a color catalog of our puzzles, send us your snail-mail address.

I apologize for intruding with a commercial message, but it did seem to me
that at least a few people on this list would like to get their hands on
some of these puzzles, and I don't know of any other distributor for these
two items.
