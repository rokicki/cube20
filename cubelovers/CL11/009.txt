Indeed.  I spoke too quickly when I said the antipodal was simply
Start with the edges flipped.  I stared at it, flipped the edges in
my mind, and it "looked" solved, so I assumed it was Start.

I am not yet for sure what they look like, but of the other two states
with order-24 equivalence classes, one is at level 9 and the other
is at level 12.  Since the only one at an even level is at level 12,
I am assuming that will be the one which is Start with the edges all
flipped.  The one at level 9 will probably be the mirror image of Start.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
