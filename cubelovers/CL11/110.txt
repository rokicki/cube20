Duh, yeah; that never occurred to me.

Yes.  I think this may be possible, too...consider a normal 3-Cube, and
restrict yourself to R, U, and F turns.  Then ignore the center and
edge cubies - the ones that get invisibilized.  You're left with a
2-Cube.  Three edge cubies never move with respect to the center cubies
or the corner cubie they surround; glue those together.  Presto!

The same treatment is not possible for making a 4-Cube out of a 5-Cube,
but an alternative occurs to me, that I *think* will work for higher
cubes: key three of the (invisible) center cubies to the center
six-pronged piece, so that they can't turn.  Then half the face turns
will cause the invisible center slice to turn with them; non-face
slices (which don't exist on the 2/3-Cube) work normally.

I notice with this construction for (say) a 4-Cube, the puzzle core
turns whenever certain face slices do.  With the 4-Cube I owned (and
presumably still own, if I could find it), the puzzle core turns
whenever certain next-to-center slices do.  I suspect the latter would
make for a smoother-turning puzzle.  Perhaps someone will someday build
a 5-Cube-turned-4-Cube and this can be determined.

In the (IMO unlikely) event I originated any of the above ideas, I
hereby place it/them in the public domain.  Go wild, Ishi Press. :-)
