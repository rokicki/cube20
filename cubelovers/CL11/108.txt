Subject:   Number of M-Conjugate Classes for GC\M

On 4 December 1993, I posted results from a breadth-first exhaustive
search of GC\M, the corners of the 3x3x3, reduced by M-conjugation.
The posting included a summary of how many conjugate classes there
were at each level of the search tree (i.e., distance from Start).

It occurred to me that I had not also posted a summary of M-conjugates
for the corners of the 3x3x3 by the size of the conjugate classes.  I
searched my records, only to discover that I had never calculated
such sizes.  If I had, I probably would have been forced to analyze
properly the distinction between M-conjugation and B-conjugation,
because B-conjugation makes no sense for the corners of the 3x3x3.
B-conjugation *can* be performed for the corners of the 3x3x3, but you
end up with the 2x2x2 instead because B-conjugation effectively
removes the centers.

Anyway, I have now calculated M-conjugate class sizes for GC\M via
computer search, and here are the results.

                         8       33
                        12      301
                        16      104
                        24     9064
                        48  1832428

                     Total  1841970

Notice that with M-conjugation, the maximum class is size is 48,
rather than 1152 as it is with B-conjugation.  Hence, my posting
of 4 December 1993 incorrectly identified the results as being
for "1152 fold symmetry".  The results are correct, but they
should be labeled as being for "48 fold symmetry", i.e., for
M-conjugation rather than for B-conjugation.

In calculating M-conjugate class sizes for GC\M, I did not "start
from scratch".  Rather, I used the existing results for B-conjugate
classes as a base.  In the case of B-conjugate classes of order
1152, no calculations are required.  Each such B-class can simply
be partitioned into 24 M-classes of order 48.  Hence, I had to
perform calculations for less than 4% of the B-classes.  Here is
a summary matrix, showing for each B-class size the number of
each M-class size which are derived.

The first row of the matrix exemplifies the process of calculating
M-Class sizes from B-Class sizes.  In the case of corners, there
is only one B-class of order 24, namely Start.  The 24 elements of
the B-class are the 24 elements of the form Ic, where c is in C,
the 24 rotations of the cube.  Under B-conjugation, these 24
elements are equivalent  (i.e., in a centerless cube such as the
2x2x2, the 24 rotations of I are indistinguishable).  But in a cube
with centers, such as the corners of the 3x3x3, the 24 elements
are not equivalent.

For example, the M-class of order 1 is {I}.  One of the M-classes
of order 6 is {FB', UD', RL', LR', BF', DU'}.  The M-class of order 3
is {FFB'B', RRL'L', UUD'D'}.  That's as many as I can do in my head,
but I think the pattern is clear.

M-classes are a partition of the B-classes.
In the case of B-classes of order 1152, the partition is regular  --
i.e., you get exactly 24 M-classes of order 48.  However, all
partitions are not regular.  In the partition of the B-class of I
which we just discussed, there is 1 M-class of order 1, 1 M-class
of order 3, 2 M-classes of order 6, and 1 M-class of order 8, for
a total of 24 M-classes.  Many other partitions are not regular,
as well.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
