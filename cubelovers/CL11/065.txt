There is quite a bit of confusion about this.  When permutation
groups are considered; even text-books do not agree.  When A and P
are permutations you can find both that P A means: apply P first, A next,
but also: apply A first, P next.  (The first meaning comes from the pure
group theorists, the second meaning more from the algebra inclined.)

Sorry to confuse the issue, but when I read such texts I have always to
think hard to get at the intended meaning.  I think the functional
notation is much clearer and leads to less confusion.

Of course, doing notations for cube rotations the group theorists
notation is applied, but when doing abstract operations...
