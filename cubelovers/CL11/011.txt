Dan Hoey is correct.  Mirror-Image-of-Start is at level 12.
Edges-Flipped is at level 9.  Mirror-Image-of-Start-and-Edges-Flipped
is at level 15.  And, of course, Start is at Level 0.  This exhausts
the list of configurations with order-24 symmetry.

I am still thinking about the easiest way to extract sequences of
operators from my data base.  I gather from Dan's comments that a
12-qt operator is known for Mirror-Image-of-Start.  Are operators
known for the other two cases?  This is going to be sufficiently
time-consuming that I don't want to try to find operators that
are already known.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
