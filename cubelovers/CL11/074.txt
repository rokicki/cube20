Not so.  There's nothing that says all permutations must be present.
Back in '92 when I first wrote the program to solve Tangle #1, I fiddled
with it a bit and found that removing a particular tile and adding a
duplicate of a second particular tile caused the solution to become
unique.  It didn't take long to find such a combination, so I'm confident
there are many many more that have unique solutions.

Hm, using just the set of 24 distinct tiles, I wonder if it's possible to
tile the faces of a 2x2x2 cube such that colors match at the edges of the
cube as well as within the faces?...
