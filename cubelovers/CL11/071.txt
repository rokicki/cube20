My program is a bit faster, but as I have less machines at my disposal
and I started a bit later, my programs are still running.
Up until now they did not produce a solution either. I am starting
to get worried.

The same goes for me.

I have the puzzles myself, and checked the info in the message from
Dale I Newfield (15 Dec 1993), which quotes the archives.
I can assure you: those are indeed the duplicate pieces.

I thought about that too, but considered that the choice for precisely
those four duplicate pieces could be dictated by the desire to have
a solution for the 10x10.

Question: did you add pieces at random, or did you add more duplicate
pieces?
In the latter case you may have found the duplications that should have
been made to get a solvable 10x10.
That in turn would show there could not exist an argument disallowing
10x10 (as claimed by Dik Winter), unless that argument is based on the
particular colouring of the four duplicated pieces...
