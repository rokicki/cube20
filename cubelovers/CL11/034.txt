My memory may be extremely faulty of course, but was there not more than
one single solution for the 5x5?  (Not unprecedented, I have one puzzle
that promises a single solution but there are hundreds.)  And, is there
a solution for the 10x10?  I seem to remember that there was (or I had)
a convincing argument that such a thing did not exist.  I should go through
the lesser used parts of my memory one of these days.
