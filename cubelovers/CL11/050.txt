I missed it on the 5x5 because my program was fast enough that I didn't
look further.  When I modified my program to try the 10x10 last week, I
did come up with the ordering Jan suggests.  It shaved about 1/3 the
running time off my 5x5 search, but it actually doesn't seem to make
that big a difference in the 10x10.

It turns out the 10x10 search isn't quite as bad as I thought, because
the tree does get trimmed rather early.  When a piece is constrained on
two edges, there are on average only 2/3 choices for that piece.  I've
got my program chugging along, and so far it has eliminated 4 of the 96
choices for piece (w/ orientation) for the upper left corner.  There are
4896 choices for the first 4 points in the search order, and it's going
through one choice per 25 minutes on average, so it'll finish in a mere
3 months, if I have the patience for it.  (I may try to dig up some
otherwise idle workstations to leave running over the holiday break.)
