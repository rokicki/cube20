WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SHARE WHAT YOU KNOW WITH 
PRE-COLLEGE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS BY ELECTRONIC MAIL?

Recent estimates indicate that there are now more than 
300,000 classroom teachers from primary, middle, and 
secondary schools who hold accounts on the Internet.  
This makes a very special kind of learning available to 
them: one which directly involves subject matter experts 
communicating with students and teachers about their 
specialties, via electronic mail.

With support from the Texas Center for Educational 
Technology, we (at the University of Texas at Austin) 
have piloted and are now expanding an Internet-based 
service (the "Electronic Emissary") that brings together 
pre-college students, their teachers, and subject matter 
experts (SMEs) electronically, helping them to create 
telecomputing exchanges centered around the students' 
learning in the SMEs' disciplines.  For example, 
	
*  A class studying South America could learn about 
recent global environmental research results from a 
scientist who studies rainforest deforestation in 
Brazil.  
	
*  A class studying geometry might "talk" electronically 
with Euclid, who is actually a mathematics professor.  
	
*  A class studying the future of education might 
converse with an emerging technologies specialist from 
California's Silicon Valley.  
	
*  A class studying American History might 
electronically interview Harry Truman, who is really a 
curator with the National Archives.  
	
*  A class exploring the rapidly-changing governmental 
structures that are emerging in what was once the Soviet 
Union might correspond with a group of graduate 
political science students at a university in the CIS.  
	
*  Or, a class reading _Huckleberry Finn_ might 
correspond with an African-American studies scholar 
about the repercussions resulting from the enacting of 
the Emancipation Proclamation.

In successive phases of the project, increasing numbers 
of SMEs or SME groups are needed to correspond regularly 
(approximately 4 times per week) with primary, middle 
school, or secondary students and their teachers (1 SME 
or expert group per class, study group, or "special 
student").  Each electronic exchange will begin with 
approximately 2 weeks of project planning via electronic 
mail between the SMEs and the teachers.  Communications 
with students will begin on mutually convenient dates, 
and will continue for previously-arranged periods of 
time, usually between 2 and 10 weeks.

Subject matter expert volunteers are sought in all 
disciplines, but there is immediate need for SMEs with 
expertise in:

~  gravity and satellite motion
~  heat transfer
~  Hitler's rise to power during World War II
~  the Indian Wars (1870's & 1880's)
~  20th century fragmentation due to weapons of war, 
   especially the atom bomb
~  Maya Angelou (and other women in literature)
~  Native American literature, specifically Cherokee
~  George Orwell's _Animal Farm_ & Russian revolutions
~  personal finance
~  geometry
