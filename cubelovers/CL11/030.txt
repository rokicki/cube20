Just to make sure everyone knows what we are talking about, here is a

I had kind of hoped that the connectivity on the different puzzles was
different, instead of just the colors.

(Actually, the sequence I sent before was slightly wrong--here is the
one I actually used. Using Don's format)

But yes, Don's fillpattern still gets more constraints in earlier--here
is the number of constraints at each step
Don's: 0 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2
Mine:  0 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
As you can see, I had my 1's clustered more toward the beginning, which
is non-optimal.

Assuming that there is only a change in color(and not in connectivity),
as was posted by Chris in april of 92, I would think modifying code to
attempt the 10x10 would be fairly simple...(seeing as my code went poof
sometime last year, when a disk crashed(not that it was
complicated))...wanna try?

(Thanks for the pointers to the Apr 92 discussion)
I agree with the concensus expressed in the archives that this puzzle is
inherently "not that great" because no non-brute-force method has been
found/seems to exist.
