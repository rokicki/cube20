I am hardly more than a dilettante of the Cube, but I can perhaps offer
a few suggestions, since this seems to me to be largely psychology and
3-D geometry rather than Cube group theory.

Obviously, it is correct to state that without some a priori knowledge
of the cube's coloring, the cubemeister cannot tell.  As for whether
you call them both Start:

Not at all.  All you have to do is consider the group elements to be
equivalence classes under not only whole-cube rotation but also
reflection.

If you take a(n ordinary) cube and rotate the whole thing a
quarter-turn, the result is not essentially different from the
original - most programs and virtually all humans would consider them
"the same".  Taking the stand that Start and P.A. are the same on the
Edge Cube means only that on the Edge Cube you consider a single group
element to consist of not only a position and all those reachable by
whole-cube rotations, but also those reachable by reflections as well.
The group-theoretic identity is then neither Start nor Pons Asinorum,
but rather the equivalence class containing both those (and 46 other
elements).

When you have achieved any of the 24 elements of the class that we lump
together as Start.

I'd argue the 1x1x1 breaks this statement :-)

What's more, it's not clear what "quarter-turn" includes: it usually
doesn't include slice turns on the 3-Cube, but on the 4-Cube and
higher, they must of necessity be included.

Yes, I would say so.  I would hope most people would.

Right.  I would say that RL' produces a cube that is precisely as
solved as that produced by RR' is - that on the 2x2x2, R and L are in
some sense the same thing.  My position would be that there is only one
Start on the 2-Cube, and it is an equivalence class with 24 members.

I would say that Start and Pons Asinorum on the Edge Cube can be looked
at as mathematically equivalent (though they need not be, if you
choose) but are not intuitively equivalent.  Physical objects generally
cannot be turned into reflected versions of themselves; they normally
*can* be turned into rotated versions of themselves.  Thus, rotations
"feel" equivalent, but reflections don't.

I'm too lazy to answer this; I no longer have the messages describing
exactly what your M-conjugation operation is online.  Presumably, you
implemented some intuitively-reasonable operation, and it produced
identical results for rotations but not reflections.

> 5. What is a reflection, really?

Ouch. Mathematically, this is easy enough: given a center of reflection
P in Cartesian 3-space, one computes the reflection of a point p as
P+(P-p).  All the things one thinks of as reflections can be
represented as this operation compounded with rotation and/or
translation.

There are certainly four cubes - or at least four cube images.  For
there to be only two distinct cubes, one would have to identify some of
them with one another.  However, the only operations (on the cube as a
whole) that will allow identifying two of them are (1) reflection and
(2) recoloring.  If your mathematical treatment considers reflections
or recolorings to be equivalent, then mathematically, there are only
two distinct cubes.  Neither of these operations "feels" trivial,
though, so the four cubes all "feel" distinct.
