Someone else remarks that it's "got to be all edges flipped in place",
and Jerry Bryan remarks that it is.

I disagree.  Look at the 1-2 edge.  If it's "flipped in place", then
since it appears to be fixed, the cube must flip around it.  But then
the four 3 faces would be where the 4 faces actually are.  No, it's
more complicated than just all-edges-flipped.

"[Q]uite extraordinary and wonderful" it is.
