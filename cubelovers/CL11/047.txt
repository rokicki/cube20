Subject:   Process for Antipodal of the Edge Group

This is the first process I have found for the antipodal of Start
in the edge group (edges without corners and without centers).
There are certainly many more, but I have not yet cataloged them
all.

  FR'LFL'B'R'FL'FRBL'BL'

Note that this process (as with any process for the antipodal) is
its own inverse.  Hence, you can use it once to get from Start to
the antipodal, and again to get from the antipodal to Start.  Also,
the "natural" inverse (namely, LB'LB'R'F'LF'RBLF'L'RF') is also
a process which will go in either direction, Start to the antipodal,
or antipodal to Start.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
