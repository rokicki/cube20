      ...  It is really quite extraordinary and wonderful.  I already knew
      that there were only four equivalence classes with 24 elements.  Well,
      two of them are Start itself and its antipodal.  Without further ado:...

   This is very interesting indeed!  
   So the next natural question would seem to be: What are the -other- two?

Switch each edge with its antipode, with or without flipping all twelve edges.
