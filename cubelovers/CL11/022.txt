I managed to pick up all four Tangle puzzles in an obscure shop in
Jakarta, Indonesia. The puzzles are similar, except that the extra(25th)
piece is different in each. The solutions for each puzzle are very
different and I could not see any pattern. I solved all 4 using
'intelligent brute force', i.e. made the search as efficient as I could.
But the 10*10 puzzle seems intractable. The 5*5 could be solved using a
486DX2-66 PC in about 20 minutes. The 10*10 will take several months using
my algorithm. 
Does anyone have a more intelligent, or a more brute method? Once this
puzzle has been put in the public domain, we MUST find a solution. So, any
ideas are welcome!
Thanks
