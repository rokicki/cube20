Subject:   Calculating |G\M| (Three Typos)

I have found three typos in my article from this morning.  Two are
trivial, and I would not have bothered to report them.  One of them
is fundamental, and I feel obliged to report a correction.


>for all X in GC[m]\B and all GE[n]\B.  For a while I thought it was
                      and for all Y in GE[n]\B



>We can now say that GC\B is partitioned into GC[1]\B, GC[2]\B, ...
>through GC\B[10] and similarly for GE\B.  Unfortunately, using
         GC[10]\B




>   For a fixed m and n, |BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n]| is constant
                         |(BClass(X)[m] * BClass(Y)[n])\M|
>   for all X in GC[m]\B and all Y in GE\[n]\B, where GC[m] is
>   the set of all X in GC such that CSind(X)=m and GE[n] is the set
>   of all Y in GE such that CSind(Y)=n.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
