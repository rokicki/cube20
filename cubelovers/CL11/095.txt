Subject:   |G\M| - the Nineteen Cases We Know

A - |BClass(X)| for X in GC\B (order of B-conjugate class for corners)
B - |BClass(Y)| for Y in GE\B (order of B-conjugate class for edges)
C - |GC[A]\B| (number of B-conjugate classes of size A for corners)
D - |GE[B]\B| (number of B-conjugate classes of size B for edges)
E - |BClass(X) * BClass(Y)| = |BClass(X)| * |BClass(Y)| / 2
F - |BClass(X) * BClass(Y)| * |GC[A]\B| * |GE[B]\B| / 48
    (number of M-conjugates of |GC[A]\B * GE[B]\B)

Note that we have covered over 99.99 percent of edge positions (which
are combined with all corner positions), and over 96.9 percent of
the remaining corner positions (which are combined with all edge
positions).  Hence, we have covered about 99.99969 percent of all
positions.  However, that last fraction of a percent is going to
be devilishly difficult.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
