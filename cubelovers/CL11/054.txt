Subject:   9 Qturn Sequence for All-Edges-Flipped in the Edge Group

RUB DRB LDB  (the spaces are for readability only).

Remember that this is for the "edges without corners and without centers"
case.  Hence, the edges are all flipped and are all properly configured
with respect to each other, but they are not flipped "in place" with
respect to a fixed coordinate system of centers.  They are rotated with
respect a fixed coordinate system of centers.
