I recently picked up this puzzle on a trip to Houston, TX.
It is really sad that even though this puzzle is made in China by a Hong
Kong company, I had to go to the US to get it! It is not available for
sale here in Hong Kong.
Many thanks for your tip. If any one knows about any other interesting
puzzles, they are welcome to contribute!

Cheers!
