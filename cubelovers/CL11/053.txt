I am sorry to say I haven't implemented the search yet.
The 5x5 is solved, so that isn't that interesting anymore; the 10x10
has such a huge search space, that it will need a very efficient
algorithm and/or clever representation. I just haven't decided on the
representation yet. I did decide on the search order though.
