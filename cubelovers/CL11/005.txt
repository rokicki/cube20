    Instead of toy stores, I'd try game stores.  I don't know if you'll
be able to find a Square-1 or not.  It has been a couple of years since
they come out.

    I believe that this company has not been around for several years.
I did buy a couple of their "cubes" about ten years ago.  But at some
point they seemed to have disapeared.  Too bad they had some unique
variations.

    Yes.  It seems that just recently Ishi Press has made some of the
cube-variants available.  I saw a 5x5x5 cube in a game store recently
from Ishi Press.  Game stores are a good place to look since Ishi has
long been providing products for the games; Go and Shogi.  Note that
there is even an email address!
