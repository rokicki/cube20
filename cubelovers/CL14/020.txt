IMO it is not.  Without seeing it, I can't be sure, but it seems likely
that it's Just Another Dumb Reporter.  Perhaps someone took notes and
wrote down 10^15 instead of 10^12, and then looked up the name for
10^15 and didn't notice the basic inconsistency of jumping from Gb to
Pb without stopping at Tb.

Hmmm, this is drifting off-topic for cube-lovers....
