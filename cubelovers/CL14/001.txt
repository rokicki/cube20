I responded at great length, showed a group for CG/C, and concluded
as follows.

This just *has* to be wrong.  I just don't see any way that any
of the flavors of C are a normal subgroup of their respective
flavors of CG.  The presence or absence of the Face-centers can't
have anything to do with it.  I was jumping to the conclusion that
since I found a group for some of the flavors of CG/C, that therefore
the respective C's must be normal.

I have reread my note, and it still looks to me like I found groups
for all the CG/C's I discussed.  I would invite instruction and
correction from any of you group theory experts out there, but here
is the way it looks to me.

Using G and H generically for a group and subgroup (not necessarily
cubes at all), G/H is a group if H is a normal subgroup of G,
under the "natural" operation {Xh} * {Yh} = {(XY)h} (where {Xh}
etc. denotes all h in H.)  Coset notation would be (xH)(yH)=(xy)H.
Under these circumstances, G/H is the factor group of H in G.

My group operation on the cosets not the "natural" operation.
It gets around the fact that C is not normal by picking specific
rather than arbitrary elements of the cosets in order to perform
the group operation, namely a picking specific element which fixes
the same cubie for all cosets.  I guess this means that CG/C is not
the factor group of C in CG (such a thing being impossible), but
by golly it still looks like a group to me under the "unnatural"
operation ??
