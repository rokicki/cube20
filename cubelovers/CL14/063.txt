I will see how I divide it now, but I can change easily.  My biggest
change is to weed out parity.  I just realized that, but that is the
reason it will not fit now.  Moreover, I will go completely forward
to get also local maxima.

I do not know yet what to do about the quarter turn version.  I never
put that in my program for this phase.  I had some form of quarter
turn version, but only for U and D.

I will see, dik
