Subject:   Squares Group

On 9 Aug 1994, Mark Longridge posted God's Algorithm results for
the squares group <H> consisting entirely of 180 degree turns.
Mark invited corroboration.  The following will serve to verify
Mark's results, and will also provide the same information for
the M-conjugacy classes of <H>.  Notice that the ratio of cube
positions to M-conjugacy classes never gets very close to 48.
Hence, there are a significant number of positions in <H>
at each level of the search tree that are at least somewhat
"symmetrical".
