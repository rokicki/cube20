>I KNOW you guys would like a 4x4x4 cube,

Last catalog that I received from the maker of the 5x5x5 and Skewb also had
a 4x4x4 in it, though that was a few years ago.

Meanwhile, I think the 4x4x4 is still on store shelves in the country where
Ishi gets its other stuff, and its name, from.  But it costs around 3,000 yen.
