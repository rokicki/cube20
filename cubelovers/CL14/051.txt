there are several places you might try.

dik winter first wrote about this new searching algorithm on may 3, 1992,
and there was a bit of discussion after that.  so you can look through
the archives (cube-mail-8).

if you are a member of nkc (nederlands kubus club) you might look
through the newsletter cff (cubism for fun) issue #28 where herbert
kociemba first writes about his algorithm.

also, martin gave some info about the cube-lovers archives being
available on the world-wide-web.
