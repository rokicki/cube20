My experience matches yours, in that only the orange side has trouble.
I found that a tiny little dab of plain ordinary contact cement would
nail down a sticker very nicely.  Four of the 25 orange-side stickers
on my 5x5x5 (which I understand the local shop got from Ishi Press, btw
Anton :-) show evidence of my having used a little too much contact
cement; I don't recall how many others got glued with a more
appropriate amount.

As for 4x4x4s, I own one but have been unable to find it lately.  This
doesn't bother me especially, since given a 5x5x5, if you just ignore
the center slice along each axis (remove the stickers, paint white-out
over them, etc) and you have something mathematically identical to a
4x4x4.
