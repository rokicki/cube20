Start by numbering all the facelets and defining your generators (about
which there might be some controversy), and call the resulting group G.
Decide which permutations you consider equivalent and call this set K.
K would probably include such things as the whole cube rotations C,
as well invisible permutations of the four center facelets, etc.
In most reasonable choices for K, K would certainly be a group.  Your
model then becomes the set of cosets G/K (which is *not* a factor
group!  I am learning.).  The questions then become: 1) can you define
an operation on the cosets G/K such that G/K is a group, and 2) can you
find a mapping from G/K onto a subgroup of G such that the mapping
respects costs?  If the answer to both questions is "yes", then it is
this subgroup of G which you would want to put into GAP.

By the way, I am sensitive to the distinction between G and CG, but in
the case of any Face centerless cube such as 2x2x2 or 4x4x4, it would
seem to me that the distinction is less important than in cubes with
Face centers such as 3x3x3 and 5x5x5.
