I have indeed considered this, but have not yet come to a conclusion.

I do not know whether this is clear for all readers.  My reasoning
was similar but the conclusion different, but someway equivalent:
If the minimal sequence contains a half-turn, we may just as well
assume that that half turn is the last, and F2.  I do not know
whether the proof has been shown on this list, but it is simple.
Suppose M is a minimal sequence, and Z is some random sequence,
in that case Z M Z' is also superflip.  Take Z the maximal
sequence at the end consisting of quarter-turns only, we end with
a sequence of equal length terminating with a half-turn.
Because of symmetry we may just as well consider it to be F2.

This needs more than simple symmetry.  There are 12*8 different
endings, and we have 48 symmetries (24 by rotation * 2 by inversion).
Leaving 2 cases.  I considered this, but have not yet come to
conclusions.  On the other hand I do not yet know what to conclude
from M M' = I for every superflip sequence.

Yes, I had seen that.  One of the major reasons I was not amused when
the system crashed doing depth 17 in stage 1!  I will restart the
program doing depth 17, but I will first redo the counting so that
counts larger than 2^32 are correct.
