   I thought it was

	   kilo	10^3
	   mega	10^6
	   giga	10^9
	   tera	10^12
	   peta	10^15
	   exa	10^18

[...]

   Also note that the Cube database storage size requires the highest
   prefix we have.  Time to get SI to think up some more, I guess :-)

(Warning to Cube-Lovers: this is off the topic, but it's a digression
I can never resist.  Alan is going to come over to my house and soap
my windows for this, I just know it.)

They _have_ thought up some more -- this was in Science News about 18
months ago.  But the ones they thought up are absolutely awful, and I
want to take this opportunity to advertise my own suggestions.

First note the following relationships, which I believe are entirely
the result of coincidence:

te(t)ra     1000^4	
pe(n)ta     1000^5
(h)exa      1000^6

In each case, the prefix for 1000^n looks like the neo-greek prefix
for n, with the second-to-last consonant deleted.  I merely propose
that we continue this scheme:

he(p)ta     1000^7
o(c)to      1000^8
(en)nea     1000^9

I admit to a fudge with n=9, but I like neabytes better than
eneabytes, and the prefix E was already taken by n=6.  I wanted to
keep up the unique sequence of prefixes: K, M, G, T, P, E, H, O, N.

For those who care, megameters are good for measuring small planets,
gigameters for big planets and stars, and terameters for solar
systems.  A petameter is about a tenth of a light year, and so it's
good for measuring near interstellar distances; exameters are good for
the 100-ly range, galaxies should be measured with hetameters, and
intergalactic distances with otometers.  Current theory says the
universe is considerably smaller than one neameter.
