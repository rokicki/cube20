...and now that Alan has _that_ out of his system...     ;-)

For the interested:

A topic that has come up a few times (and of which I was in hot pursuit for
a couple of years):  I just got a new Ishi Press flier in the mail
yesterday.  Among other toys they were selling 5X5X5 cubes for $20 (+S&H).

There order number is (800) 859-2086.
