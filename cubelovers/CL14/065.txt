The basis is similar (although Kociemba's algorithm uses searching to
get solutions while Thistlethwaite's uses tables and directly arrives
at solutions).  The main difference is that once a solution is found
Thistlethwaite's algorithm stops.  Kociemba's algorithm continues finding
newer solutions (even longer than the original solution) to phase 1 and
trying to fit them with a solution for phase 2 such that the total solution
is shorter.  This proves to be very effective.  Of course this is easier to
do with a 2 phase algorithm than with a 4 phase algorithm.

Given time Kociemba's algorithm will find a minimal solution.  I confess
that my implementations does not if the configuration can be solved
through phase 2 only, but the cube can be rotated to avoid that.  The
reason is that ultimately Kociemba's algorithm will find longer part
solutions of phase 1 and ultimately stumble on a complete solution in
phase 1 which will be minimal because of the breadth first search.

But it can take long.  Getting a minimal solution if the length is 16
or less appears to be doable.  If the length is 19 or more it takes an
awfully long time.  What I have found until now is:
1.  There are no configurations known that require 21 turns or more,
    and I checked an awfully large number.
2.  There are known configurations that require 18 turns.
The middle part is a grey area.
