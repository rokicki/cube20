Martin was kind enough not to point out that 6*9 is 54 rather than 56.

With some of my models it can be reduced slightly more.  Since
representative elements of equivalence classes are what are being stored,
the representative element can be chosen to fix a cubie of your choice.
The cubie which is being fixed need not be stored.  This trick does
not work, of course, if all cube positions are being stored rather
than just representative elements.
