One more correction to this giga, tera, peta, nonsense.  Since
10^9 bytes of disk space cost about 10^3 USD, then 10^18 bytes would
cost about 10^12 USD.  This is more than Bill Gates could afford, more
than going to the moon, more than an aircraft carrier, and indeed is
of the same order of magnitude as the entire United States federal
budget.  Disk prices need to come down several orders of magnitude
before we can think about storing God's Algorithm.
