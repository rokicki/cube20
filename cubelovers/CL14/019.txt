You are correct, of course.  In retrospect, the aspect of the
article in the Chronicle that waylaid me (and which I still find
puzzling) is the absence of any mention of "tera".  It is a giant
jump from "giga" to "peta", skipping "tera" on the way.  But "giga"
and "peta" were juxtaposed in the article.  I have known how big
"tera" is for years  -- can't believe I screwed it up.  It makes me
wonder if the article had it right.  It is reasonable to jump from
gigabytes to petabytes in one fell swoop?
