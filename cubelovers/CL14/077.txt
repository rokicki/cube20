	If you notice the last line of the ishius@holonet.net post, they
also mention the stickers sliding, which is what I was addressing.  I've
only noticed 1 or 2 out of the at least 30 I've seen that *don't* have a
problem with the orange stickers: sliding off, dog earing etc.

	The problem of the center caps coming off is separate, and much
easier to fix.  Actually, before you glue them on you may want to adjust
the tensions of the screws on all the axes (only requiring one cap per
axis, not all six).  The few I've done this to move much smoother when
loosened (just a bit, as being too loose can cause problems of its own).
