Subject: Cyclic Decomposition

In the corner group, (RFU)^5 exchanges corners fur and bur.  I only
mention this because of all the tools I use, it is the only one that
involves a lot of repetition.  It's a fossil from my earliest cube
solution, c. 1980, which used _only_ repetitive processes.

(RFU)^5 is only useful to me because I solve corners first.
One-face-first solvers will find this incomprehensible.
