You are certainly correct.  And as Dan Hoey pointed out to me via
private E-mail once upon a time, for Q turns you can get it down
to only one bit by storing (depth modulo 4)/2 because you can infer
the state of the low order bit from the parity of cube position.
(Parity of the cube position equals the parity of the depth for Q turns,
but not for Q+H turns.)

But I tend to think that certain kinds of interesting analyses
of a data base for the entire God's Algorithm
would be greatly assisted by storing the entire depth.
