I have removed all three of you from the Cube-Lovers mailing list.

Note, please, that all three of you sent your requests to be removed to
Cube-Lovers as a whole.  You should have sent them to me,
Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU, instead of bothering the entire list.  This
was all clearly explained in the introductory note I sent you when you
first subscribed (earlier this month for two of you).  This is, in fact, a
wide-spread Internet convention.  If you can remember it, you can often
avoid looking like an idiot in front of hundreds of people.

I'm sorry to bother everybody else on Cube-Lovers by CC'ing this note to
you all, but this way I can perhaps prevent more copy-cat repetitions of
the same annoying mistake.

REMEMBER:

  SEND SUBMISSIONS TO: Cube-Lovers@AI.MIT.EDU

  SEND ADMINISTRATIVE CORRESPONDENCE TO: Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU

GOT IT?
