great!

this is true.  i decided i was more interested in performance than
in knowing about local maxima.

let me offer a suggestion here.  since i divided the corner configurations
by symmetry, it might be nicer if you divide the U-D edge configurations
by symmetry.  (the numbers involved are the same.)

it's always nice to confirm a calculation like this using a different method.
although what i'm suggesting isn't much of a change.
