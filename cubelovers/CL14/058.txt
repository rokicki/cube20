I can confirm Mike's results on phase 1.  Here follows my table which
also contains the number of local maxima (which you will not find in
"backward" steps):

turns		 q	   loc.max	       q+h	   loc.max
    0	         1			         1
    1	         4			         4
    2	        34			        50

I got 131 minutes for quarter turns and 186 minutes for face turns on a
measly SGI Challenge, apparently not so very fast.  (I presume it would
have been faster if it had been possible to run with 64 bit long's.)

I will try to verify phase 2 later next week.
