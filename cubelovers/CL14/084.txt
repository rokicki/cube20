I think we have a winner.  I compared the data base for level 0
through 9 against the same data base superflipped, with no
matches.  That should mean that there is no 18-turn or less
sequence for superflip.

Adding in level 10 will take a bit longer.  Also, there
is some minor new programming involved in this particular effort.
When I do get level 10 added in, and do get a match, that should
be a complete validation of the new programming, and complete
confirmation that the 20-turn sequence is minimal.
