I am talking about quarter turns.  "Quarter turns" is in the
subject of Dik's note????  If Dik's figures are for face turns,
then Mike's 26q solution is still the best so far, and we have
a long way to go.

(Oops.  I just peeked at Dik's 20 move solution.  It is definitely
for face turns.  In fact, as a quarter turn solution, it is 28
quarter turns.)
