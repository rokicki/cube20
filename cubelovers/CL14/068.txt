YOU ARE AN IDIOT!  WHY DID YOU ASK THE -ENTIRE- MAILING LIST?

I told you quite clearly when I added you that you get off the list by
sending mail to Cube-Lovers-REQUEST@AI.MIT.EDU.

And I am purposely CC'ing this message to the entire Cube-Lovers mailing
list in order to remind everyone else about Cube-Lovers-REQUEST, because
invariably when one idiot makes this mistake, a whole pack of other
lemming-idiots follows the first idiot and makes the same mistake.
