	With regard to the stickers (as far as I can tell just the orange
side has problems) I had good luck following the suggetions that came with
mine (written up by Christoph Bandelow).  They recommend placing a piece of
paper over the cube and ironing (not too hot).  This melts the glue and the
stickers get a better grip.  I've not had any problems since.
