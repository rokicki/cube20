Subject: Poll
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

   In line with the recent cubeing contest in Boston, I suggest a poll.
Such questions as, will be included:
1. age
2. average solving time
3 occupation  (if student, undergrad or grad and major)
4. solving method
5. how long it took you physically  working (playing) with the cube  (or some
   facimile, like a program) to solve the cube the first time, and reliably
6. how long have you been working with the cube  (say since Jan. '81)
7. max #of qtw. in method, avg. # of qtw. in method
 
I would not suggest anybody send their answers to the list, because
1. it would generate a lot of semi-useless garbage in the list,and
2. you would lose anonymity (which is one of the aspects of a poll)

If anyone can suggest how this could be implemented please pass it on.

I18-5 is not distinct from I18-6 so may be taken off the list

Concerning Sources:
I found none of these by exhaustive search so I believe that this is far
from a complete list esp. in 18 region.
I used several methods to derive these identities
1. from two processes which have same effect , I concatanate the inverse of
the second to the first, and remove noops.
2. from 1 process which affects only the d face or not the U face,
I twist both the D and U faces, run the reverse process (maybe with an 
orientation change) then untwist the D and U faces.
3. examine old identities for similarities shift/rotate/invert/reflect
appropriatly concatanate and remove noops.

Subject: 10 sided "cube"
To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC
cc: katz at USC-ISIF

I have a 10 sided "cube", which is made by "Wonderful Puzzler" (they also
make crappy cheapo regular cubes).  The guts are essentially the same as
the regular cube, but the corners are cut off.

If you look down from the top, you see an octogon.  The edges are all the 
same as a regular cube, but since the corners are cut, they are one color
(thus the 10 colors).  For example, there are red, blue, and orange
faces.  On an ordinary cube you would have a red-blue-orange corner cubie,
but on this in its place is a pink face.  To make this clearer, here is
the coloring of the thing:

				red
				 *
      light-blue**gold**yellow**blue**pink**orange**violet**green
				 *
			       white

(red on top, white on bottom, looking at the blue face, back face is green,
right face is orange, left face is gold).

The interesting thing about this is that unlike the ordinary cube, every cube 
does not have a place,  you dont know that the pink corner goes between the 
blue and orange faces (in an ordinary cube it is the red-blue-orange corner 
so you know where it goes).  To solve it, you just put the corners in some
order, solve it using the usual transformations, and then if you get a 
"parity error" you must go back to the top layer but switch two of the corners
and solve it again.  Thus in general you have to solve it almost 2 times!
(almost because you dont have to redo the top layer or half of the second
layer (this assumes you solve top down, which I do.)).

What I mean by parity error is that if the corners are switched you can get 
a configuration that in an ordinary cube would tell you the cube is put
together wrong.  For example, you can be solving it and get to a point where
an odd number of edges must be fliped.  


There may be a transformation to flip an odd number of edges with this cube,
but I have not found it.  Anyway its more interesting to solve and it
changes it shape in general with each transformation.  (unlike the cube 
which stays a cube; this is a octagonal prism).

To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC

  The 10-sided cube was discussed a couple of months ago.  The main result
was that the easiest way to solve it was "side across" - that is, don't
start from the octagonal face, but from one of the "sides".  Then the
last layer should be solvable except for a possible edge-flip.  Note that
there are two new difficulties with this cube: the one mentioned, and the
single edge flip.  SPOILER! This is, of course, an optical illusion, brought
about by the fact that the second edge, which of course is also flipped, is
a uni-colored edge, and you can't see it.

Subject: Barrel Puzzle instructions
To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC

I just purchased one of the "Wonderful Barrel" puzzles mentioned in
Stan Isaac's note, and I found the enclosed set of instructions to be
a classic.  I figured I'd pass them on, in case some of the members of
this list don't buy the puzzle itself.  The first couple of paragraphs
are not so great, but it gets better toward the end.

@begin(verbatim)
"Wonderful Barrel" is a kind of mental game plate also can be regarded
as an indoor ornament.  The red, orange, yellow, green, blue, black
color balls which is inner in barrel can create more than 10 billion
combination to reach a solution and finally be aligned on 5 straight
lines, yet each straight line are with 4 same color balls.

			* PLAY RULE *

Original alignment circumstances is as follow:  there are three black
balls are set on SHELTER but each black ball is above a shore of
PLUNGER; the 5 straight lines are up the SHELTER with different color
from one another, each line contains 4 same color balls.  The 5
straight lines are aligned in clock-wise with blue, green, yellow,
orange, red color.

As you know, the original alignment is orderly, now you can
circumvolve DRUM, then operate plunger up and down for taking the ball
out from SHELTER.  While you put the ball into SHELTER again, the
order of "each straight line with 4 same color ball" has been broken
to confused state.

Now, a challenge is ahead of you, you often successful in this line
but irregularly in that line, in a word, it always can not come to a
satisfactory arrangement of the whole lines fluently.

At the beginning, it is not easy to arrange the 5 straight lines
return to initial order in short time, so please try to solve this
puzzle from one line first, then completion of two, three, four even
to whole lines are returned to initial order finally.

At last, maybe you can analyse the mystery out, but maybe you can not
solve it today; however, how about tomorrow?  one month later? one
year later? or ten years later you may still continued to challenge to
it singlely and unwilling.
@end(verbatim)

P.S.  I @i(tried) to proofread this, but as you can see, it was difficult.

Subject:  Results of an exhaustive search to six quarter-twists
Message-Id: <14Aug81 011137 DH51@CMU-10A>

	The first answer is that there are exactly 878,880 cube
positions at a distance of 6 quarter-twists from solved, and so
983,926 positions at 6qtw or less.  These figures reflect a decrease
of 744 from the previously known upper bounds.

	It turns out that the twelve-qtw identities reported by
Chris C. Worrell <ZILCH at MIT-MC> are complete, in a sense.  The
only reservation here is that a fifth rule must be added to his
list of the ways in which ``a generator generates other
identities.''  This rule is substitution with shorter identities,
and it's not too surprising that it was left out, since the only
shorter identities are the ``trivial'' ones like XXXX=XYX'Y'=I,
where X and Y are opposite faces.  In the case of the twelve-qtw
identities, this means that identities of the form aXXb and aX'X'b
generate each other.

	The structure of the 12-qtw identities is clearer if we
write them in a transformed way:

I12-1	FR' F'R    UF' U'F    RU' R'U
I12-2	FR' F'R   UF'   F'L FL'   U'F
I12-3	FR' F'R   UF'   UL' U'L   FU'

	The fifth rule is necessary so that I12-2 may generate the
identities

I12-2a	 FR' F'R   UF   FL FL'   U'F	and
I12-2b	F'R' F'R   UF   FL FL'   U'F'.

To see that this rule is necessary, it need only be observed that
inversion, rotation, reflection, and shifting all preserve the
number of clockwise/counterclockwise sign changes between
cyclically adjacent elements.

	In what sense are the ``trivial'' identities trivial?  I
have come to believe that they are trivial only because they are
short and simple enough that they are well-understood.  The only
identities for which I can find any theoretical reasons for calling
trivial are the identities of the form XX'=I.  In spite of the
simplicity of the ``trivial'' identities, their occurrence is one
of the major reasons that Alan Bawden and I were unable to show
earlier that I12-1-3 generated all identities of length 12.  I fear
that the combination of 4-qtw and 12-qtw identities may turn out to
be a major headache when dealing with identities of length 14 and
16.

Conjugating by (U'RUR'F'U)', we get 
			F'LFL' U'FU'R UR'F'U

Subject: Re: 10 sided "cube"
In-reply-to: KATZ's message of 4 Aug 1981 1123-PDT
To: Cube-Lovers at MIT-MC
cc: Lynn.es@PARC

I last week picked up one of the same octagonal cubes (Wonderful Puzzler
brand) as Alan R. Katz in his message.  I might point out that it shares the same
workmanship and twistability (lack thereof) which Katz attributes to their brand
of standard cube.  

After some experimenting, I found that the "parity error" involved is always a
pair of edges in reverse locations on the bottom.  My solution algorithm is top,
equator, bottom [corner locations, edge locations, edge orientations, corner
orientations].  On an ordinary cube, one pair of edges reversed never happens
when you go to position edges.  I suspect that if your algorithm does edge
locations before corners, then two corners in wrong locations would be the parity
error.  Incidentally, the parity of Katz's cube is the reverse of mine, though the
center cubie colors are in the same relation to each other.  

Edge orientation (I assume that is what Katz meant by "edges must be fliped")
parity errors are irrelevant to getting the cut-edge-colors rightly paritied.  Edge
orientation parity errors happen because one of the cut-edges may have been
oriented wrongly.  Or more precisely, an odd number of them reversed from the
way they were virginally (but they look right either direction).  This is easily
cured by any of the "flip a pair of edges" macros.  

The change in cube shape is actually helpful in solving, except for being
difficult to grab sometimes.  Corners that need orientation really stand out.  The
Greenwich meridian edges (assuming you solve it from the top down with the
octagonal faces left and right), being different shape, are instantly located.  

The best part of the Wonderful Puzzler is the instructions, which I quote here:

THE CHALLENGE:
"ORIGINAL PUZZLER" presents not only a unique challenge but offers the
possibility of countless hours of relaxation.  Your mental ingenuity may be tested
for a few hours -- many days -- several weeks -- or even a period of much
longer duration.  If you can determine the key to unlock the knack for solving
the PUZZLER, the final trimph can be the psychological turning point in your
life.  Mathematicians may be tested to the limit and cry over this one -- and you
may, too!  You will gain a measure of satisfaction when you align one plane. 
You will be delighted with the completion of two.  You will be elated with the
completion of three or four!  The completion of the fifth plane will quicken your
pulse!! -- and you will have scaled the peak once the last unit of the sixth plane
falls into place!!!!

PREPARATION & CAUTION:
*Spin the PUZZLER several times, as indicated on the cover, until all color units
are randomly distributed on each of six planes.
*Do NOT remove any color unit in the process of play.
*Initially, activate the random distribution GENTLY.  With little use, this can be
accomplished easily and smoothly.
Patience and persistence will beat the Puzzler!  Good Luck!

Challenge
Can you contend with more than 18'000'000'000 combination to reach a solution?
*end of quote*

I think the errors remaining above are all theirs.  It is full of little gems: turning
point in your life, solving five planes (on the standard cube, which I believe
has the same instructions), 18 billion (better than Ideal's guess).  The GENTLY
caution is valid; a neighbor kid blew mine apart, including a center cubie, by
ignoring this.

  A nice way to recolor the 10 sided cube is to give a side a quarter twist,
so it looks sort of like a baseball, and then make the (fairly) obvious
4 groups of 9 faces each in four colors, and two in-between stripes of 3
facies each.  Each of the 9-facie groups will have 2 triangular facies, and
3 slant rectangular facies, and 4 squares.  I think its a fairly simple
variation to solve, but I just made it last night and have not worked with
it much yet.
  By the way, I just got my first magic tetrahedron.  This one came from

seconds".  Anyone have any more information on this?  Like where
Hofstadter found out about this guy?

2) In the reports about the "Regional Cubing Championship" held here
in July the best time listed is 48.31 seconds, held by a 10 year old
named Jonathan Cheyer.  (See PDL's message to Cube-Lovers dated 27 Jul
1981.)

3) I seem to remember reports that there were Hungarians who averaged
around 50 seconds.  I thought I had read this in Singmaster, but I can't seem
to find it there.

4) The best time anyone will admit to on this list (as determined by

claimed by both Richard Pavelle (RP@MIT-MC) and Alan Katz (KATZ@ISIF).
Also Stan Isaacs (ISAACS@SRI-KL) claims that his two children take
about 1 1/4 minutes using essentially his methods.

5) Finally, Dan Pehoushek (JDP@SU-AI) tells me that a friend of his

To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

This rush week, my fraternity extended a bid to a freshman by the name of
Larry Singer who generally solves the cube in 1:13 or thereabouts (my
average time is 1:40).  All day Monday, our bids were playing such games as
"Pledge Pong" or "Pledge Pool."  The idea here is that the bid challenges
an active to a game of pool or ping-pong, and if he loses, he pledges.
Well, Monday night, Larry challenged me to "Pledge Cube."  One of the
brothers uniformly scrambled two cubes, and we were to compete in a
head-to-head competition.  Well, we both were under considerable pressure,
naturally, and we both made several mistakes while solving the cube.  I
won, but my winning time was 2:09.  Larry and his close friend then both
pledged.

So now, no one in the house can tell me that there's no practical use for
the Rubik's cube.

I am new to the list, and in reading the archives, I found that
the transform for my favorite pattern was listed incorrectly.
Specifically, I refer to the Don Woods' message of 6 January which
listed transforms for the Snake, Worm, and Baseball (I think).
Anyway, the transform listed for the Snake was incorrect.  What is
listed IS a pretty pattern, merely the wrong one.  The blurb about
how to "hack" your way to the Snake, however, is correct.  The
proper transform to achieve the snake (from Singmaster) is:
 
            * * * S P O I L E R * * *

   Some short notes on various cube stuff - will try to expand on some of it
later:
1. The Stanford Shopping Center/Games and Things cube contest of a couple of
   saturdays ago:  was won by Paul cunningham, 16 yrs old. There were about
   40 entries; there were something like 8 rounds to get to a winner, double
   elimination, each pair fighting it out with the best average of 3 cubes,
   all cubes in a round scrambled exactly the same way.  Best average-of-three
   time was 56 seconds.  Best time was 41 seconds. David Tabuchi, the Games
   & Things speedster, has a best average-of-ten speed of 43 seconds!  Brian
   Robinson, with whom he works on the cube, has a best average-of-ten of 41
   seconds.  Davids fastest time was 24.98 seconds!!!
2. Cubes are multiplying like hotcakes.  Not only changes in labeling, but
   also changes in shape.  I have seen or heard reports of about 8 shape
   variations, and multiple size variations, from about 19 mm to about 60 mm.
   And someone told me of a 12mm or so version.  The corners have been cut off
   in 3 different ways (The nicest cuts them halfway through the neighboring
   edge, and uses 14 colors).  The magic Tetrahedron is readily available now.
   There is a build-it-yourself cube kit.  There are still reports of the
   elusive 4x4x4 cube, but no actual sightings as far as I know.  By the
   way, I collect puzzles, and am trying to find many of these cube variations.
   If anyone knows where I can actually buy some, or would get me some, please
   let me know.  I will be happy to pay or trade for them.
3. The snake is not a cube, but it is a toy/puzzle/art object that should a
   appeal to cube-lovers.  It also comes in a variety of colors and sizes.
4. Also lots of new books and such. Such as:
   a. Don Kolve, of Kirkland, Wash.  He solves Top-middle-bottom(position
      corners,twist corners, flip edges, position edges).
   b. L.E.Hordern, of England.  He does: bottom-middle-top ( position corners,
      orient corners, orient edges, position edges).
   c. Bridget Last, of Downham, England.  She solves: Define face colors 
      ("The easiest way of deciding which face is to be which colour is to
      define the centre faces as being correct.")  Then: position all corners,
      orient all corners, position (with orientation) all edges.
   d. Bob Easter, a friend in San Francisco, uses just one move to do
      everything. The move is  F R' F' R (an old friend). First he "walks" 
      the edge cubes to their proper corners, then rotates them into proper
      order around the corner, then flips them 2 at a time to get them aligned.
      Then he does similarly with the corners, using the same move, but 
      done 3 times to leave the edges alone.  Lots of quarter twists, but 
      little memory.  Perhaps the ultimate solution for people with strong
      wrists.
   e. Patrick Bussart, Puffin books (a division of Penguin Books).  Patrick
      has been in the news since he is only 12 or 13 years old; his solution
      is very popular in England. He does top corners, top edges, bottom
      corners, position rest of the edges, rotate rest of the edges.
5. I have been re-labeling cubes to make new puzzles, and would appreciate
   suggestions.  I have made tactile cubes of various types (that is, with
   various materials).  I'm trying to make one with 5 or 6 grades of sandpaper,
   but find my touch cannot distinguish between the two middle grades. I
   have made a magic square cube (each face is a 3x3 magic square; the
   problem is to decide what the relative orientations and forms of the squares
   should be; any suggestions?) and a magic cube cube (the center 14 cube is,
   of course, invisible).  And 2 word cubes - one has word squares (there are
   three 3 letter words in each direction), and the other, six 3 word sentences
   (FIX THE BOX, YES YOU CAN, FUN FOR ALL, etc.  I haven't had these long
   enough to know if they are "solvable" without trial and error; I think
   that the magic square cube, especially, is difficult unless you have
   the order in advance.  So far, I have made 2 of them, the first had one
   square marked, which makes it fairly easy (the other 5 squares are forced
   by the first); in the second, I made sure each corner was unique, and the
   edges as different as possible (2 have to be the same); but I haven't had
   time to try it yet.
Enough - this message is too long.

To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC

   The 2x2x2 cube is solved in the corner sub-group, ignoring the (non-existent)
edges.  The so-called "Dinman Style" cube (probably meant to be "diamond")
has the corners cut off and everything stretched to make a somewhat distorted
rhombicuboctahedron (the six center facies are square; the corners are now
triangles, and the old edges are rectangles).  Solving this involves only
positioning moves - all orientation (twisting) is invisible.  Thus these
two cubes involve two "pure" subgroups.  Can anyone design (by either cutting,
recoloring, or even inventing new mechanisms) cubes or pseudo-cubes which
only involve edge-type moves, or which only involve twisting, with
positioning ignored?

To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC

  First of all, I was inaccurate about the "Dinman" style "cube" - it doesn't
only eliminate twisting, but also some positioning (ie, after the top and middle
are solved, the bottom is automatically solved).  Perhaps by the judicious
adding of numbers to the facies, the pure position cube can be made.  Also,
the answer to the edge-only subgroup is easy - just remove all the labels from
the corners, so they are all identically monochromatic.  Is there a more
elegant solution?

  [This message is being sent to Dan Hoey, and refers to his message of
9-Jan-81, subject: The Supergroup -- Part 2: at least 25 qtw and why]
   Appended to this message is a longish message I recieved, which has
some good ideas to use.  In particular, what about using your technique
on a 2x2x2 cube, or an (idealized) edge-only cube?  And then comparing
it with his clculations for the 2x2x2.
   I'm not sure without a 2x2x2 in front of me, but I think there are
only 2 distinct 1 qtw per set of opposite faces, and only one 2qtw move.
And that the period is only 2.  Is that true?  However, there should be
more low-number-of-twists identities.
   I'm distrustful of the actual calculations in the message below, because
I don't see the 9 new configurations after only 1 twist.  I think there are
only 6. Or am I missing something?
  Also, Dan or someone else on the cube-lovers network: how about compiling
all the messages about lower bounds and identities (after a while) into 
one file we can ftp and look at all together.

Subject: Rubik's Cube
Newsgroups: net.games

Want to knoe how far away you can get from the solution on a Rubik's Cube?


   A Simple Lower Bound

As everybody knows, the number of discrete configurations of the 3x3x3
Rubik's Cube is:

(8! * 12! * 3^8 * 2^12) / 12 = 4x10^19 = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000

One approach to a lower bound is to calculate the maximum possible number
of configurations you can reach with a particular number of moves and then
see how many moves you would have to make to reach the number above.

With no moves at all you get 1, the starting position.  The first move gets
you 18, (any one of six faces turned one of three ways).  The next move
gets you 18*15, (no point in turning the same face twice in a row), for a
total of 1+18+270 configurations reached after two moves.  A table of these
values looks like:

	      ---------possible configurations---------
moves                 new   % max                 total
 0                      1   0.0%                      1

10           691980468750   0.0%           741407645089 Notice that
11         10379707031250   0.0%         11121114676339 not until 17

17  118231350402832031250 273.4%  126676446860177176339 maximum.

So there is no possible way to reach some configurations in fewer than
17 moves.  However, this analysis has assumed that each configuration
generated was a NEW one, but there are MANY cases where this will not
be so.  A simple example is turning one face 180 degrees, the opposite
face 180 degrees, and then repeating those two moves -- four moves that
get us to an old, familiar configuration.  If we factor out the sequences
that involve these opposite face identities the minimum number of moves
becomes 18.  Needless to say there are still lots of useless move sequences,
but detecting them becomes a lot trickier.


   A Rumored Upper Bound

Rumor has it that a computer program exists, (attributed to Thistlethwaite),
that provably will solve any Cube configuration in at most 41 moves.


   Narrowing it Down

So the answer is somewhere between 18 and 41.  How do you get further?  One
way is to write a computer program that tries every sequence of moves until
it has generated every possible configuration at least once.  That sounds
easy, and it is, but such a program would take a \\\L O N G/// time to run.
However, if we limit the problem a little by considering a Cube that is two
squares on a side (2x2x2), we have a chance of learning something.


   2x2x2 Cube

By the same considerations stated above we can get a lower bound for the
2x2x2 Cube.  There are 7! * 3^6 = 3,674,160 configurations and, since we
can limit ourselves to moving only three "orthogonal" sides of the 2x2x2
cube, on the n-th move you could reach 9 * 6^(n-1) new configurations thus
we find that with 8 moves you could reach at most 3,023,307 and with 9 you
could reach at most 18,139,851.  (Note that this doesn't have the problem with
opposite side moves that the 3x3x3 cube has.)

Because the 2x2x2 cube is relatively simple we can actually run a program
to try all the possible move sequences and compare our bound with fact.
Listed below are the findings


	 ------new configurations-------    total configurations

Interestingly enough there are 2,644 configurations that require eleven
moves to reach a solution; this is less than one tenth of one percent of
the total configurations!

It's also interesting that it's better than a 50-50 bet that a randomly
ordered 2x2x2 cube can be solved in exactly nine moves, (it's not clear
how to turn this into a profitable bar bet, however).

Noticing that there are only 321 new configurations after three moves
instead of 324 leads us to guess that there are six non-trivial sequences
of six moves that end with the original configuration, (why?).

These results came from a C program running on a VAX 11/780 and even
though the 2x2x2 cube is simple compared to the 3x3x3 it took a lot of
time.  The figures for 11 moves took over 51 hours of cpu time.

If you'd like to make a 2x2x2 cube with which to experiment you can simply
take all the little labels off a 3x3x3 cube except the ones on the corners
and then ignore the unlabeled cubes.

Here's one sequence that gets you to one of the 2,644 configurations:
    f r f r f d2 f d- f d2 r2    f = rotate front face 90 degrees
				 r = rotate right face 90 degrees
				d2 = rotate "down" face 180 degrees
				d- = rotate "down" face 270 degrees


   So Where's That Leave Us?

I just thought of a dandy way to get the answer for the 3x3x3 cube, but
the margins on this news item are a little too small for me to include it ...

(I someone else wants to attempt the compilation, there is a better
chance it will get done.  Let me know and I will be happy to lend a

Some of the seeming inconsistencies in the message included by Isaacs
in his message are a result of the usual half versus quarter twist
screw.  The reason the writer can see 9 configurations after a single twist
is because he has a different definition of a "single twist".

I also am not sure, but I also think that the counting argument given
here suffers from the some confusion Singmaster had when he computed a
lower bound of 17 htw.  I think, in fact, that a lower bound of 19 htw
results if the argument is executed correctly (Singmaster corrected
himself about this by the fourth edition, I think).  Someone with a
copy of Singmaster handy should look this up.

The 41 move count for Thistlethwaite's algorithm is probably a half
twist count given that it was reported by Singmaster.

Message-Id: <16Sep81 000353 DH51@CMU-10A>

	Hi.  I'm really pressed for time, but I'll drop a couple of
comments.

	Alan pretty well said it--there are half-twisters and there
are quarter-twisters and the included message is one of the former.
I strongly favor the latter, since then all the moves are
equivalent, (M-conjugate, to you archive-readers).  But Singmaster's
book, though in the other camp, is too good to ignore.

	To extend the argument I gave on 9 January to the case
where quarter-twists and half-twists are counted equally (we call
such a move a `htw' whether it is quarter or half) let PH[n] be the
number of (3x3x3-cube) positions at exactly n htw from SOLVED.  Then

	PH[0]  = 1
	PH[1] <= 6*3*PH[0]
	PH[2] <= 6*2*PH[1]   + 9*3*PH[0]
	PH[n] <= 6*2*PH[n-1] + 9*2*PH[n-2] for n > 2.

Solving yields the following upper bounds:

htw        new        total      htw        new         total
 0           1            1       10    2.447*10^11   2.646*10^11
 1          18           19       11    3.267*10^12   3.531*10^12

 4       43254        46756       14    7.769*10^15   8.398*10^15
 5      577368       624124       15    1.037*10^17   1.121*10^17
 6     7706988      8331112       16    1.385*10^18   1.497*10^18

 9 18330699168  19815150304

	At least 18 htw are required to reach all the 4.325*10^19
positions of the cube.  This is the same argument that was used in
Singmaster's fifth edition, p. 34, and is the best I know.  Lest ye
be tempted to pull the trick I did in the January message, remember
that half-twists are even permutations, so there is no assurance
that half the positions are an odd distance from SOLVED.  This is
illustrated in the 2x2x2 case, where more than half of the
positions are at a particular odd distance.

	And yes, all of Thistlethwaite's analysis seems to use the
half-twist metric.  I am quite surprised, however, to hear the rumor
of 41 htw.  As of Singmaster's fifth edition, the figure was 52 htw
``... but he hopes to get it down to 50 with a bit more computing
and he believes it may be reducible to 45 with a lot of
searching.''  If anyone has harder information on the situation, I
would like to hear it.

	Well, back to real work.  I saw a Rubikized tetrahedron in a
shop window earlier this evening; I'm not sure whether I'm relieved
or infuriated that the store was closed for the day.

For months now I have been living in blissful ignorance thinking that I too
could solve "the cube".  To my horror and dismay I have found that my solution
is not complete.  There are some cubes on the market that have pictures of fruit
on the faces rather than solid colors.  I wondered if the solution I use would get
the pictures on the faces all lined up in the proper direction.  I found that it
didn't!  The problem is that some of the center cubies do not line up in the same
direction as all the other cubies on the face.  I am currently working on finding
some macros that rotate the center cubies without affecting the rest of the cube. 
I would suggest that you might find one of these fruit cubes and try it.  Or you
can do as I did and mark the faces of an original cube so that you can tell the
orientation of the cubies.  Good Luck!

Is it possible to make every face have either a Z or an S

	It is impossible to put Z patterns on all six faces of the
cube, just as it is impossible to extend the Laughter (or Zig-Zag)
pattern to six faces.  The problem is with the corners.  If every
face is to have a pair of opposite corners that agree with the face
center and a pair of opposite corners that agree with each other
but not with the center, then the only constructible pattern is
like (i.e. M-conjugate to) the following:

		F - U
		- U -
		U - F

	D - L	F - R	U - R	B - L
	- L -	- F -	- R -	- B -
	L - D	R - F	R - U	L - B

		B - D
		- D -
		D - B

But this pattern has incorrect corner orientation, and so is not
achievable.

	The T patterns were introduced to this list by David C.
Plummer [3 September 1980 2123-EDT], who assigns credit to Tanya
Sienko for the idea.  Jim Saxe and I [27 January 1981 0102-EST] gave
a process for Tanya's T, the pattern that Minh Tai uses to sign
with.  Our process, (FF UU)^3 (UU LR')^2, is four quarter-twists
shorter than Tai's ``quick routine'' because of the cancellation in
the middle.  The other T pattern, Plummer's T, can be achieved in 28

RANDOM COMMENTS:
Some people felt that the reason I might not have gotten
many responses was because of the tediousnes and difficulty
of entering a detailed description of their algorithm and
also transformations they know of.
One person suggested that lack of responses may have been
due to the fact that it is summer, and some people would not
have been at school.
This is the results(or most of them anyway) of the poll up to
this point, but I feel that this should by no means be
considered the end of the poll, please mail any new responses
addition to old responses, or updates of old responses to
CUBE-POLL@MIT-MC. If you need to know the questions, the
POLL is in the archives dated 14 AUG.,3:12EDT, or you could
probably get a copy by asking CUBE-MAIL-REQUEST.
Also feel free to enter any new poll questions into the
discussion by announcing them on CUBE-LOVERS.
I personally will probably be unable to do anything about
new responses until Christmas, but don't let this stop you
from sending them in.

I hope that i have not grossly misrepresented anybody
because of my abbreviations of the results.

Reagans's economist, then smashes off a corner or two of the cube
with a hammer.  In the last frame, he has his suit jacket back on
(which he had lost while struggling).  He holds up a solved cube
and says, "Simple... I just applied my economic method...

Just a clarification (and a discussion promoter, perhaps).  I can
believe it is possible to put the center 2x2 blocks of a 4x4x4
cube into any relative position.  But, there is still only one
way to solve it.  This is because the relative position in the
solved state is determined by the corners.  I guess this allows
for a new class of pretty patterns, especially DOTS:
	DOTS as we know it in  the 3x3x3 (two sets of three; one
	  set clockwise, the other couterclockwise) 
	DOTS (two sets of three; both (counter)clockwise)
	DOTS (two sets of three; similar to BASEBALL)
	DOTS (three sets of two; like Christman's Cross)
	DOTS (three sets of two; pairs opposite) (a local max)
	DOTS (three sets of two; all pairs adjacent)
	DOTS (one set of six; similar to the checkboard obtained
	  by Plummer's Cross + dots + pons)
	etc.

Here are two arrangements in the orbit where one corner is twisted

The following observations speed the search:
 1) The 3*3 Latin square whether reduced or not must be some

 2) The diagonal bars of the squares must be arranged as in
    the pretty pattern called "Laughter" because of the shape
    of the corner cubies.  (See the bars in the patterns above.)
 3) When you attempt to place one of the remaining four corner
    cubies, the corner color propagates to two edges which restricts
    the other color on those edge cubies to not be that color and also
    not that color's complement (e.g. U and D).  This restriction
    then propagates to another corner.

It so happens that cubists like to do it faster instead of
slower.  Or by twisting faces.  There are those who allege that
anyone who would try and try to solve the dumb puzzle is sick, or
that anyone who would solve and scramble a cube tens of thousands
of times is sick.  Lots of people can't imagine anyone finding

I have constructed a tactile cube by epoxying buttons, snaps, paper
clips and Q-tip stems to a store-bought cube.

It takes me about 20 minutes to solve with my eyes closed as opposed
to about 5 minutes with my eyes open.  Maybe Conway cheats in his
5 look solution by feeling colors.

I minimize search times by always working faces in a fixed order
and by orienting colors (i.e. textures) before moving cubies on the
last face.  But the ability to see (i.e. feel) the back of the cube
doesn't compensate for my as yet poorly developed tactile pattern
recognizer.

  There seem to be at least two high quality cubes, one called "Deluxe" and
I think sold by Ideal for about $14.00 around here (S.F.), the other
packaged differently (in a half-cardboard box) and sold for about $8.00.
Last night I heard that there may be still another version (perhaps identical)
for about $4.00.  Anyway, they all have the colors on the facies put on with
thin plastic squares instead of stickers.  The one I have also turns very well.
But the plastic seems to be what makes them "deluxe".  
   There is also a "build it yourself" cube kit sold; I've seen it, but don't
have one.  It comes with the pieces and screws, and each facie has a small 
hole in the center.  Plastic colored faces are snapped in.  Maybe it is
an early version of the "Deluxe".
   Documents on the cube:  There seem to be more books published on the cube
every day.  Almost all of them are just solutions, with a little extra
information (pretty patterns, anecdotes, other types of cubes, etc.). I
know of not other book as interesting mathematically or theoretically as
Singmasters.  An article by Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, called "The Hungarian
Magic Cube" in Bulletin, The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, Vol. 16, aPril 1980, may have interesting information (I haven't seen it), and
the book? article? by Conway and others, mentioned in Singmaster, ought to
be interesting if/when it comes out.

Following Rob's question about bigger cubes I would like to report 
on "Wonderful Puzzler"'s latest: The Rubik Sphere. Yes, it is here
and is about 90mm in diameter with six circular faces. Solving is
hence just as for the cube apart from some confusion caused by the
fact that there are no edges to hold onto, the thing has no distinct
orientation. This also makes twisting a bit tricky and I would think
those 24 second champions would have trouble with this one. The ball
or sphere has a smaller brother (keyring size) and this one has a
different coloring scheme, "stripes" instead of "faces" and is in
this respect very similar to the 10 sided drum discussed here earlier.
The mechanics of the sphere is very much as you would expect, just
an extension of the original cube mechanism,- or if you like: imagine
heating your cube up to near melting point and squeezing it into
a ball (not recomended!)

Happy.. eh, well Sphering!

(1) [] [] [] <- turn this slice 45 deg
    [] [] []

Subject:  Brute Force Report: The fourteen-qtw identities
Message-Id: <07Dec81 191129 DH51@CMU-10A>

	Several messages in August of this year [mail to
Hoey@CMU-10A for copies] concerned short identities of the cube,
i. e. processes which return the cube to solved.  Later in that
month I assisted David Plummer in a brute force attack on the
problem.  We had plans to investigate all the positions up to eight
qtw, but unfortunately became busy on other projects.  I have
finally come up with enough time to analyze and report the data
from the seven-qtw search.

	There are 8,221,632 cube positions at a distance of seven
quarter-twists from solved, and 9,205,558 positions at seven or
fewer qtw.  By recording cases of different seven-qtw processes
yielding the same position, a complete list of fourteen-qtw
identities is obtained.  The task is then to reduce the list to
exclude multiple instances of equivalent identities.

	We call two identities equivalent when one can be obtained
from the other by some combination of the following operations:

	- uniformly relabeling the twists according to a rotation
		or reflection of the cube,
	- cyclically permuting the twists,
	- reversing the order of the twists and inverting each one,
		and
	- substituting a sequence x for a sequence y, where xy' is
		a shorter identity.

The first three criteria are easily implemented on a computer.  The
fourth can be performed for the shortest identities, those
equivalent to F^4 and FBF'B', but I know of no algorithm to detect
all cases of equivalence due to substitution of the longer
identities.  My strategy was to reduce the (several thousand)
identities by computer for the simple kinds of equivalence, and
then to look by hand for substitution equivalence between the
fourteen identities then remaining.  I found three equivalences,
listed at the end of this note, but the possibility remains that
some of the following identities are equivalent.  The list is,
however, complete (modulo bugs and cosmic rays).

	Identities equivalent to the first six on this list were
independently discovered by Chris C.  Worrell; I follow his
numbering for them.  Identities I14-5 through I14-7 do not hold in
the Supergroup, because they twist face centers as noted in the
brackets.

I14-1   BF' UB'U'F UL' BU'B'U LU'
I14-2   B UBL' B'D'BD LB'U' L'B'L
I14-3   BB U BB UD' RR U' RR U'D
I14-4   BUB'U' L'FL UBU'B' L'F'L
I14-5   (BB UD B U'D')^2                    [Supergroup BB]
I14-6   BF' U B'F  LR' UD' F' U'D  L'R      [Supergroup UF']
I14-7   BF  U B'F' LR' UD  F' U'D' L'R      [Supergroup UF']
I14-8   BF' UFRU'R'B'U'B'RBUR'
I14-9   BF' UFRU'B' UD' F'U'R'FD
I14-10  (BUBU'L'B') R (BLUB'U'B') R'
I14-11  (BUBU'L'B') D'R'B' DLD'RD

	The twelve-qtw identity I12-2 = (BUBU'L'B') (B'D'B'DLB) can
be substituted into identities I14-10 and I14-11 to yield:

I14-10a  (B'L'D'BDB) R (BLUB'U'B') R'
I14-10b  (BUBU'L'B') R (B'D'B'DLB) R'
I14-10c  (B'L'D'BDB) R (B'D'B'DLB) R'
I14-11a  (B'L'D'BDB) D'R'B' DLD'RD

Identity I14-10c can be obtained from I14-10 [by shifting seven
places and reflecting the cube through the UD plane] but I14-10,
I14-10a, and I14-10b are mutually inequivalent when twelve-qtw
identities are ignored.  The same holds for I14-11 and I14-11a.
Strangely enough, I14-11a can also be transformed to I14-11 by
substituting with the identity (BDBD'R'B') (B'U'B'URB), which is
equivalent to I12-2.

I picked mine up at a Waldenbooks.  It includes a complete solution for the

I just got my first look at a borrowed copy of Nourse's new 
"solve everything" book, specifically to look at the barrel puzzle 
solution he gives.  His notation is:

The two rotating pieces are "rings".  
They rotate through 5 "notches".

"Layers" (horizontal slices containing 5 balls each) are 
numbered 1 thru 4 from bottom to top, plus T for the 3 
balls immediately under "plungers" (when they are up).  
No notation is used for positions within the puzzle, 
except this numbering of the layers.  Positions are given 
by word descriptions or drawings.  

Moves: 

Up-arrow         move the plungers up
Down-arrow       move the plungers down
Two boxes, one above the other, which represent movement 
of the two rings.  A "T" above, or inverted "T" below the boxes 
shows the current plunger position.  Each box may contain:
	blank           don't move this layer at all
	Left-arrow      rotate the ring left (clockwise, as seen from the top) one
notch
	Left-arrow 2    rotate the ring left two notches
	Right-arrow     rotate the ring right one notch
	2 Right-arrow   rotate the ring right two notches

All moves assume the lonesome plunger is toward the puzzle solver.  
All move sequences begin assuming the plungers are in the up position.  

There is a great deal of room for improving this notation.  
Particularly, the boxes should be dispensed with in favor of 
some single-printed-line way of differentiating between top 
and bottom rings.  The current plunger position is not needed.  
Because many terminals or typewriters do not have four 
directional arrows in their character sets, these should be 
replaced.  I like thinking in terms of left and right rotations 
rather than clockwise, since this puzzle is usually solved 
without turning the puzzle as a whole.  Position notations 
are needed.  For these reasons I propose the following: 

Move notations:

U      move the plungers Up
D      move the plungers Down
T      rotate the Top ring right (counter-clockwise from the top) one notch
B      rotate Bottom ring right one notch
-T     rotate Top ring left one notch
-B     rotate Bottom ring left one notch
T2, B2, -T2, -B2 	two notch versions of the above four respectively

Positional notation:

Same naming for "rings", "layers", "notches", "plungers", 
except call the top layer "5".

The ball positions in layer one are, clockwise, as seen from 
the top, beginning with the one under the lonesome plunger: 
1F (front), 1L (left), 1LL, 1RR, 1R.  

Correspondlingly for the other layers.  
There is no 5L or 5R, because of the orientaion of the puzzle.  

During a move, at times when the plungers are down, there 
will temporarily exist positions 0F, 0RR, 0LL.  


Any suggestions or arguments about the notation are welcome.  


Nourse's solution has two typos in it.  Page 33: upper rightmost 
move on page should be in the bottom ring, not top.  Page 36: 
second move on the page should have a 2, not single notch.  


If people are interested, I can summarize Nourse's approach to solving.

Subject: Ten Billion Puzzle (the Barrel)
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

  It just happens that the day before I got the Nourse solution to the
Ten Billion (Barrel, Magic Barrel, etc), I got another solution by Naoaki
Takashima, that he presented to the ARMJ (??) meeting in Japan.  His 
notation:  
Columns and stages are defined             5-   x   x x
as shown on the right.                 s   4- x x x x x
                                       t   3- x x x x x
                                       a   2- x x x x x
                                       g   1- x x x x x
                                       e
                                       s      | | | | |
                                              1 2 3 4 5

                                             columns
He moves the drums, rather than the plunger.
   U--move drums up.       D--move drums down.
   Ru (R sub u) Rotate upper drum right one column; superscripts for number
   Rl (R sub l)   "    lower  "     "    "    "     of columns
   R for upper and lower together to the right
   L for left similarly.

 At any rate, a cumbersome notation for computer writing.  What's more, unit
move people (who don't like slice moves or half turns on the cube) won't like
combining the two drums (rings).  BUT since I hold my barrel by the bottom
plunger, I do find it easier to think of moving the rings up and down, rather
than pushing the plunger.  I like rings better than drums, but columns better
than notches.  And I would rather take standard numbering to start from 
what is above defined as column 2, ie, the one under the neighborless plunger.

  So, all in all, I would like to propose accepting Don Lynns' notation
with the following changes:  U and D would refer to the rings moving up
and down, instead of the plunger.  "Notches" would become "columns".
The picture above, moved to reflect the new columns, could be used when it
is needed for clarity.  

* * * * Small spoiler * *
  The Takashima solution is really based on one move, which cycles 3 balls
more-or-less vertically:
  let X = U T D -T / U B D -B / (TB) U -(TB) D
  then  X2 moves 3F TO 4F TO 2L TO 3F;  ie, the 3-cycle (3F,4F,2L).
* * * * End of small spoiler * * *

 I already propose apostrophe instead of -, so the above becomes:
   UTDT'-UBDB'-(TB)U(TB)'D    which I think is a little clearer.

Notice that the above can be simplified to:
     UTDT'UBDTUB'DT'UBDTUTBD  (I think.  I find it hard to think about in
                               such small pieces; I like the less efficient
                               chunks at first.)
* * * * * * * * SPOILER WARNING * * * * * * * * * * *SPOILER WARNING * * * *

Anyway, with this move alone (plus some playing at the beginning), I can
solve the puzzle as follows:  First get the three black balls at the top,
under the plungers, any old way.  Then put 5 different colors in the first
layer, moving only the bottom ring (to leave the black balls alone).  Then
use the move above to move in the matching second layer from the top (layer
4).  When necessary, use the same move to get from 3 to 4 first, or even from
2 to 4.  Using the inverse move can speed things up, but just doing it twice
is easier on the memory.  Move the space in layer 2 you want to fill, to column
5 (new numbering; col. 1 in above diagram, or "2L" in notation), by moving
the lower ring; move the column containing the ball you want in that space
to col. 1 (F), apply the move once or twice, and move the rings back.  Rest
position has the barrel down (and the plunger up).  Once the second layer
is complete (or, for efficiency, complete except for 1), do similar things
for layers 3 and 4, using the second layer for temporary storage.

* * * * * * * END OF SPOILER * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

  Don Lynn:  I would be very interested if you would summarize Nourse's
approach, and either send it to me or to cube-lovers.  I have not had the
time to break it down into chunks to see what basic moves he really uses.
I find that to be the main trouble with most of the solution books to 
the cube as well as this - that they offer long sequences to memorize, with
little thought to learning what is going on, and what the logic of the moves
are.  In Nourse's solution, what are the basic pieces of his moves. Can they
be expressed (as above) as a "simple to comprehend" set as well as a "shortest
number of unit moves" way.  By use of parenthesis (or maybe slashes), U and D
could probably be eliminated; at each slash, switch from up to down or vice
versa.  Would this be useful notationally.  What are some basic algorithms
to exchange 2 balls on a single layer or in a single column?  To cycle a
layer or column?  
  Enough questions for tonight.  When's the first Barrel contest?

Richard Pavelle has suggested that since cubism seems to be
stagnating, we might consider expanding the scope of this discussion
to include other sorts of puzzles.  He wondered (in a letter to this
list a few days ago) if anyone was interested in the puzzle/book
called "MASQUERADE".  The response he got was enthusiastic.

The discussion on this list has never been exclusively about cubes,
but it has never really strayed very far either.  Also, recently the
discussion has slowed somewhat.  So we were wondering how people would
feel about changing the purpose of this list from cube hacking to more
general puzzle hacking.  This would still be the place to talk about
cubing, but everyone would have to at least tolerate other puzzles as
well.  Note that there is another option for general puzzle hackers
which is the formation of a separate Puzzle-Lovers (or something)
mailing list.  This second option would be the thing to do if there is
enough interest, but also some objections from people currently on
Cube-Lovers.  (If a new list is formed, they will have to find someone
else to be responsible for it.  I won't deal with two!)

To decide this tricky question I would like to hear from anyone who
objects to the expansion idea.  With enough objections, we simply
won't do it.  Don't bother to send me a note if you are simply in
favor of, or don't mind the idea.  I really only need to hear from the
NO votes.  I'd be interested to hear any other thoughts you have on
the subject as well.  Mail to Alan@MIT-MC.

              PUZZLES

I. LIFE
  A. Technical (science, social science, etc)
  B. Psychological (ie, people problems)

II. CREATED
  A. Mental
     1. Language (word) puzzles
        Crosswords, Acrostics, word squares, etc.
     2. Logical puzzles
        Bridge crossing, truth tellers, etc,etc -- all those pencil and
        paper puzzles that appear in most non-word puzzle books.  Mostly
        mathematical.
  B. Physical  (Also sometimes called "Mechanical Puzzles")
     (THESE ARE THE KINDS I AM MOST INTERESTED IN, AND PROPOSE GOING INTO MORE
      DETAIL ABOUT.)
     1. Geometrical (including 2 and 3 dimensions; jig-saws; things like that.)
     2. Topological (rope and string puzzles, that involve deformation.  
                     Possibly including wire puzzles.)
     3. Combinatorial (box filling puzzles; Rubics Cube)
     4. Manipulation (dexterity?) (mazes, rolling balls, ballance puzzles)
     5. Physical? Miscellaneous? (Other types, like puzzle jugs; optical
                                  puzzles, centrifical force.)

I'll try to expand on this classification at a later time - I just want to
get something started now.  You can see that there are many problems in this -
a lot of puzzles don't fit easily in any of these, and others fit clearly into
more than one.  The trouble is that you can look at puzzles by their form, or 
by how they are constucted, or how they are solved.  And no one way seems
satisfactory for all.  Anyway, following is another classification, just
of Mechanical (Physical) puzzles, by Jerry Slocum, who has one of the biggest
puzzle collections in the world.

1. PUT-TOGETHER PUZZLES - Putting the object together is the puzzle
      Tangrams, jigsaw, soma, instant insanity, magic squares, puzzle rings
2. TAKE-APART PUZZLES - Taking the object apart or open is the puzzle
      Trick or secret opening
3. INTERLOCKING SOLID PUZZLES - Disassembly and Assembly is the puzzle
     Burrs, 3-D jigsaws, keychain, geometric object and figures (the Japenese
     wooden puzzles)
4. DISENTANGLEMENT PUZZLES - Disentanglement and entanglement is the puzzle
     Wire puzzles, nails, string and rope puzzles
5. SEQUENTIAL MOVEMENT PUZZLES - Moving Parts of the Object to a Goal While
   Following Rules is the Puzzle
     Solitaire, sliding block puzzles, rotating cube (Rubik) puzzles, maze and
     route.
6. DEXTERITY PUZZLES
     Rolling Ball, cup and ball, etc
7. MISCELLANEOUS 
     Puzzle jugs, folding, paper and card, matchstick, trick, vanish puzzles, 
     optical puzzles, find-the-object, rebus, reversibles, etc.

  I just got a new cube puzzle, called "Color Cube Mental Game".  Not a
Rubik's cube, but still combinatorial, and a lot easier.  It consists
of 8 cubes in a 3x3 box, arranged around the perimeter (so there is a
cubical hole in the center).  The cubes are colored on all 6 sides 
(identically in mine).  They roll by tilting them over an edge to an
adjacent vacant space, and they change colors in doing so.  The puzzle,
of course, is to roll them and randomize the pattern, then restore the
original color (or a new color).  What patterns can be made?  What is the
minimum number of rolls to solve from some pattern to another?  This type
of puzzle was talked about in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, and
similar types in Mathematical Games by Martin Gardner (I can give more
accurate references if anyone wants).  
  Here's the last paragraph on the "instruction" sheet:  "It should be

Subject: nuts
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

There is a puzzle that has been around for several years called
something like "Nuts To You" or "Drives You Nuts" or some variation
thereof.  It consists of 7 hexagonal pieces (each resembling a nut,
hence the name) each with the numbers 1 through 6 inscribed around its
perimeter in some order.  The idea is to play a kind of hexagonal
dominoes with these pieces; a solution is found when all 7 pieces are
arranged in a hexagon (the puzzle comes complete with a hexagonal
frame for arranging them, it also resembles a nut) such that every
pair of adjacent pieces are labeled the same along their common edge.
For example one piece might look like this:

   _____
  /  6  \
 /3     1\
/         \
\         /
 \2     5/
  \__4__/
                                6
which I shall abbreviate by:  3   1
                              2   5
                                4

which might participate in the following solution:

           5
         6   4
   6     1   2     3
 3   1     3     2   4
 2   5     3     1   6
   4     5   1     5
   4     2   6     5
 5   2     4     6   1
 3   1     4     3   2
   6     1   3     4
         5   2
           6

Each piece can be rotated (of course), but it cannot be flipped over.
(This restriction is enforced by simply not printing the numbers on
the other side!)

The seven pieces I have represented in my sample solution are
definitely NOT the ones that make up the commercially sold puzzle.  I
don't have that anymore, I just made these up.  It did have the
property that no two pieces were alike, just like my hypothetical set.

The commercial set of pieces seemed to have the property that there
was JUST ONE possible solution, although I cannot be 100% certain that
this was the case.

Now the puzzle itself is a bit dry.  But what I wonder about is the
following meta-problem:

Given that there are many (how many?) different sets of 7 pieces that
can be chosen, how "interesting" a property is it for there to be only
ONE solution?  Do you have to try hard to achieve that property?  Or
do most of them have it?  Indeed, do ANY of the have it (remember I
only SUSPECT that the commercial set has it!).

How about if we relax the restriction about duplicate pieces?

I know of no books about the pyramid, but I can vouch for the fact
that the pyramid is much easier than the cube.  I have essentially ONE
tool that is sufficient for all manipulations.  It isn't even a very
long one.  It is in fact such an obvious tool to try that many people
have discovered it independently.  I'll tell you what it is after I
insert the following spoiler warning:

*** SPOILER WARNING !!! ***  If you wish to solve the pyramid
yourself, stop reading now!

First off, notice that the points of the pyramid can be rotated
independently of all the other pieces.  Thus we can safely ignore
those pieces and simply twist them into position as the last step.  So
from here on in, when I say to twist about a particular point, I mean
to grasp the larger sub-pyramid that shares that point with the entire
pyramid and rotate it.  This motion always leaves the face opposite
the designated point fixed.  

This is not analogous to the way we think about the cube.  When
dealing with the cube we rotate a face, leaving the rest of the cube
fixed.  When dealing with the pyramid I am proposing to always rotate
everything BUT a face, a move that arranges to leave the four points
in the same position.

Having how described what I mean by a move, the actual tool is easy.
It's only four twists long.  Chose any two points, call them A and B.
The tool is simply AB'A'B.  It permutes three edge pieces that share
a common face, it flips two of those pieces over, and everything else
is untouched.

Since everything except the edge pieces can be placed in position
trivially (both the point pieces and the third kind of piece I haven't
mentioned yet), this tool might be sufficient (after arranging
everything else).  I don't know if it is in fact sufficient since I
also employ some conjugates (like CAB'A'BC') in my solution.

I leave the details of actually applying this tool for you to
discover by yourself.

I've seen the "Nuts" puzzle; I think it is indeed "Drive you nuts",
but I'm not sure.  I seem to recall that not every (any?) piece
had all six numbers on it; that is, I think one or more numbers
were duplicated on one or more pieces.  This of course opens up
the search space even more in trying to find a set of pieces with
exactly one solution.  Also, rather than consider which sets
of pieces (or what fraction of possible sets of pieces) have unique
solutions, I think it makes more sense to choose a solution and see
how likely it is that the pieces forming that solution have another
solved orientation (other than trivial rotations of the whole puzzle).
That way you at least eliminate all the sets that have NO solution.

Well, my memory is very clear on the point that each nut had all 6
numbers since my solution depended on that fact.  But sure, if we can
answer your extended problem all the better.

You mention rotations as a symmetry of a solution, which reminds me of
another kind of symmetry that is relevant to exactly what is meant by
"a set of nuts".  Clearly the values of the integers inscribed on the
pieces have no effect of the character of the solution.  If someone
broke into your house one night an erased all the 1's and replaced
them with 2's and replaced all the 2's with 1's, they wouldn't have
damadged your puzzle in any way (ignoring that you may have memorized
the solution by number, but that's your fault for chosing a bad way to
remember the solution).  So applying any of the 6! permutations of 6
things to the numbers leaves your "set of nuts" fixed (relative to
eachother).  The manufacturers's choice of numbering is thus at least
partially arbitrary.

Nourse's new book "The Simple Solutions to Cubic Puzzles" has a pyramid
solution.  Aside from the (almost) obvious stuff about the little and big portions
of each corner, it has specific macros for moving edge pieces from any edge
position to the top-front (he solves it with a flat surface up), and for flipping an
edge in place (actually a pair of edges, but the second one is by design an edge
not yet solved).  Then there are two macros that jumble the edges of the bottom
large corner until it is right.  The solution is simple to follow as a cookbook
operation, but not so simple to memorize, involving several macros rather than
one or two that many people are using.

  The numbers on my "Drive Ya Nuts" are as follows (starting from 1 and reading
clockwise: 123456, 143652, 162453, 164253, 165432, 165324, and 146235.  As you
can see, each "nut" is unique.
  There are several related puzzles, including:
  "Japanese Mind Bender", which is logically identical to "Drive Ya Nuts", e
except it used colors instead of numbers, and each hexagon looks like a small
circus tent.
  "Super Dominos", 4x6 squares, each divided diagonally into four sections, and
colored in all possible ways with 3 colors (yellow, orange, and brown).  Object
is to arrange the squares in a 4x6 array, with adjacent edges of matching
colors, and the border to be only one color.  It claims there are about
12000 different solutions, a computer generated number.  I find it difficult to
find even one.
  "Colored Squares Puzzle", A magnetic version of Super Dominos.  They also
suggest a second puzzle as above, but with 2 colors around the edge.
  "Colored Triangles Puzzle", also magnetic (a match for "Colored Squares"),
this one has the 3 colors on 24 triangles, arranged in a hexagon.  Same problem,
though.
  "Try Nine" is octagonal pieces with numbers (similar to "Drive Ya Nuts"),
to be arranged in a 3x3 lattice such that numbers match vertically, horizontally
, and diagonally.  That is, the square spaces between the octagons have opposite
 edges with the same number.
  "Square Crazy" or "Le Carre fou! fou!", a new puzzle from Montreal (If
anyone wants one, I can give you the address).  It is 9 cardboard square
"cards", each of which has half a fish on each edge (either the head or the
tail), and each fish is one of 3 or 4 colors.  So direction and color has to
match up at each edge of the 3x3 square.  I met the inventer, and he says
he used a computer to ensure there is only one solution.
  "Its Knot Easy" has 16 square plastic pieces to be arranged in a 4x4 array,
so that the picture of a rope running through the pieces forms a continuous loop.
  And many more.  Including a dodecahedron whose faces turn, to try to get a
continuous loop running through it, and a version of 3x3 squares which uses
heights instead of colors.
  I think all the "Instant Insanity" type of puzzles are also related to this.
What we need are some non trial-and-error methods of solution, as well as
algorithms to tell if the solution is unique.  
  By the way, I am planning to make a Rubik's cube with 9 colors, with a
solution having 9 different colors on each face.  The question is, how to 
design it so it is solvable (preferably not just by trial-and-error), and
so there is a unique solution.

  How should we do this?  List all the things we see? By "chapter", or
in some other order.
  I don't have my book here right now, so I will start from memory, by 
listing some of the obvious, just to make sure we all start from the
same place.  
  1. Each picture has a hare in it.  Sometimes hidden, sometimes in the open.
     I've always wondered if some of the obvious hares also have a second, 
     hidden one somewhere.  The man in the rabbit ears and with rabbit feet
     bothered me the most.
  2. Each picture has around the outside edge, letters in red, which can
     be re-arranged to make some appropriate word.  In addition, there are
     letters marked with a spike, which form a second word.
  3. Several of the chapters have riddles; I think I know the answers to all
     but one.
   Besides these characteristics of each picture, there are many symbols.  We
should just start to make a list of what they are, and guesses as to what they
mean.  Again, I don't have my book handy, but two examples:
  1. Many pictures have a number square.  What is its' significance?  If I 
remember correctly, all but one of them were missing the same number.
  2. In one of the pictures, the moon(?) has her fingers arranged to say
"love" in sign language.

  Somebody should put in the answers to the riddles and pictures in 1-3 above;
just to have them on record, and to make sure we all agree.

Masquerade is still on my stack, but actually I've come across another
amusement which has been taking up my time during the last couple of
weeks.  Does anybody know about the St. Valentine's Day Massacre?
It is a cross-country road rally which takes place on paper--the Rand McNally
road atlas to be precise.  You are given hundreds of very detailed and
tricky instructions and puzzles as you make your way from the Golden Gate
Bridge to the Statue of Liberty.  You must answer questions along the
way about what you see, time and distance between various points, etc.
I've found the whole thing to be a lot of fun and quite challenging, even
though the entry fee was $24.00 (includes a copy of the Road Atlas).
Trophies will be given out in 3 different classes of competition (Class C=
first timers, Class B= previous participants, Class A= Previous trophy
winners).

If anybody is interested, I'll be happy to provide more info--deadline for
entry is Feb. 14, answers must be sent in by March 1.

Also, I'd like to hear from anybody already involved if they'd like to
compare notes, etc.

P.S.  Alan--go ahead and forward to Cube-Lovers if you wish.

Several people have inquired about this further, so I thought I'd go
ahead and send more info to the group...


Write to:

	St. Valentine's Day Massacre
	P.O. Box 53
	La Canada, CA 91011

Since time is short, you may want to give them a call between noon and
3PM PST at (213)790-4937.  Deadline for entering is Feb. 14.

For $24, they will send you the Rand McNally Road Atlas, and a 50-page
booklet with all of the rules, course instructions, questions, and
answer sheet.  Here's a sample of what it's like:

1.  Begin the 1982 St. Valentine's Day Massacre at the interchange
north of the Golden Gate Bridge (NC-19 on page 11), where you find
two cars from which to choose your first Massacre conveyance:
a 1960 Falcon and a 1930 L-29 cabriolet.  Hmmm: Ford or Cord.
Ponder the selection for something under a second, then hop in and
head south on state highway.

   Q1.  How many "San Gregorio"s do you see?

	a) 0	b) 1	c) 2

2.  Left on 152

    Q2.  How many of these do you see?

		Bell
		Bells				a) 0	d)3
		Bell's Station			b) 1    e)4
		"Bells Station"			c) 2

3.  South onto 33.

     Q3.  Do you see Devils Den?		a) yes   b) no

4.  Left on 58

     Q4.  How many of these do you pass?

		Calloway
		Oak				a) 0   b) 1  c) 2

5.  South on 99

6.  Southeast on Intersate 5

     Q5.  Which of these do you see first?

	   a)  Los Angeles    b) Burbank    c) Gorman
- - - - - - - -


By the time you start answering these questions, you will have read
through the 6 pages of rules which spell out VERY PRECISELY just what
it means to "see" something (be within 1/4 inch of it on the map),
the difference between going ONTO a highway and ON a highway, and
the difference between "Bell" and Bell.  The course following rules
can be very tricky, telling you when to try to stay on a given road,
when you can turn, when you can switch maps, when to start and stop
consideration of a given question, etc.

Later in the course you will be given various puzzles (visit all 6
National Monuments in 4 Arizona counties by travelling only on U.S.
and state highways with no U-turns, for example.)  At one point you
actually travel by balloon at 120,000 feet--this turns out to be about
1 inch above the paper for purposes of "see"!  The instructions are
filled with various tricks and traps which will take you miles off
course if you're not careful.  But they are also cleverly constructed
to eventually get you back on the right track again so that you don't
realize your mistakes.  One of their favorite tricks is exemplified by
Question 5 above: you're tempted to say Gorman since it is north of
L.A., until you realize that you see Los Angeles COUNTY first!

They give you plenty of help on the first leg so that you get an idea
of what it's all about.  You can stop after 4 legs and compete for the
Class C trophies, or else go onto legs 5-7 to try for a Class B
trophy as well as one for Class C.  Legs 8 and 9 are for the Class A
trophies, and are the hardest of all.

I've entered a couple of similar contests put on by the same people
(The Great Maltese Circumglobal Trophy Dash) and even though they're
a little slow with scoring and sending results, I've found them to
be very fair and reasonable.  As soon as the contest deadline passes,
they will send you an answer booklet with a complete explanation of
the entire course and reasons for each answer.  You then have the right
to challenge their reasoning if you disagree with an answer.  If they
agree with your challenge, they will eliminate that question from the
scoring.  After the protest period ends, they do the final scoring,
sending out a complete list of scores for all participants as well
as trophies.  The top 10% in each class all get something, which
gets progressively fancier for the higher percentiles and classes.

Depending on how careful you are, you can expect to spend anywhere
between 30 and 100 hours if you complete the whole course.
Personally I find the entry fee a little high, but considering the
free road atlas and the number of hours of tortu...er, entertainment,
I guess it's worth it!

If you have any other questions, let me know.

Subject: MAGIC OCTAHEDRON
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

  The Magic Octahedron (Octahedron Cube?) is out.  A friend got one for me
over the weekend.  Each face is 9 triangles; it works sort of like two
tetrahedrons base to base, except each tetra is really a 4-sided pyramid.
The solution is not too hard, and not too different from the tetrahedron.
Like the tetra, the corner and next-to-corner pieces don't travel-they
only twist.  The remaining edges are isomorphic to the edges of a cube.
In fact, if you corner-center a Cubes coloring (ie each face has 4 colors,
each corner has one; see the Scientific American article), and then peel 
off the labels from the corners, you have an exact isomorphism of the
Octahedron.
   By the way, this version twists around the corners, using the same
type mechanism as the original Cube (I think).  It should be possible to 
use the mechanism of the Tetrahedron (with its 4 axes of rotation) to 
build an Octahetron whose faces twist.  Any mechanical engineers out there
to do so?

Diferent versions of Icosahedra and dodecahedra; a triangular prism, a cube
cut along the three planes that make hexagonal cross-sections, etc. I
have high hopes that they will be available in this country soon.
   We need a name for this type of puzzle.  Clearly, "Cube" is not
very satisfactory any more - not with spheres, tetrahedra, octahedra, etc.
"group theory puzzles" is too broad - it also includes sliding block
puzzles and others.  Perhaps something like "Axial" or Axially Rotation
or some such.
   David Singmaster is publishing a "Cubic Circular" (nice name) now.  If
anyone wants his address, I'll be glad to supply it.  He will also be

ALAN thinks we should solve the beast before we actually get one.
This could done in our heads, on paper, by machine assistance, or

all the necessary tools to do it.  It is not as easy as saying,
"Well if we just consider these two planes as one, it looks like
the 3x3x3, and..."  That doesn't work for the majority (the
hardest parts) of the puzzle, for reasons I'll be happy to
explain.

Before people start asking a lot of questions about the
properties of the 4x4x4, they should look in

with raised dots. His "Cubic Circular" as mentioned by Stan, is well
worth getting, as it contains alot of interesting information.

A Marketing Consultant from IBM gave me a cube which has IBM4331
printed on all the six center faces and the words: Value,Function,
Support,Reliability,Performance,Productivity on each facie of each
face respectively. The orientation of the IBM 4331 relative to the
other 8 repeated words on each face makes it a supergroup variety.
In my opinion, this cube is the best product to come from IBM in

To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC

    I should think you could solve a 4x4x4 cube by applying 3x3x3 moves, using
different combinations for the "center slice" - ie, rotating the center
two slices together allows all the regular corner moves; it also allows
switching adjacent edge pieces (in pairs) by using whatever you use to flip
edges in 3x3x3.  Using only one of the center slices as "center", and 
turning the other with a face should allow flipping a pair of L-R pieces,
so that L becomes R and vice versa.  The center 4 pieces (which I haven't
thought about carefully) probably can be changed around at
(even parity) will, sometimes treating them as edges (since they can be
carried along on certain of the "edge" moves), and sometimes as centers
(for instance, to rotate a group of 4 of them halfway around in place).
   I don't know what new parity limitations exist; nor do I know if
the same type of sequences are efficient for solving (ie, top-middle-bottom,
etc), but I shouldn't think the new cubes will be so very much more
difficult.
   I would assume the 5x5x5's could be handled similarly, except, of course,
they have a real center.

NO, NO, NO !!!!  You CANNOT treat 1 of the center slices of a
4x4x4 as a center of a 3x3x3.  Suppose you did this for one axis,
and for the other two axes you treated both "centers" as a unit
(and therefore the center slice of a 3x3x3).  Now take one of the
axes with a double width center, and rotate an outer slice 180
degrees.  Suppose the front face looked like this:

	+####+####+####+####+
	#    #    #    |    #
	#    #    #    |    #
	+####+####+####+####+

	#    #    #    |    #
	#    #    #    |    #
	+####+####+####+####+

You rotate the top slice and the front face now looks like:

	+####+####+####+####+
	#    |    #    #    #
	#    |    #    #    #
	+####+####+####+####+

	#    #    #    |    #
	#    #    #    |    #
	+####+####+####+####+

Notice that the top layer does not go very well with the bottom 3
layers.  The 5x5x5 has similar problems.  

I think the right way to solve both the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 at first
is to use mono-flips.  Once conceptually understood, they are
very powerful and easy to visualize.

	University of Illinois engineering student Daniel Talken
	adjusts the mechanical hands of a robot built by students

	The robot's computer brain can work out the solution in

	minutes to make average 110 moves to solve the puzzle.

The photo shows a guy diddling a complicated machine in which an
unsolved cube is visible.  Eyes are painted on the front of the
machine's support above a bulge that may be functional as well as
vaguely resembling a nose.  No camera equipment is apparent;
presumably they tell the machine how the cube is scrambled, or

  I just got a flyer from Ideal announcing their Rubik's Cube Club,
address Box 72, Hollis, NY 11423, $5.00 for a year.  They also have
"merchandise" (no prices included), including cube shirt, tie, patch,
button, bumper sticker, etc.  They also have a poster with many of
Ideal's cube-related products on it, including the 4**3 (called
Rubik's Revenge), a 2**3, Rubik's Race, Rubik's Challenge, etc.  I
can't tell quite what all of them are.
  Also, there are several new group-theory puzzles on the market (here
or in England), sort of related to the barrel.  Orb-it is a sphere 
with beads that rotate around 4 parallels.  In addition, the whole 
sphere rotates around a meridian, to bring different halves of 
the parallels into contact, changing from 4 separate circles of 
beads to one continuous "spiral", or two disjoint closed paths.
Equator Puzzle is a sphere with 3 intersecting (of course) great
circles, each consisting of 12 squares which move around the circles.
The coloring is into 4 segments, sort of like orange slices.
The Trillion Puzzle (will be available from Ideal) is a cross of colored
pieces, 17 of them, four each of 4 colors plus an extra red piece.
They can be arranged with each arm of the cross monochromatic, or in
4 circles around the center.  "The cross lies in a circle divided into 
3 concentric rings which are independently rotatable, though the outer
ring cannot move when the plunger is pushed in.  The middle ring is 2
pieces wide."  (From the description in Singmasters catalogue). The 
plunger moves one arm (9 pieces) over 1 piece.  About 1 billion 
distinguishable patterns.  And many more - Hungarian Rings, and
Gears, for two.  I also saw some which used polarized light, so
it was hard to tell where the pieces should go.
   The latest cube I've seen has Pac-man and other electronic game
figures on it.
