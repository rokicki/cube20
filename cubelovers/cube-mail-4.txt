Indeed, I have one also.  I thought about solving it for a couple
of months now.  Never wrote anything down, I think I just have a
working knowledge of the types of transforms needed.  It took me
about 1.5 hours to solve it.  I thought I had ALL the necessary
tools, but there is still one tool that alludes me.  It happens
half the time, and when I get it, I try to mess it up just enough
to allow it to be solved again.  As ACW pointed out, most
intuition about edges and centers is WRONG.  The first thing I
tried to the original solved cube was the extended Pons.  Much to
my dismay, it didn't work.  So if you think you know how to
extend your 3x3x3 transforms to the 4x4x4, put your fingers where
your mouth is!!

I played with C^4 and I conjecture that the tools from C^3 are 
sufficient to solve it. I have not completely finished it but I 
think it is just a matter of time. 

One transformation I use repeatedly, in generic terms, is
S = top 180, 2nd slice up or down, top 180, 2nd slice down or up. This
is the verticle slice which is facing you. This is just the move in 
C^3 to move 3 edges in a plane whereas in C^4 the outcome is far more 
complicated.

The steps for C^4 are then
1) Align the centers with a map. Some use of S is necessary.
2) Do all corners as in C^3.
3) Use S repeatedly to position the edges and this is very laborious.
4) Use the C^3 edge flip (Rubik's transformation) to finish it off.

After several hours of C^4 I find C^3 looks like a toy.

I have also been using the tools described by Richard Pavelle as S to
do things to edges on the C^4.  However, there is nothing
that I have found that will flip to edges in place (that is, two
halves of a C^3).

Also, for aligning centers, I have been doing it AFTER edges.
The tools I use do not really map into C^3, and I have not
yet mastered them to the point wwhere I can finish them off. I
sit and stare at the damn thing a lot.  This behavior was
considered strange even at the science fiction convention
that I attended this weekend.

Speaking of strange, what kind of reactions have people
been getting from folks who see one for the first time?  I have
gotten the equivalent of double-takes from ones who do notice a difference.
Most, however, tend to say "Oh, I have a friend who can do that in
X minutes/seconds", in which case you know that they never learned
(or probably even played) to solve.

Subject: solving the 4x4x4x4 cube

Cc: frye at BBN-UNIX

I've managed to solve C4 in a way similar to those mentioned, but using a
different transform.  I solve C3 a little differently than most folk because I
use only one (!) transform to do ALL of the edge work.  On C3 the result of
this transform is (looking at the edges only):
               a                            a
from	    b     c             to      ~d     b
	       d                           ~c

Using it and its inverse and a few simple conjugates of it I can do all the
work that is necessary for the edges.  For me, at least, it has the twin
advantages of 1) being easy to remember (since it is fairly short and there is
only one of it), and 2) it has such bounded consequences that it is easy to
fix a cube without requiring a lot of planning (in the picture above, nothing
that is not shown changes: no other edges, no corners).

Anyhow, since that little move is a favorite of mine, I tried it on C4.  On C3
it comes in two flavors (the move and its inverse, or as it turns out, the
right-handed and left-handed versions).  On C4 it comes in four versions: the
move and its inverse, but each in a `left central slice' and `right central
slice' version.  Now for the fun part:  First off I started ignoring the
centers and I noticed that the move (lets call it `M') only moves around edges
in a single plane.  As I tried to figure out what the damn thing did I
discovered that it is a move of order 5!!!.  I find it truly hard to plan out
what happens when five cubes move around a little orbit, but I'm getting better
at predicting it.  The result is:
from:                       to:
	a   b                           a   b
    c           d                  ~d           e
    e           f                  ~f           g
	g   h                           c   h

With some pain I have been able to use ONLY M (and conjugates and powers of it,
of course) to get all the edges in place.  Then I looked at M a little more to
see what it did with centers.  This one is NOT planar, unfortunately, but is
simple enough to be useful: only two sets of centers are affected.  If you are
doing M on the top (to get the above edge transform), only the top centers and
the rear centers are affected.  And what happens is that there are two disjoint
three-cycles each involving two of the top center cubes and one of the rear
center cubes.  thus, you can easily use conjugates of M to move cubes, one or
two at a time, into place on all of the faces around any particular top.
Voila: done!

An amusing thing about M: since its edge permutation is of order 5 and the
center permutation is of order 3, the damn thing is an order 15 move.

Subject: Reactions to 4^3.
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-AI


Bernie and I have divided the double-takers into three major
classes:

1. "Oh, a four-by-four cube!"

2. "Oh, a four-sided cube!"

(and the best of all)

3. "Oh, a four-dimensional cube!"

One of the contributors to this list inadvertently made
error #3 by calling the 4x4x4 a "C^4".  Which brings me to
an interesting question.  What would a four-dimensional
cube really be like?  Let's just start with a 2x2x2x2.  It
would have sixteen hypercubies, all of the "corner" type.
Each hypercubie presents to the outside world four
three-dimensional hyperstickers.

The 2^4 has eight three-dimensional hyperfaces, presumably
each its own color.  I like the idea of using black and
violet along with the traditional red, yellow, orange,
blue, green, and white.  We can call the hyperfaces Back,
Front, Up, Down, Left, Right, In, and Out.  In is across
the puzzle from Out.  I doesn't touch O, but does touch
all the  other  hyperfaces.

The 2^3 can be seen as two square slabs stuck together.  Of
course, they aren't really "square" since they have
thickness.  A move consists of rotating one of these
squares with respect to the other.

Similarly, the 2^4 is two cubical hyperslabs stuck
together.  Of course, they aren't really cubical since they
have hyperthickness.  A move consists of rotating one of
these cubes with respect to the other.  

While the two slices of a 2^3 can only have four relative
positions, the hyperslices of a 2^4 can have twenty-four
different alignments.  There are twenty-four corresponding
twists.  One is the null twist, which consists of just
sitting and looking at the thing.  (In this case, this is
not such a trivial operation!)  Then there are six
different quarter-twists, as opposed to two in the 3D case.
Then there are, get this, eight "third-twists", which when
repeated three times bring the slice home.  These have no
analog in the 3D puzzle.  The remaining nine twists are
half-twists, three of one kind and six of another.

As in the three-dimensional case, the half-twists and
third-twists are all products of quarter-twists.  If we
regard one of the sixteen hypercubies as fixed (without
loss of generality, if you'll believe that) then there are
twenty-four different quarter-twists in all.  Twelve of
these are inverses of the other twelve, but selecting the
twelve "clockwise" ones is a lot harder than it is in the
three-dimensional case.  My intuition fails me.

I haven't tried to apply the Furst-Hopcroft-Luks algorithm
to this monster.  At most there are 6^15*15! =
4.7*10^11*1.3*10^12 = (very roughly) 6*10^22.  I suspect
that some kind of parity, trinity, or quaternity argument
will reduce this by a factor of two, three, or four.  

Yours with a headache,

Amazing! I log in after working on my cube for an hour or so tonight in
order to announce my solution and I find another solution!

As previously stated, I use S to put edges into place.  This is done to
totality after I have put all of the corners together.

Now comes the hard part - all of the centers.  The tools that I have to work
on centers work on 4 or eight center cubies on opposite faces, plus, on
the 4-cubie swap version, two pair of edge cubies get swapped.  After
having a few edges swap (these are now treated like 3x3x3 edges...),
I usually replace these so I can undo the complex conjugations more
reliably.
Now that I can solve it, I going to search for tools that do finer
things, like double swaps for centers or edges without munging
the other centers or edges.

BTW, I have had the tools all weekend - it has just taken this long to
get the proper perspective in order to set up the proper conjugations...

Has anyone solved the construction problem?  Is Ideal's version similar
to Plummer's design of last December? Who DID do Ideal's version?

Any truth to the rumor (that I just started) that the reason that it has
taken Ideal so long to actually start selling the things was that they
were working on a solution booklet all this time? (They DO offer one)

To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

I solved it after about 10 hours. The very tricky part, as I mentioned
in my last message, is to move the edges about in a plane. I still do
not have a move which moves 3 in one slice (nicely), rather 2 in one slice 
and one in the adjacent slice. This makes the process very time consuming.
I also believe centers first is probably the way to approach it although
it is just a feeling. I think that moving only some of the center cubies 
will require very complicated transformations.

I would guess this cube requires about 10 times more moves than C^3.
Does anyone else care to speculate? I will be surprised if anyone
will ever solve C^4 regularly in under 10 minutes. 

Two questions:
1) Any comments about cube-lube. This cube is massive and needs some.
2) I heard there are about 10^50 configurations, true?

In response to Richard Pavelle's message, there are about 7.4*10^45
color combinations.  See "mc:alan;cube 4x4x4" for more details on the
subject (especially the derivations) by Dan Hoey.

I bought a solution book from my favorite bookstore today. The title is
"The Winning Solution to Rubik's Revenge". It is a sequel to "A Winning
Solution to Rubik's Cube" by the same author (Minh Thai), who is billed
as the U.S. National Champion of the Rubik's Cube-A-Thon.  I assume the
Revenge book is not REALLY a winning solution... at least not yet.

His method is to put all corners together, go for two opposite centers,
then the edges of said centers.  Next he goes for the remaining edges
(numbering eight), and then the last four centers.

He also goes into many patterns, and has developed a notation which I
have not found immediately obvious.  I haven't looked at the book more
than to scan it yet, however.  He does list a few pretty-patterns, none
of which are checkerboards of any sort.

On a different subject, Paul Schauble accidentally found out how to take
apart the 4^3 today - twist an outer layer about 30 degrees so that an
edge of the twisted face is directly over the edge cube that now forms a
corner on the rest of the cube.  Pop out the cube from the outer layer,
twist the face again so that the popped cube's partner is in a similar
position for popping, and then pop it.  The corners now come out fairly
easily.

Unlike Plummer's design, the insides of this beastie is a sphere with
grooves running along it to make a kind of universal joint.  The center
cubies ride in these grooves and hold all of the other pieces in.  We
only took out about a half-dozen cubies because the cube was NOT in an
initialized  state, but closer to a pretty pattern.  I was definitely
not interested in getting it ALL apart in order to get it back together
correctly. (we did it correctly the first try!).  Unlike the 3^3 cube,
the 4^3 does not seem to come apart easily after the first few are out.

I seem to have gone on for a bit longer than I intended.  I will study
the pamphlet (published by Dell/Banbury by the way) and report in more
detail on notation later.

I just noticed that in the section on Cubology, the author lists the
number of "arrangements is something in excess of 3.7*10^45".  Since
Hoey's number is larger, I guess the statement is correct.

"Rubikmania: Lots Of New Twists"
Newsweek, 19 April 1982, pp. 16f

  It has been hurled out of moving buses, dumped into trash mashers and
pounded to bits with blunt instruments.  With more than 43 quintillion
possible arrangements, Rubik's Cube puzzle may be the most infuriating
plaything ever marketed, as well as one of the most popular.  Seven
years after Hungarian architecture Prof. Erno Rubik constructed the
first cube to help his students understand three-dimensional objects,
world sales have passed the 30 million mark.  "It's phenomenal," says a
vice president for the Ideal Toy Corp., which makes the plastic cube
under an agreement with a Hungarian manufacturing company.  "Every month
we pinch ourselves and say it won't last, but the cube is still selling
like nothing else."
  Ideal has capitalized on the cube's success with a number of
spin-offs.  There's Rubik's Revenge, which has sixteen tiles on a side,
instead of nine; Rubik's Pocket Cube, a simpler version intended for
children; Rubik's World, a globe made of 26 sections that twist apart;
Rubik's Game, a three-dimensional pegboard, and Rubik's Race, a
two-player game in which the multicolored tiles must duplicate various
patterns.  True masochists might also want to try something called the
Calendar Cube---which requires twiddling the tiles every day to form the
correct date.
  Rubikmania has also spread to the publishing industry.  Ideal's
solution booklet and another one written by a 13-year-old London
schoolboy ("You Can Do the Cube") are both big sellers.  "The Simple
Solution to Rubik's Cube," which runs to 64 pages, has sold 7 million
copies; it is the fastest-selling title in the history of Bantam Books. 
There are even books for people who are fed up with the craze.  Among
them: "Not Another Cube Book," "You Can Kick the Cube" and "101 Uses for
a Dead Cube."
  Rubik receives about 5 percent of the puzzle profits, making him
perhaps the only self-made millionaire in Hungary.  "With the money I
earn, I can afford to buy myself a new Fiat every two days," he jokes. 
"A little Fiat."  He has taken a leave of absence from his teaching post
to help Ideal organize a world cube-twisting championship in Budapest
this spring.  To qualify for the contest, you must be able to solve the
puzzle in less than one minute---which eliminates Rubik himself.  It
takes him at least twice that long.

  Aauugghh - no one I've been able to find in the Bay ARea has the 4^3.
If anyone is flying in from Boston, BRING SOME!  Several other of
Ideals new stuff is out here - including the game "Rubik's Race", some
of the Puzzle pens, and the 2^3.  The latter uses the sliding disks
on an internal sphere mechanism, by the way.  If one comes apart, it
seems difficult (but not impossible) to get back together. 
  Anyway, the only really worthwhile new Ideal thing is Alexander's
Star, which is a worthy addition to the sliding axis puzzle field.  It
is a Great Dodecahedron in form, and each "star", that protrudes from
a pentagonal face, rotates (5 positions).  Each face (the pentagons, not
the stars) is monochromatic in the solved state.  It is colored with 6
colors, opposite faces the same.  (Look in a decent geometry book for
a picture of a great dodecahedron. It's one of the 4 Kepler-Poinsot
regular concave polyhedra, this one having 12 pentagonal faces 
interpenatrating each other in a star-like manner).  It's not too
hard to solve, the main difficulty is figuring where each piece goes.
(Each moving piece is the triangular wedge which can be found between
the points of a stellated dodecahedron, which "turn it into" a great
dodecahedron).

I take back my statement about solving the cube, also: I do have one transform
that is the product of an order-3 centers-only cycle and an order-5 edges-only
cycle, and I can use that transform to do very nearly everything...except for
one maneuver.  If the normal layout of the edges on one face is:
        a b
      h     c
      g     d
        f e
Then, when I try to solve the cube, once in a while I end up with one of the
following two equivalent forms:
        ~a ~b                 c  b
       h      c     or      h      a
       g      d             g      d
         f  e                 f  e
I have not yet fully determined exactly which of the two identical edges of
each color is where.  In particular, I strongly suspect that the first form
is really `~b ~a' (that is, if you think of the two edges together as a single
C^3 edge, then that edge was flipped), while I suspect that the second form is
correctly rendered.

I have found that if I do sensible things to the cube, I can mostly work until
the cows come home and not fix the thing, but if I screw up a transform and
then have to recover from a somewhat scrambled mess, more often than not it
comes out OK when I get the cube back in shape.  sigh.  right now I'm working
on a group-theoretic analysis to try to get some idea for what type of move or
conjugate I have to be looking for in order to make the thing work out.

   The 4x4x4 cube does indeed have a "parity" problem.  It may be described
approximately thusly:
   Look at one face of the cube.  Number the cubies across one edge as 1, 2,
3, 4.   It can be shown that an edge cubie of type two can be either in
a type 2 position unflipped or in a type 3 position flipped.
   Next, assuming that the top three planes (or slices) are correct, that
the corners of the last face are correct, and that the proper color is up for
all of the edge cubies, then the edge cubies in group 2 and those in group 3
either have the same "parity" or opposite parity.  The parity groups for the
edge cubies are defined as 
            a                           a
	b       d                   b       c
	    c                           d
and any of the twelve variations of each obtainable by one or more rotations
of three elements at a time.  (Each letter represents a different color.)
   When solving the cube, the cubies of group 2 and group 3 will either end up
with the same or opposite parity.  If the parity is the same, the cube can be
solved straightforwardly.  (I assume people have discovered the transforms that
invert the parity of both groups at the same time.)
   However, when the parity is opposing, there is only one "transform" that
will correct the problem.  People accustomed to thinking of a useful transform
as one which performs some limited rearrangement of cubies while leaving
everything basically unchanged will find that none of their transforms is
sufficient to solve the problem.
   Credit goes to Bill Mann for discovering the "transform" that solves the
problem.  I leave it up to him to describe the solution if he wishes to.

I have done a complete search on paper for a complete
checkboard.  It cannot be done for any cobe of even side.  The
restrictions are in the corners.  I would like somebody to double
check this though.  The standard problems to run into are:
	You need two of one type of corner, or
	You have to rotate exactly one corner, which is impossible.

There are a couple other amazing things I found.
As it is known, any two edges can be exchanged (or appear to be
exchaged because of center arbitrariness).  It is ALSO possible
to (appear to) exchange two corners, for about the same reason.
This is impossible on the 3^3 becuase it requires the exchange of
two edges.  But in the 4^3 there are two cubies per 3^3 edge.
Therefore, we just do a double exchange, which does not violate
any parity arguments.  Combining these two moves, you can flip a
1x1x4 edge. 

Happy revenge.

   I shared your frustration.  I'm in L.A., and, upon calling Ideal's office here, I
learned that they are following a rigid schedule of TV ads first before
introducing the toy in any area.  Here in L.A. (and probably in the Bay Area),
the TV ads are not scheduled until mid-June!  Curiously, Minh Thai's solution
book is already in some bookstores here.

   Anyway, I wound up calling Games People Play in Cambridge, and
mail-ordering one ($15 + $2 handling + UPS mailing cost) using a credit card. 
A two-minute transcontinental call before 8 am PDT is about 40 cents.  I hope to
have my Rubik's Revenge in a day or so now.

Subject:  |4^3| = 1.7*10^55
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-AI


The corner group of 4^3 is exactly like that of the 3^3.  It has
8!*3^7 elements.

Now to calculate the order of the whole group, we have to find
the order of the corner stabilizer  group.  That's the group of 
moves that leave the corners fixed.  

SO let's start by thinking about the edge group of the corner
stabilizer.  I personally have a tool that exchanges two edge cubies
without moving corners.  Since the edge group is transitive, I can
exchange any two edges without moving corners.  

You cannot flip any edge of the 4^3 without moving it.  So there's no
edge-flippage in the 3^3 sense on the 4^3.  That means that the edge
group in the corner stabilizer has order 24!.

Now all there is left is compute the order of the edge AND corner
stabilizer.  The inside twists (slices) are center-even.  The outside
twists (faces) are center-odd, but they are also corner-odd, and so if
we want to bring the corners home we have to make an even number of
outside twists.  That means that all the center-permutations in the
edge-and-corner stabilizer are even.  But how many of these can be
achieved?

I have a tool that exchanges two pairs of centers.  I think (but I
haven't yet proved) that the center group is 4-transitive, so that
ANY two pairs of centers can be exchanged.  That means that all the
even permutations of centers can be done without perturbing edges and
corners.  Hence the size of the edge-and-corner stabilizer is 24!/2.

As for supergroupiness, Dave Plummer just pointed out to me that
once you know a center's position, you know its orientation, since
center cubies always keep one corner pointing to the middle of the
face.  So 4^3 has no supergroup.

So the order of the 4^3 group is 8!*3^7*24!*24!/2.  In numbers, if you
insist,

|4^3|=

16,972,688,908,618,238,933,770,849,245,964,147,960,401,887,232,000,000,000

or about 1.7*10^55.

Now that number is a little deceptive, because it includes whole-cube
rotations.  The 4^3 has no nice fixed reference frame like the 3^3 has.
If you don't want to count whole-cube rotations you have to divide by
24, to get

707,195,371,192,426,622,240,452,051,915,172,831,683,411,968,000,000,000

or about 7.1*10^53.

Finally, we have to face the fact that the center cubies are
in six nonintradistinguishable sets of four.  (All the edge cubies are
distinguishable by color or orientation).  So we have to divide our
last result by 4!^6/2.  That leaves

7,401,196,841,564,901,869,874,093,974,498,574,336,000,000,000

or about 7.4*10^45 distinguishable color patterns.  Remember that these
do not form a group.

I leave it as an exercise for Hoey and Saxe to find a lower bound for
the diameter of the group.

Subject: The missing C^4 transform found
To: cube-lovers at mc

I have to admit to not quite yet fully understanding all of the
parity issues involved, however I have managed to apply some VERY
SIMPLE logic to the mysterious transform and since it worked I'd
like to share the insight with you-all. 
As I mentioned in an earlier note I have been trying to do some
analysis to try to sneak up on the missing transform.  Mostly
I've been unsuccessful at fully identifying the parity issues
(my understanding is basically at the same not-so-useful level as
wbe's is: I kind of know that some moves seem to come in pairs and
there are two `classes' of edge cubes and if you interchange one from each
class they both flip... but that mostly didn't help me see what had to be done
to make the `missing transform' happen, nor would it let me look at a scrambled
cube (or even a nearly-done cube) and guess which parity class it was in).

However, I did make one observation: all of my normal transforms contained an
EVEN number of quarter-twists.  I fumbled around a bit to try to find a
limited-change transform that used an ODD number of twists and mostly I
couldn't.  So I decided to simply take the `simplest' odd-twist transform I
could: a single twist!  IT WORKS!!  As far as I can tell it must be a slice
twist (but ANY one), a face twist doesn't do it.  If I get the cube edges all
solved except for a pair that must be flipped, I simply make a SINGLE quarter
slice and then re-solve the cube from there.  Since all of my normal solving
maneuvers are EVEN, when I get the thing solved again I will have preserved the
ODD parity of the configuration, and poof! the edges are solved.

Now to start on the search for pretty patterns and elegant (and short)
operators...

Message-id: <[MIT-DMS].233206>

Cambridge firm seeks $60m in Rubik's Cube suit
By Christy George
Special to The [Boston] Globe [5/27/82]

  Moleculon Research Corp., a Cambridge chemical, research and
development firm, yesterday filed a $60 million patent infringement
lawsuit against the Delaware-based Ideal Toy Corp., which manufactures
and markets the highly-lucrative puzzle known as Rubik's Cube.
  Moleculon holds a 1972 US patent for a similar mathematical cube
puzzle invented by Dr. Larry Nichols of Moleculon.
  The prototype of the Nichols Cube is a 2x2x2 cube held together by
magnets, while the original Rubik's Cube is a 3x3x3 cube held together
mechanically.  However, the 1972 Moleculon patent also lists
specifications for a mechanically-constructed cube as well for cubes of
other varying sizes.  Ideal has no US patent for Rubik's Cube, although
its inventor, Erno Rubik, was issued a Hungarian patent in 1978.
  In its complaint, Moleculon alleges that Ideal "willfully and
maliciously" continued to manufacture and sell Rubik's Cube despite
having been notified a year ago that Moleculon holds the only valid US
patent on the invention.
  According to Moleculon's president, Dr. Arthur Obermayer, the
Cambridge firm unsuccessfully tried to interest Ideal in its cube puzzle
in 1969.  In 1970, the firm applied for a patent at the suggestion of
other national toy manufacturers, who also were uninterested in
marketing the puzzle.
  Lawyers for Ideal would not comment on the pending suit because, they
said, they have not yet received the complaint.  But Ideal's general
counsel, Samuel Cohen, dismissed the notion that Ideal might have stolen
the idea from Moleculon.  "It's ridiculous on its face," Cohen said,
"we're paying heavy sums to the Hungarians for use of their patent.  It
would be stupid to do that if we had it in our pocket all the time."
  Obermayer says the company didn't realize how similar Rubik's Cube was
to the Nichols Cube until the phenomenal success of the product began to
make headlines.  Rubik's Cube was first marketed worldwide in 1980. 
Because of the puzzle's complexity, inventor Nichols wasn't surprised
that toy firms were unimpressed.
  "I'm delighted people enjoy solving the puzzle," Nichols said, "but
I'm also frustrated that neither I nor Moleculon has seen any financial
reward all these years."
  Obermayer is confident of success in the lawsuit, citing the fact that
three prominent patent law firms have agreed to collaborate on
Moleculon's behalf on a contingency basis.
  Moleculon is asking for $20 million in estimated lost royalties and
$40 million in damages, as well as interest on other costs.  Even more
could be at stake in terms of future royalties.
  According to an article in Newsweek magazine last month, annual world
sales for the basic 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, which retails for between $7 and
$8 in the Boston area, have exceeded the $30 million mark.  And the
company also markets a range of spin-off products, including cubes in
three other sizes and types, a Rubik's Cube solution booklet, a Rubik's
Cube world globe and a Rubik's Cube board game.
  "Sales are just incredible," said Carol Monica, owner of the Cambridge
store, The Games People Play.  Monica said she already has sold more
than a hundred of Ideal's latest spinoff, a 4x4x4 verison of Rubik's
Cube which costs $16 and went on the market only three weeks ago.
  Ironically, in an action pending before the International Trade
Commission, Ideal claims it is besieged by countless "knockoffs" of
Rubik's Cube by unscrupulous foreign competitors.  The Delaware company
is asking the commission to squelch international imports of similar
mathematical puzzles.

OK, it's been some time since I pointed out where I keep archives and
things...  Old cube-lovers mail is archived in the following places: 

MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL0	;oldest mail in forward order
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL1	;next oldest mail in forward order
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL2	;more of same
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL3	;still more of same
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL	;recent mail in reverse order

(Files can be FTP'd from MIT-MC without an account.)

In addition, I have the following two excerpts from the archives sitting on my
directory since they contain some of the more asked-for material:

MC:ALAN;CUBE 4X4X4	;Contains some pre-release speculations on the 4x4x4
			;cube.  Some are out of date, but it contains the only
			;analysis this list has seen of the 4x4x4 group, I
			;believe.
MC:ALAN;CUBE S&LM	;While most of the speculation about the diameter of
			;the 3x3x3 group is scattered randomly through the
			;archives, this file contains the single message with
			;the highest content.  Hoey and Saxe's message on
			;Symmetry and Local Maxima.

To briefly remind you all of ALL that we know about the diameter of the 3x3x3
group (refered to as "God's number" in many of our discussions):

We know that God's number is greater or equal to 21 quarter twists.
 (See Hoey's message of January 9 1981: "The Supergroup -- Part 2 ..." in MAIL1
 for a good explanation of this, as well as some other interesting bounds.)
We know that God's number is greater or equal to 18 half twists.
 (See Singmaster.)
We know that God's number is less than or equal to 52 half twists.
 (See Singmaster again, this is Thistlethwaite's algorithm of several years 
 ago.  I'll bet it's been improved upon by now.  There is a persistent rumor
 that he was trying for 41.)

We have never bothered to figure out an upper bound on God's number in quarter
twists ("Q"s).  It must be less than 104 Qs because of the half twist result,
but we could probably do better than that if we took the trouble to understand
Thistlethwaite's algorithm.

Proofs of these numbers, and a great deal of other discussion can be found by
sifting through the archives (unfortunately they are spread all throught the
files).  I would urge people to sift through the archives before starting any
new discussions on the subject.

Message-Id: <01Jun82 222052 DH51@CMU-10A>

Well, since you insist, here are my lower bounds for the 4^3.  For
the "colored" 4^3, where only the color pattern matters, some
positions require at least 41 qtw to solve.  For the "marked" 4^3,
where center facets of the same color are distinguished so as to
force a unique home position for each, some positions require at
least 48 qtw.  The proof is in MC:ALAN;CUBE4 LB and is about 5K
characters long.

A qtw of the 4^3 is either a quarter-twist of a face relative to
the rest, or a quarter-twist of half of the puzzle relative to the
other half.  Note that this makes a slice twist into two moves.  I
like this metric because it is consistent with our conventions for
the 3^3.  One of these days I'll explain why I like those
conventions.

		Lower bounds for solving the 4^3 puzzle

In order to prevent counting positions which arise from whole-cube
moves, I do not move the DLB corner.  So the generators I use are
	U1	U1'	R1	R1'	F1	F1'
	U2	U2'	R2	R2'	F2	F2'
	U3	U3'	R3	R3'	F3	F3'
where the digit indicates how many layers are being moved and the
prime indicates a counterclockwise quarter-twist.

Let us break up any process into "syllables", where a syllable is a
maximal nonempty string of generators with the same letter.  Note
that the order of the generators within a syllable is irrelevant.
We may make a syllable canonical by simplifying so that
	1. A generator and its inverse do not both appear,
	2. Clockwise generators appear at most twice,
	3. Counterclockwise generators appear at most once, and
	4. Generators appear in numerical order.

For each letter there are 63 canonical syllables.  Omitting the
letter, they are:

1,1',2,2',3,3'				Six of length one

11,12,12',13,13',1'2,1'2',1'3,1'3',22,
23,23',2'3,2'3',33			Fifteen of length two

112,112',113,113',122,123,123',12'3,
12'3',133,1'22,1'23,1'23',1'2'3,1'2'3',
1'33,223,223',233,2'33			Twenty of length three

1122,1123,1123',112'3,112'3',1133,1223,
1223',1233,12'33,1'223,1'223',1'233,
1'2'33,2233				Fifteen of length four

11223,11223',11233,112'33,12233,1'2233	Six of length five

112233					One of length six

(Exercise for the reader:  There is a reason these are binomial
coefficients.  Why did we skip a row?)

The number of canonical syllable strings containing N generators is

P(-N) =  0 if -N < 0,
 P(0) =  1,
 P(N) =  6 C(N-1) P(N-1) + 15 C(N-2) P(N-2) + 20 C(N-3) P(N-3)
      + 15 C(N-4) P(N-4) +  6 C(N-5) P(N-5) +    C(N-6) P(N-6)
	   if N > 0,

where C(N) is the number of ways of choosing a new letter after N
generators:  C(-N) = 0 if -N < 0, C(0) = 3, C(N) = 2 if N > 0.

Evaluating this recurrence yields
P( 0)=       1    P(13)<1.338E15    P(26)<1.404E30    P(39)<1.472E45

P( 5)=  763506    P(18)<8.009E20    P(31)<8.400E35    P(44)<8.811E50

P(12)<9.352E13    P(25)<9.810E28    P(38)<1.029E44    P(51)<1.080E59

The number of positions exactly N qtw from SOLVED is at most P(N),
so the number of positions within N qtw of SOLVED is at most
P(0)+P(1)+...+P(N). Since there are 7.07E53 marked and 7.40E45
colored positions, this would give us lower bounds of 40 qtw for
the marked cube and 47 qtw for the colored cube.

But we can improve these lower bounds by one each, using the parity
hack I described some time ago.  Every qtw is an odd permutation of
the corner cubies, so the number of positions with even corner
permutations within 2N+1 qtw of SOLVED is at most
P(0)+P(2)+...+P(2N) and the number of positions with odd corner
permutations within 2N+2 qtw of solved is at most
P(1)+P(3)+...+P(2N+1).

There are 3.70E45 colored positions with odd corner permutations,
and fewer than 1.583E45 odd-length canonical processes with length
at most 39.  So some odd colored positions require at least 41 qtw
to solve.

There are 3.53E53 marked positions with even corner permutations,
and fewer than 1.939E53 even-length canonical processes with length
at most 46.  So some even marked positions require at least 48 qtw
to solve.

		Directions for future hacks

Note that we could also distinguish between positions with even or
odd edge permutations.  The recurrence gets hairier, but my
analysis of that problem indicates that the numbers get very close
very quick, so no luck.

We could divide the positions into buckets based on other quotients
of the group.  For instance, count the number of positions with
each of the 729 possible corner orientations.  This should be
feasible, but probably no help for the 4^3 puzzle.  For the 3^3,
where there are 2187 corner buckets, some of which stay empty for a
fair number of moves (I seem to recall 8), and our current lower
bound is small, I think there is a chance of improvement.  Any
God's numerologist willing to hack the good hack?

There was a report on the Moleculon suit on WCVB, including a closeup
of the patent's picture page. The picture is of a 2x2 cube with the
cubies held together by magnets (the patent shows how the magnets are
to be arranged so the object will hold together).  The inventor of the
"Nicholls Cube" was shown working it.  It doesn't turn; you pull it
apart, turn it, and then stick it back together.  He never quite
claimed to have made a 3x3 version, and carefully tried to fudge the
distinction between his 2x2 frob and Rubik's 3x3.

My impression was that the guy is a sleazo trying to get an out-of-court

  Well, I finally got one (UPS from Boston).  I agree with the preceding

and work out a couple of variations to get edge halves together; then
if a 2-edge monoflip or exchange is left over, do an odd slice move and

Subject: 4x4x4 mechanics
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

I had a small accident the other day.  I dropped Dave Plummer's 4x4x4 cube and
broke one of the center cubies (sorry about that Dave).  This gave me an
opportunity to closely examine the insides of the beastie.  I can't possibly
describe it through the mail (I can barely describe it in person), but there is
an interesting problem raised by the insides:

Inside of a 4x4x4 cube is a 57th piece.  It is not permanently connected to any
of the cubies.  (The center cubies are free to slide back and forth in slots
cut in the center piece.  The rest of the cubies are held in by the centers.)
It is impossible to determine by examining the outside of a cube exactly what
orientation the center piece has.  However, it IS deterministic how the center
piece will move under a certain twist.  When twisting a face, the center piece
stays fixed with respect to the other 3 layers of the cube.  When doing an
"equatorial" twist, the center piece can follow only one of the halves of the
cube (as determined by it's orientation).  (I believe I have just constrained
things enough so that you can figure out exactly how the thing moves on your
own.) 

Thus there is an even larger permutation group to the 4x4x4 (beyond the
supergroup problem where the identities of the center cubies are considered)
that includes the center piece.  Call this the "hypergroup".  And since the
center piece has a 3 element symmetry group there is another group beyond that
("superhypergroup"?) that takes that into account.

Now the first question to consider about the hypergroup is:  Is it really
larger than the original group or supergroup?  In other words:  When you have
solved the 4x4x4, does the center piece necessarily return to its original
position?  How about if you solve the cube in the hypergroup?

A problem with this problem, is that you cannot learn how to manipulate the
orientation of the center piece without taking your cube apart to look at the
thing.  (I DON'T recommend that.  My experience with Plummer's cube has taught
me that those center pieces are fragile.)  

Anybody have any insights into the problem?

While the center process is sufficient, the edge process will not

About broken 4^3 center cubies:

The center cubies take all the stress of holding in the edges and corners.
The post which breaks is 4mm square compared to the 16mm square cubie.
When I called Games People Play about my broken cube, another cube had
just been returned with the same problem.  So I traded my broken cubie
for an unbroken one and picked up a spare.

About Minow notation for 4^3:

     Name the faces L, R, F, B, U, D.  This follows the 3x3 notation.  The inner
     edges are then l, r, f, b, u, d.  The front, upper, right quadrant
     consists of one corner cube, FUR, two edge cubes, FUr and FRu, and one
     center cube, fur.  [decvax!minow at Berkeley]

Isn't there still a mistake here?  I think of "fur" as being a spot buried
in the cube.  If you mean the four cubies in the upper right quadrant of
the front face, then the name of the center cubie would be "Fur".
If you mean the front, upper, right octant then the two other center
cubies are "Urf" and Rfu".

About 4^3 processes:

** SPOILER WARNING ** SPOILER WARNING ** SPOILER WARNING **

My process to exchange three edge cubies is a U face commutator:

(RDf URf UFl) =    R'd'R  U'  R'dR  U

I think of my other 4^3 process as exchanging two half centers:

(Rfu Flu Rbd)          \
(Rub Fur Rdf)           =   R2 u' R2 u
(RBd FRd BRu RFu FLu)  /

You can get lost trying to read the permutations.  Just think of it
as injecting the two upper cubies from the front face into the right
face in exchange for the two upper cubies from the right face.
This is a move ISAACS requested.

My solution strategy:

** SPOILER WARNING ** SPOILER WARNING ** SPOILER WARNING **

1) Solve the top center using random methods.
2) Solve the corners using 3^3 moves.  (See \\Jeff Conquers the Cube//.)
3) Solve all centers with my center process.
4) Solve all edges with my edge process.
5) If a 2-edge monoflip or exchange is left over:
5a) In 2^3 mode, turn top and rotate three corners back; i.e.
    Uu   (Rr)2 (Bb)2 Rr Ff R'r' (Bb)2 Rr F'f' Rr.
5b) In 3^3 mode, undo 5a; i.e.
    U'   L2 B2 L' F' L B2 L F L.
5c) Repeat steps 3 and 4.

BACKGROUND
    On the 3^3, many people use variants of a 3-cycle of edges,
more-or-less as follows:

      let Rs = Right slice = R'L + roll cube so front is up

      T  (for tri-cycle?) = Rs U2 Rs' U2  = (UF,DF,UB)  
                                  to cycle 3 edges on a slice

Some people use it in the form
      R2 D' - T - D R2 = (UF,UR,UB) to get 3 on a face, without

flips, and some use

      Rs' U - T - U' Rs = Rs' U Rs U2 Rs' U Rs = (UF,LU,RU)

for 3 on a face, with flips, since it saves a move due to 

       U2 U' = U.
END BACKGROUND

   Now, this move, when transferred to the 4^3, seems to be the basis
of both Richard Pavelle's "S" move of 16-May, and Bernie Cosell's "M"
move of 17-May (Bernie using a left slice version of the third form).
   The move Roger Frye describes on 7-June is also the same as this
(re-oriented to a different face), and so is the "quite long" tool I
use.  To move only edges requires S3, and to move only centers
requires S5!!!  I still would like a "nice" (preferably short) center
pair move.

SPOILER          SPOILER             SPOILER

We have now several 3-cycles:

 (UBl,UFr,LDf)  =  U2 f' D f - U2 f' D' f      (from Minh Thai's book)

 (UFl,BUl,RUb)  =  l' - R U R' U' - l - U R U' R' (Minow, 6-June)

 (RDf,URf,UFl)  =  R' d R - U' - R' d R - U       (Frye, 7-June)

    Note that all of these have corresponding 3-cycles of centers, by
simply substituting a slice for its' corresponding edge in each of the
moves.  For instance, in Thai, substitute d for D; in Minow, r for R,
etc. There is also a version which cycles an edge an center together,
by rotating the appropriate face and slice together.
    In fact, it looks as though any simple move on the 4^3 will have a
left and right version, a forward and back version, and a slice and
edge version or two, along with combinations of these.  Is there any
way to put these into a canonical form so we can recognize related
moves?  What about canonical form on the 3^3?
    One more spoiler: to switch opposite centers (all 4 cubies):

  (F,B)  = (r2 U2 l2 U2)3.

END SPOILER          END SPOILER        END SPOILER

    Can the notation be usefully extended so as to talk about UB as
the pair of upper back edges, F as the front 4 center cubies, and Fu
as the upper two of F, etc.  It might make notating the permutations
easier.  Is there any notation to make various repeats easier;  for
instance, some expansion of "squared" to indicate  "primed"
(commutator) type repeat, or a repeat with all quarter twists in the
opposite direction.  Maybe (  )2 means repeat; (  )i2 means repeat
with sub-parts "primed", and (  )-2 repeats with qtws opposite.  The
purpose is to try to make it more obvious what each move is really
doing, and to be able to compare moves easier.
    Has anybody given any thought to notation the 5^3?
    By the way, if Bill Mann is listening, would you describe your
transform (mentioned by Edmond on 23-May)?

       (r2 u2)2  =  (Fur,Bur)

   but when repeated, I got

Subject: Magic Domino
To: cube-lovers at mc

The magic Domino (available, at least, at Games People Play here
in Cambridge) is a delightful little puzzle.  I would guess that it
is the easiest of the `Rubik-type' puzzles to date -- I think it is
even easier than the 2x2x2.  I solve it with two basic moves:
one fixes the corner (but screws up the edges), and then the other
fixes up the edges.

An interesting sidelight on the domino is the ability to interchange
ONE pair of edges.  The trick here (for reasons that I don't
understand yet) is that the supergroup rotation seems to invert the
parity of the edges.  That is: if you have the whole domino solved
and then re-solve the thing with both faces rotated by a quarter turn
around the center (5) cube.  You'll discover that you can't do this hardly
at all on just one face, since you wont be able to get the corners fixed.
But if you rotate both the white and black faces, then the corner parity
is OK, BUT.... the edge parity has been flipped and so you have done a
single interchange of two edges.

This message describes some edge processes for the 4x4 Rubic's Cube.

My collegue, Marty Hiller, came up with two simple processes
which she uses to order edges on the 4x4 cube.  They are sufficient
to solve all edge permutations:

(FUl UBl FDr DBr)		(r U2)^4 r

(FUl UFr UBl BUr FDr)		(r U2 r' U2)^3

The ^n notation means repeat the process n times.
Note that these processes probably modify the center cubes as well
but this is invisible if you have already solved the center.

			CHECKERBOARDS

I confirm Dave Plummer's result that it is impossible to make a
checkerboard on all faces of a cube of even side.  Proving this for
the 2^3 is sufficient, and implies the corollary I sent last year
that it is impossible to make S or Z or Zig-Zag patterns on all
sides of the 3^3.  This time I will outline my analysis of the
problem.

What we are asking for in each case is a pattern in which every
face has matching diagonally opposite corner facets and contrasting
adjacent corner facets.

First, consider any position in which diagonally opposite corner
facets match on each face.  If we connect every pair of corner
cubies that have diagonally opposite corner facets we get two
tetrahedrons of corner cubies.  A quick examination will show that
the four cubies in such a tetrahedron must either be

	1) Not all from the same cube,
	2) Four copies of the same cubie, or 
	3) Four different cubies from the same cube, in the correct
		position and orientation relative to each other.

Assuming case 3, we may place one tetrahedron in the home position
and consider how the other tetrahedron has been rigidly rotated
with respect to the first.  There are 12 rotations of the
tetrahedron.  One is the identity, three are 180-degree rotations
about the midpoints of two opposite edges, and six are 120-degree
rotations about a vertex.  

In the identity every face's adjacent corner facets fail to
contrast.  The 180-degree rotations have the corners like the 3^3
Zig-zag pattern, where two faces have noncontrasting corners.  The
120-degree rotations would make checkerboards, but violate the
corner twist invariant.

Approximate checkerboards can be made from the 180-degree rotation
and from the 120-degree rotation with one corner twisted.  In the
180-degree approximation, two faces have two wrong facets each.  In
the 120-degree approximation, three faces have one wrong facet
each.  Both are achievable with the 2^3 and 4^3, and I think these
are as close as you can get on any even-sided cube.

			SPOTS

Spot patterns of the 4^3 are those which have the pattern
		X X X X
		X Y Y X
		X Y Y X
		X X X X
on all nonblank faces.  There are a lot of them:  every permutation
of the centers is possible.  There are thus 6! = 720 spot patterns.
We may cut this number down by identifying positions that are
M-conjugates (recolorings) of each other.

As long as I am listing the permutations by conjugacy class, I may
as well break them down by recoloring type.  Last July I asked a
question about the possible rearrangements of colors on the cube.
I worked on the solution long enough to find that given a
``standard'' cube, there are five kinds of recoloring up to
M-conjugacy.
	Identity   -- The standard coloring.
	Reflection -- Identity in a mirror.
	Swap	   -- Identity with two adjacent colors exchanged.
	Wrench	   -- Identity with three adjacent colors cycled.
	Befuddler  -- Wrench in a mirror.
The Identity and Reflection are unique colorings.  There are twelve
Swaps and eight each of the Wrench and Befuddler recolorings.  Each
recoloring corresponds to 24 face permutations, achievable by
whole-cube moves.

Here, then, are the spot patterns.  Columns correspond to the
number of spots in the pattern.  The row groupings show the kind of
cube coloring the spot pattern comes from.  The patterns are given
as a permutation of faces:  (...XY...) and (Y...X) both mean that
face X has a spot colored Y, as shown at the beginning of this
message.  The number of permutations in each conjugacy class is
also given.

The answer: Fifteen six-spot patterns, six five-spots, eight
four-spots, two three-spots, two two-spots, and one no-spot.

			CROSSES

What cross patterns are possible on the 4^3?  We must first ask
what a cross pattern on the 4^3 should look like.  I consider the
following two kinds of cross.

		Thick Cross		Thin Cross

		  X O O X		 X O X X
		  O O O O		 O O O O
		  O O O O		 X O X X
		  X O O X		 X O X X

Every thick cross pattern is a rigid rotation or reflection of the
edge and face center pieces with respect to the corners.  This is
just like the 3^3 case except that the 3^3 has face centers that
are fixed relative to each other, and so does not allow reflec-
tions.  So in addition to the thick versions of Plummer's Cross and
Cristman's Cross, there are three new crosses.

    Thick Pons Cross                        Thick Fliptwist Cross
                       Thick Interlaced Cross
         U D D U                                   U L L U

                              U L L U

                     L F F L  F D D F  R B B R
         B F F B                                   B F F B
         F F F F              D R R D              F F F F
         F F F F              R R R R              F F F F

                              D R R D

For thin crosses, we first examine those in which the arms of the
crosses meet at the edges.  Again the figure facets are rigidly

When we relax the constraint that thin cross arms must meet at the
edges, the figure is no longer rigidly transformed with respect to
the ground.  Indeed, we might expect that adjacent crosses whose
arms do not meet might have colors that are opposite on the cube.
I carried out a long examination of the cases, and found that this
does not happen.  In fact, only one new color permutation arises.

The only other thin cross patterns in which not all crosses meet at

To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

I have read the patent of Larry Nichols who assigned it to Moleculon
and it looks to me like they have a very strong case against Ideal.
One should keep in mind, however, that more than 70% of patent
infringement cases go against the patentee.

The basic drawings and descriptions in the patent deal with the 2^3 
held together (non-rigidly) by magnets. Nichols discusses the possibility
of fixing the cubies rigidly in his description in a manner not unlike
Rubik. But the fact that he does not mention this aspect in his claims
may be his undoing. He mainly stresses the magnetic attachment. I would
not be surprised if the PTO told him that the rigid attachment would
comprise another implementation and he wished to avoid the extra 
expense (I am speaking from experience here). He discusses the puzzle 
aspects and some of the higher order cubes and non-cubes we have seen 
on the market.

In conclusion, I doubt he will get his 60M from Ideal but I think
he will get a non-trivial percentage and a continuing royalty.

  Take a cube(3x3x3) and re-color it in two colors, as follows:
Make 2 opposite faces with color 1 in the center, and color 2 on the
rest.  Call them "dots".  Take another pair of opposite faces and make
the 4 corners color 2 and the cross color 1.  Call them "pluses".
Finally take the last pair and make an "H" with color 1 and the 2
edges NOT adjacent to "dots" color 2.  Call them "H's".  In this cube,
every edge is the same, so is each corner, and the centers.  The result
is a cube where you only have to solve orientation problems, and never
need to position any cubie.  However, it's not quite the entire orientation
sub-cube - if you flip all 12 edges, you can't tell the difference.  Can
anybody come up with a coloring (2 or 3 colors - the centers could all be
colored with a different color from the edges and corners.  In fact, I guess
you could use 6 colors; the only necessity is for all edges to be the same,
and all corners the same. )... come up with a coloring which uses the
complete twisting sub-group.
   By the way, an elegant solution to the "edge-only" cube is to recolor
an Octahedron Cube so it is vertex centered.  Much nicer than peeling all
the corners of a regular cube.

The 4^3 doesn't have a supergroup in the sense of the 3^3 --
the orientations of the ceter cubies are determined by their positions.

However, there is one fairly natural adjunct group that people might 
try thinking about and solving.  A 4^3 shows 24 center cubies,
24 edge cubies, and eight corner cubies.  But if it were really
a solid cube chopped up by parallel slices, it would have eight
more cubies buried inside.  Call them stomach cubies.  The eight
stomach cubies form a 2^3 buried in the 4^3.  They move when you
twist slices.  Can people come up with tools to frob the
stomach cubies without disturbing the visible cubies?  What is
the order of the adjunct group?

shorthand, so one could build macros (or simply define better notation).
The notation is good for the general case, but hard for the 3^3 case and
down - it is a general X-Y-Z notation, R or L direction, 1-n layer.
Thus RX1 is our "R"; "ZL1" = U', etc. The colors are pretty.  You can
save a cube on disk if you haven't finished solving it, but only one.
   Why doesn't someone design and write a general group-theory puzzle

associate it with a matrix, name some permutations in the matrix for
moves, and you should have any conceivable (drawable) rotating axis

When you have seen Rubik's Revenge, have you seen everything?
Maybe not.


                    Supergroups

There is some confusion about the meaning of the term Supergroup
for the larger cubes.  There are two issues at stake:

        (1) In the 4^3 and larger cubes, there are pieces that may
            be permuted but are colored the same.  Are positions
            that differ only in the permutation of identically-
            colored facets to be considered distinct?

        (2) In all odd-sized cubes, each face has a center facet
            that may be twisted.  Are positions that differ only in
            the twist of face centers to be considered distinct?

If the answer to (1) is `no', the puzzle is not a group, but a
collection of cosets.  I find this interesting only in that it is
understood by the masses, and then the answer to (2) is `no'.

If the answer to both (1) and (2) is `yes', we have what I would
call the Supergroup.  I mark my cubes so that I can distinguish
patterns in this group.  I discussed a way of doing this for the
3^3 in my message of 9 January 81 0551-EST.  For Rubik's Revenge, I
use a similar procedure, except now two spots must be cut out on
each face:
        +-----------------------+
        |     |     |     |     |
        |     |    *|*    |     |
        |-----+-----+-----+-----|
        |     |    *|*    |     |
        |     |     |    *|*    |
        |-----+-----+-----+-----|
        |     |     |    *|*    |
        |     |     |     |     |
        |-----+-----+-----+-----|
        |     |     |     |     |
        |     |     |     |     |
        +-----------------------+
Also, I now arrange the faces T-symmetrically, with the spots
toward the girdle.

Jim Saxe first brought it to my attention that we may answer `yes'
to (1) and `no' to (2).  We get a group that ignores face center
orientation.  This is probably what people mean when they say there
is no Supergroup for Rubik's Revenge:  This is the group of the
puzzle, and the Supergroup (as I have defined it) is the same for
the 4^3.  But in the 5^3 this group is distinct both from the
Supergroup and from the Color Cosets.


                    The 57th Piece

Alan Bawden, in his message of 5 June 82, despaired of explaining
the mechanical workings of Rubik's Revenge.  I will now rush in.

If you take your Rubik's Revenge apart (as described in Ronald B.
Harvey's message of 19 May 82, not recommended by Alan Bawden), you
will find that the cubies ride around on a sphere:  the mysterious
57th piece.  Only the face centers are connected to the sphere;
they have flanges that hold the edges in place, and the centers and
edges have flanges that hold the corners in place.  The tricky part
is the linkage between the sphere and the face center cubies.

The four center cubies of a face have extensions that together form
a mushroom-shaped plug.  Each plug extends from the center of the
face inward and is cut in quarters lengthwise.  There are six
sockets on the sphere in which these plugs will fit and may rotate,
but may not be pulled out.  This is sufficient to implement a
puzzle isomorphic to the 3^3, namely the 4^3 where we allow only
face twists.

The other necessity for a 4^3 is to be able to twist the six center
slices, which we name after their adjacent faces.  To accomplish
this, there are grooves in the sphere that form three orthogonal
great circles.  Each groove has the cross section of half of a
socket, and includes the four half-sockets that correspond to a
center slice.  When we twist one of those center slices, the
half-plugs formed by pairs of face centers in that slice ride
around the sphere in the grooves.  Of course there is an adjacent
center slice; when it is moved, it takes the sphere with it.  The
reason the grooves cannot have the cross-section of a socket is
that then, when we twisted half the cube with respect to the other,
the sphere might turn forty-five degrees, preventing center slice
twists along the other great circles.

When you twist the U center-slice of your cube, does the sphere
move or stay fixed?  To find out without taking the cube apart,
hold the cube by the D center slice and repeatedly twist the U
center slice clockwise. Don't touch the U or D faces while doing
this.  Mostly, the U face will turn and the D face will stay fixed,
because the cubie-cubie friction is greater than the cubie-sphere
friction.  Eventually, however, you will either see the U face lag
behind the U center slice, or the D face move to follow the U
center slice.  If the U face lags, the sphere is not moving; if the
D face moves, the sphere is moving.

I will take this opportunity to mention another feature of the
interior sphere:  It has screws in it.  I took my screws out, but
the sphere didn't come apart.  Then I put them back in, on the
`don't screw with it' principle.  Perhaps they are there so Rubik's
Revenge won't float?  This issue was raised by Tom Davis (12 August
80) back when people were interested in solving the 3^3 underwater.
The last I heard, Richard Pavelle (25 July 1980) was able to solve
the cube with only five gulps of air.  I imagine some of the
30-second whiz kids can solve Rubik's Cube while completely
submerged.  But Rubik's Revenge?  Don't hold your breath.


                    The Mechanical Invisible Group

Alan Bawden's message posed an interesting question about the 57th
piece, which I will state somewhat differently.  Suppose we paint
the sockets of the sphere according to the colors of the face
centers that inhabit them.  Then we mix up Rubik's Revenge and
solve it.  Must the sockets still match their face centers?

The answer is no.  In fact, the sphere may be in any of the
twenty-four positions consistent with it having once matched the
face centers.  To show this, we will show how to perform a
ninety-degree whole-cube move of the outside without moving the
sphere.  This is equivalent to turning the sphere ninety degrees,
and we can repeat the procedure and its conjugates to move the
sphere to any of its twenty-four positions.

In order to twist Rubik's Revenge without moving the sphere, we
place the cube in a position such that the U, F, and R center
slices do not move the sphere and restrict ourselves to the moves:

U1                      Clockwise quarter twist of the U face
U2                      Clockwise quarter twist of the U half
                                (face and center slice together)
D1                      Clockwise quarter twist of the D face
U1',U2',D1'             Counterclockwise quarter twists
R1,R2,L1,R1',R2',L1'    Likewise for R
F1,F2,B1,F1',F2',B1'    Likewise for F

The move is actually fairly simple.  The tricky part is moving the
L center slice cubies without moving the sphere.  To do this,
remember the eight-flip

        X = (R1 L1 U1 D1 F1 B1)^2

from the 3^3.  This exchanges the L and R center slices in the 4^3,
allowing us to cycle the L center slice cubies in the R center
slice.

        R2 L1' X R2 R1' X

is a sphere-fixing whole-cube move taking 24 qtw after cancellation.


                    The Theoretical Invisible Group

So much for tawdry reality.  As Allan C. Wechsler pointed out on 6
August 82, we can imagine a 4^3 puzzle that contains a 2^3 on the
inside.  If we solve the outside, must the inside be solved?  The
process shown above for the 57th piece implies not, for that
process performs the RL antislice on the 2^3 with respect to the
outside.  Can any move of the 2^3 be accomplished?  Elementary
group theory says no, for odd permutations of the Rubik's Revenge
edge cubies are also odd permutations of the 2^3's cubies.

I ran the Furst, Hopcroft, and Luks algorithm on the problem.  It
turns out that the permutation parity is the only restriction on
what can be done with the 2^3.  Thus if we solve the outside, the
inside may be in any one of the (8! 3^7)/2 positions obtainable in
an even number of quarter twists on a 2^3 puzzle.  This in
particular includes all whole-cube moves of the 2^3.
Unfortunately, I don't know any simple processes for whole-cube
moves or for turning two adjacent faces.

Subject: Tsukuda's Square
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

  Just got a new group-theory puzzle, called Tsukuda's Square.  It's
sort of like the 15/16 puzzle, but harder.  It consists of a 4x4 matrix
in the center with the numbers from 1 to 16.  On the left side are
4 plungers, one for each row.  At the top is one plunger, which pushes
down columns 2, 3, and 4, all at once.  Both the top and the side plungers
push the rows or columns over 1 square; releasing them causes the same row(s)
or columns to slide back.  When the top plunger is pushed down, the number
1 row plunger cannot be pushed because of interference; that is the only
interference.
   A typical move, for instance, would be to push in the #2 row plunger,
push the top, release the #2, release the top.  This would change
           1 2 3 4
           5 6 7 8  (only looking at the top 2 rows)
  to
    
           1 3 4 8
           2 5 6 7.
  You can push 2 or 3 (or even4) side plungers at once.  Pushing an
adjacent pair is even useful in solving this thing.
   At any rate, it has the normal even parity problem - that is, you 
cannot exchange a single pair, but you can exchange 2 pairs, or permute
three squares.  Because of the limited moves, it is not nearly so simple
as it looks.  I can permute 3 in one specific position, and it takes me
12 moves to do so (where a move is a push of 1 or more side plungers,
then push the top, then release them, or the reverse [push the top first]).
Can anyone develop some more efficient algorithms?

I finally found a 4x4x4 cube a couple of days ago, and have a couple of
interesting observations.  Forgive me if I repeat anything said so far,
but I have been ignoring everything on this list having to do with the
4^3 cube for fear of any sort of spoilers.

Using my 3^3 knowledge, I found it fairly easy to get it almost solved.
Half the time, however, I got it to the state where everything was
solved except that two adjacent edge cubies were flipped.  I finally
convinced myself by means of a somewhat involved (and probably
fallacious) "proof" that I would have to exchange them before I could
solve the cube.

My first observation is simply a trivial proof of that fact that I
discovered immediately after I took the cube apart for the first time
to see what was inside -- it is mechanically impossible to put the cube
back together with the cubies flipped (but not exchanged).  Some
similar parity-type arguments can be made about possible configurations
of the center cubies.  What is interesting is that this presents a new
method of proving things about configurations -- if one can dream up a
mechanical model of a cube with different guts, it may be obvious that
some sorts of things are impossible.  The cube simply has to behave the
same way externally.  I wonder if there are nice ways to look at the
various parity-trinity features of the three-cube by looking at it
using a different model of the internal mechanics.

My second observation is that although a 5^3 and a 6^3 may someday
appear on the market, the 7^3 will be pretty tricky to build.  When one
of the faces of a 7^3 is turned 45 degrees, the corner will lie
completely outside the original cube.  Any mechanical linkage will be
complicated indeed.  Maybe a cube could be built with little
microprocessors inside each cubie controlling little arms and hooks to
grab adjacent cubie faces ...

  The "Games and Mathematics" article in "Rubik's" Magazine (mentioned
yesterday) asks an interestion question: how can you characterize the
random coloring on a cube in order to determine if the cube is 1) solvable
by twisting, or 2) solvable by  dismantling and reassembling.  
  The obvious criteria are 6 colors, 9 of each, 4 on edges, 4 on corners, 1
on a center, no 2 facies of a cubie the same color.  For case 2, Keri
claims you need 4 more tests.  For instance, he gives test 1: Given 1
corner with colors A, B, and C, let the other 3 colors be a, b, and c.
Then you can't have a capital and small of the same letter on one corner,
and the 8 corners are exactly the 8 combinations.  What are the other
tests?  Are 4 really necessary?  What are the tests for case 1?
   By the way, he (from some other article) classifies the 3 unscrambling
methods as follows:
   1) Chemical unscrambling: repaint the sides.
   2) Physical unscrambling: dismantle and reassemble
   3) Mechanical (or mathematical): normal way, by twisting.

Subject:  Rubik's Revenge problem--deep & shallow hypermoves
Message-Id: <20Aug82 024233 JS30@CMU-10A>

Consider all manipulations of Rubik's revenge as consisting of two
sorts of moves, namely (1) shallow moves, which turn an outer layer
with respect to the remaining three layers, and (2) deep moves, which
turn an outer layer and the adjacent inner layer with respect to the
remaining two layers.  [For the purposes of this problem, we will
regard a manipulation that turns only an inner layer--resulting, for
example, in faces that look like
				XXXX
				OOOO
				XXXX
				XXXX
when applied to a solved cube--as consisting of two moves, one deep and
one shallow, in opposing directions.]  If only shallow moves are
permitted, the 4x4x4 simulates a 3x3x3.  If only deep moves are
permitted, the 4x4x4 simulates a 2x2x2.  Define a shallow (deep)
hypermove as an arbitrary sequence of shallow (resp. deep) moves.
My question is:

	What is the maximum number of hypermoves required
	to solve the 4x4x4?

Notice that the answer to this question may depend on whether or not
one considers identically-colored face centers to be distinct (as
Hoey points out, the puzzle is not a group if identically-colored
face centers are not distinguished) and on whether or not one worries
about the positions of the eight hypothetical stomach cubies.  Also,
if the minimal number of hypermoves is odd, then it might be
important to start with one class of move.  That is, it is plausible
that sequences of the form SDSDS may be sufficient while sequences of
the form DSDSD may not.

CC: James Saxe at CMU-10A
Message-Id: <23Aug82 162336 DH51@CMU-10A>

There is an easy lower bound on the number of hypermoves needed to
solve Rubik's Revenge.  If we distinguish like-colored face
centers, let us fix the BL center of the D face, permitting only
the shallow moves B1, F1, U1, U3, L1, R1, and their inverses, and
the deep moves F2, U2, R2, and their inverses.  Let us compute the
number of hypermoves needed to solve just the face centers of
Rubik's Revenge.  A shallow hypermove can achieve SF = 4^6 = 4096
different face center positions.  A deep hypermove can achieve
DF = 7! 3^6 = 3674160 different face center positions.  So in four
hypermoves, at most
	1 + (SF + DF) + 2 SF DF + (SF + DF) SF DF + 2 SF DF SF DF
	       = 453,021,789,719,303,692,337
face center positions can be achieved.  Since this is fewer than
the
	23! = 25,852,016,738,884,976,640,000
face center positions of Rubik's Revenge, some face-center
positions will require at least five hypermoves.

If like-colored face centers are not distinguished, the best lower
bound I can find using this method is three hypermoves.  If stomach
cubies are considered, I think both bounds increase by one, since
only deep moves can touch them.

It seems strange that this method relies only on the face center
solution.  Similar arguments about edges are not as good, because
so many edge positions are achievable using shallow hypermoves.
Corners are practically irrelevant, since they can be fixed using
only shallow hypermoves.

With respect to the question of odd sequences of hypermoves, Jim
Saxe mentions that ``it is plausible that sequences of the form
SDSDS may be sufficient while sequences of the form DSDSD may
not.''  I would like to add the further plausibility that both
types may be sufficient, while neither may suffice alone.

There are SF different shallow hypermoves and DF different deep
hypermoves, and two similar hypermoves in succession can be
collapsed into one.  The formula expresses the number of
alternating sequences of length at most four, which is the sum of
the ``Number'' column below.

        Length   Type    Number
        0                1

	4        DSDS    SF^2 * DF^2

    I can see more-or-less what you're doing, but I haven't been
    able to parse the formula.

Well, I did leave out the multiplication signs.

    Also, I haven't seen your notation before.  I take it that "U3"
    is equivalent to "D1'", except hold the D1 in place.

Right.  I used this notation in "Lower Bounds for the 4x4x4" on 2
June and "Invisible Revenge" on 9 August.

    How do you represent half twists?  Only by two quarters, or is
    there a shorthand?

There is U3^2, not much of a shorthand.  For the U slice move, I
hinted at U21'.

    From a group theory perspective, is it easier to talk about
    hypermoves than slice moves?

Hypermoves are a curiosity that Jim Saxe dreamed up.  Any sequence
of depth 1 (or 3) moves is a single hypermove, as is any sequence
of depth 2 moves.  I assume you mean to ask whether it's easier to
talk the way I usually talk, in terms of what I will call "twist
moves" to distinguish them from "slice moves".

The question boils down to what set of generators (moves) you want
to use when counting the length of a process.  This topic was
endlessly rehashed in 1980 when people were trying to decide
whether to call a half-twist a single move or two.  Jim Saxe nearly
sent a message in 1980 about using only two generators to solve
Rubik's cube.  [As I recall, computer failure trashed the message
and he never retyped it.]  Certainly we can all do slices and
half-twists.  The question is how many moves to charge for such an
operation.  The richer the set of generators, the fewer the number
of moves, but the more complex the explanation of the generators.

I use the "quarter-twist" convention for the 3^3.  The generators
are 90-degree rotations of faces.  This seems natural, because it
is the minimal set that satisfies the following criteria.

    1.  Every possible cube position can be created using these
            generators, up to whole-cube moves.  This is a basic
            criterion.
    2.  The inverse of every generator is a generator.  This is
            necessary so that we have a metric.
    3.  Any position that can be reached by performing part of a
            generator is a generator.  This criterion ties the
            mechanical operations used in the cube to the
            permutation group.  Otherwise we could have generators
            like FUF and F'U' and perform F with their composition.
            Charging two moves for F in that circumstance is
            somewhat bizarre.  
    4.  Every M-conjugate of a generator is a generator.  This is
            an aesthetic consideration.  We could leave out the D
            and D' twists and still solve the 3^3, but that breaks
            up the symmetry of the puzzle.

Why do I want the generator set to be minimal?  Well, we could make
it maximal, but then we would have ``over 3 billion'' generators.
What I am looking for is a canonical set, and minimality seems like
the best way of choosing among metrics.  Thus we exclude slice
moves as generators because they are not necessary.

For the 3^3, this set is particularly fortunate, because the
converse of criterion 4 holds:  Every two generators are
M-conjugate.  This allows us to identify some local maxima without
long computations (14 December 1980) and to tighten lower bounds
using parity principles (9 January 1981).

    Will that also be true on the 5^3, 6^3, etc?

I would just as soon stick with a compatible metric.  This is not
to say that there cannot be abbreviations for these moves, simply
that for the sake of asking ``how many moves does this take'' we
count the number of quarter-twists.

We unfortunately don't have the converse of criterion 4 for cubes
larger than 3^3.  For the 4^3, for instance, there are two flavors
of move:  deep and shallow.  Dave Plummer (26 September 1981)
described certain positions of the 4^3 as local maxima, but I have
convinced him that we cannot demonstrate the truth of that
assertion using known techniques other than exhaustive search.  My
note of 2 June was able to use only one kind of parity in the lower
bound argument.  Both problems are due to the lack of the converse.

    From a solving perspective, it seems clumsy.

I'll agree that the generators are few in this scheme, but it is
possible to generate macros.  For instance, consider describing a
slice move on the 3^3 cube.  Singmaster uses the notation Fs to
denote the F1B1' = F12'3 slice move.  We can now also talk about
the F12' slice move, which is how everyone actually does the move.
I think this is much easier to remember than Allan Wechsler's IJK
notation (introduced 18 July 1980) or Doug Landauer's HPS notation
(27 August 1980) for dealing with whole-cube moves.

I'm still not too happy about the state of RubikSong, but I think
it's a matter of human engineering, and I like to stick with the
mathematics.

each face has 5 corners, 5 edges, and one fixed center (which only rotates,
but does not move relative to the others), exactly as in the cube.  Scot
Morris claims the Cube has 10^19 combinations, the Revenge has 10^48, and
that the Megaminx has 10^69.  Is this correct?  Meffert claims the Megaminx

that cube moves should move over easier, and do closer to the same things

Message-Id: <23Sep82 120644 DH51@CMU-10A>

Funny you should ask about the positions of the MegaMinx.  I
analyzed this puzzle with the FHL algorithm.  It was the longest
run of that algorithm that I have heard of, something like 20 CPU
hours.  Necessity was the mother of checkpointing.

The standard MegaMinx has 20 corners and 30 edges.  Both the edge
and corner permutation parities must be even.  Corner and edge
orientation parities are zero (mod 3) and (mod 2), respectively.
These are the only invariants, so there are twenty-four orbits and
	(20! 3^20 30! 2^30)/24 ~ 1.007E68
positions.  In the SuperMegaMinx, a 1/5 twist of a single face
center is possible, so there are
	(20! 3^20 30! 2^30 5^12)/24 ~ 2.458E76
positions.  I think the MegaMinx is going to be easier than Rubik's
Revenge, not because there is more carryover from the cube, but
because there is more of the puzzle that is not affected by a
single generator.  Computing a lower bound that takes account of
generators that commute is going to be difficult, however: there
are triples of commuting generators, and we can find commuting
triples {A, B, C} and {A, B, D} such that C and D do not commute.

A curious question:  What do we mean by the corner orientation of
the MegaMinx when the corner permutation is not the identity?  On
the cube, we took the corner colortabs on two opposite faces of a
solved cube and marked both the tab and its position.  Then in a
scrambled cube we counted the position of each marked corner
colortab relative to the marked position on its cubie.  This
procedure doesn't work on the dodecahedron:  where should we mark
the tabs on those corner cubies that are not on the two opposite
faces?

It was a year before I realized that the choice of placing the
marks on opposite faces of the cube was arbitrary.  The marked tabs
and positions can be chosen any way that gives us one marked tab
and one marked position per cubie, and has zero orientation parity
in a solved cube.  It is customary to enforce the second criterion
by requiring that marked positions be the positions of marked tabs
in a solved cube.  The same argument holds for edges, and both
generalize to the MegaMinx.

Why is there orientation parity?  When we twist an n-gon face, the
edge cubies move in an n-cycle and their colortabs move in two
n-cycles.  We call this an ``untwisted cycle''.  But we could
conceive (see below) of a puzzle where the edge colortabs would
move in a single 2n-cycle.  This would be a ``twisted cycle'', and
would violate orientation parity.  Similar arguments hold for
corner cubies, whose kn tabs must move in k n-cycles rather than
k/d nd-cycles, for d a divisor of k (note that k=4 for the
icosahedron (but the icoshahedron has two corner tab orbits, so
quite a different argument applies)).  To summarize, any puzzle
that moves pieces in untwisted cycles must preserve orientation
parity.

I wonder if some argument of this type can be made for the
tesseract.  The argument depends on the orientation group being
Abelian (it has in fact been cyclic in our examples), and at least
some of the hypercubies have nonabelian orientation groups.
Perhaps we have to use Abelian quotients of the orientation groups.
Has anyone seen the paper on the tesseract that was mentioned by
Hofstatder?

Retreating to three dimensions, let's consider a variant on Rubik's
cube.  Suppose you had a gear (heh) embedded in the URF and BLD
corners, such that whenever an edge cubie passed by one of these
corners (e.g. from UR to UF by twisting U) it would flip (go from
UR to FU).  This would violate EOP on every quarter-twist!  Of
course, you know what positions would be possible in such a puzzle.
So now let's consider gears in the FU, BL, and RD edges that twist
corner cubies as they go by.  I don't know about this puzzle, but I
suspect that there are only four orbits.

each side face with 9 squares, and the top and bottom the appropriate n-gon

Subject: The 2x2x2x2 magic tesseract
To: Cube-Lovers at MIT-MC

Allan Wechsler's message of 17 May 1982 contains some interesting
comments on the four-dimensional hyper-cube, or tesseract.  I will
expand on them, and offer a correction.

The tesseract has eight cubical sides, labeled Back, Front, Up,
Down, Left, Right, Out, and In.  Each side may be twisted in any of
the twenty-four ways that a cube may be rotated in three-space.
Since these twenty-four twists are generated by repeated
application of the six quarter-twists of the cube, I consider a
move to be a single quarter-twist of one of the cubical sides.

I have picked three of the quarter-twists of the Out side to be the
``clockwise'' twists, given as Of, Ou, and Or below.  Given the
constraint that clockwise twists must be conjugates of each other
with respect to the movement group of the tesseract in four-space,
the remaining clockwise quarter-twists are determined.  In the
following list, the upper-case letter denotes the side to be
twisted, and the quarter-twist is displayed as a permutation on the
(square) faces of that (cubical) side.

Of=(URDL)  Ou=(RFLB)  Or=(FUBD)     If=(RULD)  Iu=(FRBL)  Ir=(UFDB)
Ro=(UFDB)  Rf=(OUID)  Ru=(FOBI)     Lo=(FUBD)  Lf=(UODI)  Lu=(OFIB)
Ur=(OFIB)  Uo=(FRBL)  Uf=(ROLI)     Dr=(FOBI)  Do=(RFLB)  Df=(ORIL)
Fu=(ORIL)  Fr=(UODI)  Fo=(RULD)     Bu=(ROLI)  Br=(OUID)  Bo=(URDL)

These twists have the satisfying property that when two different
twists move an edge from position E1 to position E2, then one of
the twists is clockwise and the other counterclockwise.  For
instance, both the Dr and the Fr' twists move an edge from FID to
FOD.  Another property that mimics the three dimensional cube is
that clockwise twists on opposite sides are reversed:  The action
of Of on the O side is the inverse of the action of If on the I
side.

To see how the table above is constructed we must describe the
movement group of the tesseract (the group of whole-tesseract moves
in four-space).  I look at it as operating on quadruples VWXY of
mutually adjacent sides.  To see if VWXY->V'W'X'Y' is in the group,
replace all occurrences of B, D, L, and I with F, U, R, and O,
respectively.  The resulting permutation must have the same parity
as the number of replacements performed.  Thus FLOD->UROB is in the
group, because we perform three replacements to form FROU->UROF, an
odd permutation.

To tell whether a quarter-twist is clockwise or not, take the side
V to be twisted, two consecutive letters WX from the permutation,
and a fourth, orthogonal letter Y from {F, U, R, O}.  If VWXY->OURF
is in the movement group of the tesseract, then we have the
clockwise quarter-twist Vy, otherwise the counterclockwise
quarter-twist Vy'.  For instance, if we twist the U side as (LFRB),
then VWXY=ULFO->OURF is in the movement group (one replacement
creates the four-cycle URFO->OURF), so we have the clockwise twist
Uo.

Let us now examine the reachable configurations of the corners of
the tesseract.  Every quarter-twist moves eight corners in two
four-cycles, so only even permutations of the corners are
achievable.  The orientations of the corners are more complex.  If
we move corner VWXY to V'W'X'Y', then VWXY->V'W'X'Y' must be in the
movement group of the tesseract.  Thus only half of the twenty-four
permutations of {V', W', X', Y'} are achievable, because of the
permutation parity constraint.

To define the orientation of the corners, we label the sides of
each corner and each corner position with the letters VWXY, and
read the orientation of a cubie as the letters it has in the V, W,
X, and Y sides of its position.  It is important here to obey the
the permutation parity constraint when doing the labelling, so that
each cubie may be placed in the home (VWXY) orientation in any
position.  For instance, one possible labelling is as follows,
where each column refers to a corner:

V   F  F  F  F  F  F  F  F  B  B  B  B  B  B  B  B
W   U  U  U  U  D  D  D  D  U  U  U  U  D  D  D  D
X   R  O  L  I  O  L  I  R  O  L  I  R  R  O  L  I
Y   O  L  I  R  R  O  L  I  R  O  L  I  O  L  I  R

Thus if the FURO corner (column 1) is in the FLUO position (column
2), then its orientation is VXYW.  Any orientation that is an even
permutation of VWXY is possible.  The group of orientations, A4, is
the same as the movement group of the tetrahedron (with vertices
labeled VWXY) in three-space.

As I suggested in my message of 23 September 1982, this orientation
group is not Abelian, so the orientation of the last corner is not
completely determined by the orientations of the other fifteen.  To
see what is determined, let us look at the tetrahedron with
vertices at half of the corners of a three-dimensional cube, say
the FUR, FDL, BUL, and BDR corners.  As I reported on 15 June 1982,
the twelve movements of the tetrahedron consist of the identity,
three 180-degree rotations, and eight 120-degree rotations.  The
June message also mentions that if those corner cubies are moved as
a unit, preserving their positions and orientations relative to
each other, then the 180-degree rotations are achievable on the 3^3
(they are the corners of the Zig-Zag pattern) but the 120-degree
rotations violate the corner twist invariant.  Of course, four of
them perform a net clockwise twist, and four of them perform a net
counterclockwise twist.  Define the twist of a tetrahedron movement
to be the net clockwise twist it applies to the corners of the
cube.  Thus the twist of the movements of a tetrahedron VWXY is
given by the following table.

        Twist 0: VWXY, WVYX, XYVW, YXWV
        Twist 1: VXYW, WYXV, XVWY, YWVX
        Twist 2: VYWX, WXVY, XWYV, YVXW

By reasoning about the actions on corners of the cube, it is clear
that the twist of the product of two movements is the sum of their
twist, modulo three.  Thus the twist group is an Abelian quotient
of A4, isomorphic to the cyclic group on three elements.

Since the orientation group of the tesseract corners is also A4, we
may use the twist group to construct an orientation invariant of
the corners of the tesseract.  As described in the September
message, each qtw moves the corners in untwisted cycles, so the sum
of the twists of the orientations of the corners must be zero,
modulo 3.

I ran the Furst, Hopcroft, and Luks algorithm on the 2^4 tesseract
and found that this is the only invariant of corner orientation.
Therefore, the number of reachable positions of the tesseract is
(15! / 2) (12^15 / 3) ~ 3.358 x 10^18.  This is larger than Allan
Wechsler's upper bound because he thought there were only six
orientations of each corner.

Subject: megaminx; octahedron
To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC

  The Megaminx is now on sale in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It is,
as pictured, a dodecahedron with each face twistable in fifths, and
containing 5 corners, 5 edges, and a center.  Instead of 12 different
colors it seems to have 10, with the red and yellow duplicated; that 
means you can have a parity problem at the end if you exchange the
duplicate edges.  Solving seems to be pretty straightforward, except
new edge moves must be developed - the "slice" moves aren't very
effective.
  I also found an octahedron much more analogous to the cube then the
one with the 9 triangular faces (and independent vertices).  ON this
one there is a triangular center, 3 diamond shaped corners, and longish
edges on each face.  The centers are equivalent to the corners of a cube,
but monochromatic; the corners of the octahedron are equivalent to the
centers of a cube, but have 4 colors.  You can solve it with supergroup
cube moves, but it can be solved more efficiently, I think, by doing
the corners first (matching up the colors), then the edges, then the centers.
Needed are moves that move edges without twisting corners (do we
have any good corner moves that don't rotate centers on a cube?)
  One final puzzle that has come out - it's called Inversion, and it's
a sliding block cube.  There are 19 identical cubies, each colored half
red and half blue (3 faces each) and arranged around the edges of a cube
with one extra empty space.  They are held in place by a Rubiks-like
mechanism through the centers of the big cube.  Thus each edge of the big
cube has 3 of the little cubes, or 2 of them plus a space.  The little
cubes are each in one of the 8 possible orientations; One orientation
is represented by one cubie, 3 orientations by 2 cubies each, and 4
orientations by 3 cubies each.  The idea is to slide the cubies around
the edges of the big cube so that the outside is all red or all blue,
or some other regular pattern;  Inverting from (say) red to blue means
sliding all cubies to more-or-less the diagonal opposite positions.

In-Reply-To: Your message of 29-Oct-82 0922-PDT

  Yes, I solved it.  It didn't take much work at all - mainly deciding
which cube moves transfered well.  The only really diferent moves involved
switching edges on the last face, or flipping them.  Both had fairly easy
solutions.  I do one face first, and then work upwards from there.  There
is a 7 move sequence on the cube, which moves an edge from the upper face
to a middle edge, which transfers nicely to the Megaminx.  Corners just
work, without any special algorithms.  The 4 move commutator F R' F' R
moves to the Megaminx and will move corners around.  Of course, none of
the slice moves work, so new edge moves are needed.  We also need an
easy way to move centers, and to move stars around, to make pretty patterns.
  By the way, the one two I got, and several a friend got in L.A., all had
10 colors, with red and yellow duplicated.  However, last Friday I saw
ones with 12 colors (I think - they were in boxes), with dark green and
brown as the new colors.  I don't know if the 10 colors are a mistake or
intentional.  The presence of a duplicate edge piece makes the solution
slightly more difficult.

Hexominoes are easier to find than pentominoes.  If you treat four of
the basic trianglular pieces of the Snake puzzle as a unit square, a
24-piece Snake can be configured to make any hexomino.  Just buy
enough snakes.  If you want to break the rivets on the snake, you can
make pentominoes by removing four pieces.  In fact, I wish there were
a modular Snake consisting of snap-together pieces so that different
length Snakes could be realized more simply.

Re:   "Pentominoes"...

   GABRIEL toy company markets a nice set of pentominoes under the name
"HEXED".  They are the makers of the puzzles "Hi-Q" and "PYTHAGORAS".  The 
latter is a nice set of "tangrams" if you  are interested in them.  You should
be able to get any of these in any well stocked toy store ( like Toys 'R Us ).
If you are interested in getting solutions for them, me ( Yekta Gursel ) and
a friend of mine ( Douglas Macdonald ) wrote a program on a microcomputer to 
solve any pentomino problem.  The description of the program appeared in
November 1979 issue of BYTE.  It is written for a COMMODORE PET, but can be
adopted toi any microcomputer relatively easily.  If you do not have access to
a microcomputer we can print the solutions out for you just for the cost of
paper and postage ( a few dollars ).  If you are interested please let me

Sorry, I accidentally sent the pentominoes message to you instead of the

   What I wanted to add is that one can also get a set of hexaminoes, though
this is a little bit harder.  They are marketed in England under the name 
"Spear's Multipuzzle".  The set comes with a few extra pieces, but nevertheless
contains a full set of hexaminoes.  The quality is not as good as Gabriel's
"HEXED".

A friend of mine has a set of pentominoes called ``Quintillions'',
available from

	1227 Lorene, Suite 16
	Pasadena MD  21122

Basic Quintillions is a set containing the twelve planar

nonplanar pentominoes for $39.00.  (The literature says there are
eighteen pieces, but I think there are only seventeen nonplanar
pentominoes.  Perhaps they include some extra piece so you can make
a 3x5x6 rectangular prism)  The basic set is a high-quality puzzle,
each piece laser-cut from a single piece of wood, with a velour
box.

If you want to make your own, you can glue little cubes together.
Here are patterns for the planar pentominoes:

For the nonplanar pieces, let U, D, and B stand for cubes on the
upper level, lower level, and both levels.  The pieces I know of
are as follows, where an asterisk denotes a piece that can be
