A similar article in the LA Times went on to say that the fellow at
Moleculon had patented a 2x2 cube held together with magnets, but
mention was made in the patent of larger cubes and mechanical linkages.
How specific the mentions were is not clear.  He was also quoted to the
effect that they do not dispute that Rubik invented the present cube,
but it infringes on their patent.  Moleculon apparently offered to sell
rights to their toy to Ideal before Rubik and were turned down.
