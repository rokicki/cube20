    3.  (forward to cube-lovers if necessary)  I hear there is a textbook
    on group theory using Rubik's Cube for all its examples (or some such
    gimmick).  Have you heard anything about it?
    ...

Not I.  Anyone else?  I'd be interested in seeing this myself.



There was a book published a few years ago which had one chapter
dealing with the cube.

Groups and Geometry - Peter Neumann, Gabrielle A. Stoy, & E. C. Thompson
  The Mathematical Institute - Oxford University
  The last chapter is "The Group Theory of the Hungarian Magic Cube".
