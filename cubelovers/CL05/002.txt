In September I received a query from Phil Servito, who
has since joined this mailing list, about a game or puzzle
called "Hinton's cubes".  Does anybody have any information
about this toy besides the following?

Charles Howard Hinton was an American mathematician who
believed that anybody could learn to do four-dimensional
visualization if properly trained.  He invented a set of
colored blocks which were supposed do this training.

Philip -- you said Martin Gardner knows more.  Is this because
the cubes were once discussed in a Sci. Am. Mathematical
Games column?  If so, the Sci. Am. cumulative index may help.
