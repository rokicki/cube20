You might like to post the following message to the Cube-lovers list:

One of the best sources for various "twisting puzzles" (and purportedly
the only remaining supplier of the 5x5x5 cubes, which he is
selling for $ 15 plus postage) is

  Dr. Christoph Bandelow 
  Haarholzer Strasse 13
  4630 Bochum-Stiepel
  West Germany
  phone: 0234-797794

I have just obtained two 5x5x5 cubes from him.
