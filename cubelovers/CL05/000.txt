Subject:  The Archive & Administrivia
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-MC

Those of you who look through the archives of old Cube-Lovers mail
will notice that I have split off a new section of the archive.  The
mail now lives in:

MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL0	;oldest mail in foward order
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL1	;next oldest mail in foward order
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL2	;more of same
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL3	;yet more of same
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL4	;still more of same
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL	;recent mail in reverse order

Those of you who are wondering if Cube-Lovers might be temporarily off the
air when TCP is installed on January 1 can rest assured that there is an
ITS TPC implementation in progress, and come January 1 the ITS machines
will probably be no worse off than the rest of the net.  My biggest worry
is not that ITS won't be able to send mail (since I can always move the
list to another machine if that proves necessary), but that so many of you
all will be having difficulty recieving mail that I will be up to my neck
in error messages from various mailers around the net.

That is one of my reasons for splitting off a section of the archive at
this time.  I'm willing to bet that a fair number of you will be requesting
the back mail that you have missed during the storm at the beginning of the
year, and this way I have a small file that I can easily send off to you.

Finally let me remind you all to please address your requests to
Cube-Lovers-Request at MIT-MC.  If that address, or Cube-Lovers at MIT-MC
ever seems to be giving you trouble, you might also try Cube-Lovers at
MIT-Multics and Cube-Lovers-Request at MIT-Multics.
