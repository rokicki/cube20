From today's Boston Globe:

DOVER, Del.  ---  A massachusetts firm that claimed it had the first patent
on the Rubik's cube puzzle has won a patent infringement suit against CBS
Inc. and its subsidiary Ideal Toy Corp., which manufactures the puzzle.  US
District Court Judge Walter Stapleton issued the ruling Tuesday, validating
the patent held by Moleculon Research Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.  The ruling
said CBS infringed on the patent with its various Rubik's cube products.
Moleculon's attorney, Robert Perry, said if no appeal is filed, the case
would continue to a second trial to determine monetary damages.  Moleculon
is seeking $60 million in damages and an undetermined amount in profits
from Rubik's cube and related sales.
