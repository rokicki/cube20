Subject: 4x4x4 poll


  i am interested i getting information on the various solving methods
used on the 4x4x4, and the times that it is being done in. (average) 
my own method is to solve it as follows:

       1) top layer (no general order to this)
       2) the rest of the centers by layers 
       3) the edges on the center slices
       4) bottom corners
       5) bottom edges

 average time: 1 min 55 sec - 2 min 5 sec depending on my blood-alcohol level. 

   please send me your general method and solving times.
   i'll compile the results and put them on the list.

                                              thanks for replying,
                                                          -phil
