1 - I have an incomplete reference to a PUZZLE MUSEUM in the Wash DC area.  
Anybody have any details.
2  -  Is there any good (complete) mailorder catalog for puzzles.
3 -  "INTERLOCKING" CUBE,  this is a puzzle with 27 cubies held together in a
series connection by a rubber band.  The  joint that connects cubies is not
universal.  The cubies all have the same six colors, but not in the same
orientation.  THE OBJECT OF THE PUZZLE IS TO FOLD UP THE CUBIES to make a 3x3x3
cube with solid colored faces.  ANYBODY DONE THIS PUZZLE, ANY REFERENCES.
