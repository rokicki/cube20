  B.  size variations of 3x3x3 cube
  C.  shape variations of the 3x3x3 cube
  D.  NxN (N not 3) cubes and their relatives
  E.  other magic polyhedra
  F.  some other logical puzzles
  G.  various cube rel;ated products

THERE ARE MANY STICKER VARIATIONS; some are one to one subsitions of cubie
stickers,  some are pictures that cover a whole cube face, some are puzzles
(like the calendar cubes), some divide the coloring of cubies so that the 3x3x3
simulates other cubes (see Hofstadter's articles).  I have not seen any
references to Penrose Tiling cubie designs.

  B.  size variations of 3x3x3 cube
50mm, 38mm, 33mm, 31mm, 30mm, 25mm, 20mm - made into keychains and necklaces.

  C.  shape variations of the 3x3x3 cube
because the cubies always maintain the same in-out orientation relative to the
center of the cube, cubies can have any surface extension desired.  Therefore
there are cubes are spherical cubes, cubes with corner pieces trimmed to
equilateral triangles, some edge pieces are trimmed so that they make a single
plane presentation (eg, makes a barrel), I HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY THAT MAKE A
SOLID SCULPTURE OF THE CUBE, eg, a bust of RUBIK.
OCTAGONAL PRISM - four parallel edges are trimmed giving an octagonal prism, (CB
$8)
MEDIUM MAGIC GLOBE - Sold as Rubik's World, (CB or GH $10)

octahedron, (CB $8)
TETRAHEDRAL 2X2X2, each rotation axis runs through the centers of two opposite
edges, (CB $8)
STAR PUZZLE 2X2X2, similar to tetrahedron with a unicolored tetrahedron attached
to the center of the big tetrahedron.
TRICKHAUS 2X2X2, four edges are trimmed leaving a prism, can be arranged to look
