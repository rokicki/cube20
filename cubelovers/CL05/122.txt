On the other side, GPP is generally the *only* comprehensive games-hackers
store about and we would do well to go out of our way to patronize it.
I hardly care about the $5.00 one way or the other on something like
Magic, but where else can you get Monkey puzzles, and the Pentagle series
(are they still in business?  I haven't seen any new ones recently),
go/shogi sets/books, imported jigsaw puzzles and on and on.  If she doesn't
get a decent profit on the things she expects to sell a fair number of,
then she won't be able to stock the esoteric and fun stuff.
