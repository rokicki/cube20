Subject:  Cube-Lovers moves!
To: CUBE-LOVERS@AI.AI.MIT.EDU
Message-ID: <[AI.AI.MIT.EDU].27214.860415.ALAN>

The Cube-Lovers mailing list has moved from MIT-MC to MIT-AI.  All this
really means is that the archives are in a new place.  Sending mail to
Cube-Lovers@MIT-MC and Cube-Lover-Request@MIT-MC will still work, although
it will be infinitesimaly faster if you mail to Cube-Lovers@MIT-AI and
Cube-Lover-Request@MIT-AI instead.

(Please do not take this move as an opportunity to start spreading false
rumors about the status of MIT-MC.  I am moving Cube-Lovers from MC to AI
because I am -personally- moving to AI, and it is thus convenient for the
mailing list to move with me.  There will be a machine named MIT-MC for
years and years to come.)

For the record:  Old cube-lovers mail is archived on MIT-AI in the
following places:

AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL0	;oldest mail in forward order
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL1	;next oldest mail in forward order
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL2	;more of same
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL3	;still more of same
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL4	;yet more
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL	;recent mail in reverse order

Files can be FTP'd from MIT-AI without an account.  Unfortunately the
archives are way too large to be conveniently mailed by either computer or
physical mail.
