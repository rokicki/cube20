RE:  Paraphernalia, 19 aug 86

The book you are talking about is Sinmaster's
"Notes on Rubik's Cube".  It was available as you
describe in the 1981 time frame.  I believe it is 
currently avaialble in hardcover with an expanded
bibliography from "Enslow Publishers" .  They are 
located in northern NJ.  If you can't get their 
address send me a message and I will look it up
for you, if you just want the patterns and not the 
book I can send them to you since I have a copy
of the book.   They also have a second book by Singmaster
that was oriented towards teaching math concepts
with the cube.
