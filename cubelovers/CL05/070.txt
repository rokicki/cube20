1.  Does anyone know of anywhere I can obtain any of the following
    puzzles:
           skewb
           pyraminx crystal
           pyraminx ball
           pyraminx ultimate
           double pyramid

2. I would very much like to obtain copies of Singmaster's Cubic
   Circular. I have the first 4 issues, but saw a reference to there
   being 8 volumes. I would be glad to pay for copying and postage. Can
   anyone help?

3. Does anyone know the status of Meffert's Puzzle Club?

4. Do Singmaster or Doug Hofstadter have net addresses?


   Thanks for any help.
