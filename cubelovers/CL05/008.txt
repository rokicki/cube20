From "Special Deliverance" a recent novel by Clifford Simak:

   "He also mentioned a cube," said Sandra.  "I wonder what it could be.
   Never before have I heard anything described simply as a cube."

Well I certainly have!

(And no, the book actually has nothing to do with Hungarian Cubes.  It just
struck me as strange that someone could write that line at a time when an
object that frequently WAS described simply as "the cube" was enjoying some
popularity.  Perhaps Sandra's ignorance is excusable in light of the fact
that she comes from an alternate universe...)
