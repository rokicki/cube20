I bought a book about four years ago in Boston that had procedures for
generating all sorts of patterns on the 3x3 cube.  I think it was about
five to ten 8-1/2 x 11" pieces of paper folded in half and stapled to
form a book.  The cover was blue paper.

Unfortunately, I lost it moving about half a year after that.  By that
time I guess interest in the cube was waning; I have not been able to
find another copy.  If anyone else has a copy or just knows where to
find them, could you please post it to this newsgroup?  I thought it
was quite a find, and think no cube lover should be without one.
