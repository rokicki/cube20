Rubik's magic was available at the local Sears (Palo Alto/Mtn View) for
around $8, but they are out of stock now.  It is currently available
at Norney's in the same mall for around $13.

A few 5x5x5 Rubik's cubes were available at Games and Things in the
Stanford shopping center about a week ago for around $20.
