RE:  Slocum's book.
I have not read it yet but I have ordered a copy and hope to be able to answer
your questions soon.  In issue #6 of "World Game Review" (avaialble for $8 for 4
issues from Michael Keller, 3367-I North Chatam Road, Ellicott City, MD 21043)
Slocum's book is reviewed.  It says that this book is a collaboration with Jack
Botermans author of "creative puzzles of the world" which was the best puzzle
book but is now out of print.  The new book has much of the older books material
on mechanical puzzles plus new material.  The book was liked in general.
