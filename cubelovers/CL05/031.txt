    	What about the 5x5x5 that somebody reported having
    	actually touched, anyone seen any on sale?
        It will never be sold in mass.  
    What, pray tell, are the details and source of this information?
    As if there were anything I could do with it other than stare at it...
A person at Games People Play believes Ideal will never produce a
5x5x5 commercially.  He believes the only people that seriously
bouhght the 4x4x4 were those that solved the 3x3x3 without a solution
book.  He finally said he is stuck with many 4x4x4 that he fears he
won't be able to get rid of.  The economics of making a 5x5x5 just
don't sound very good.
