Subject: BITNET Redistribution of Cube-Lovers
To: Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU
Message-ID: <861203170452.2.ALAN@PIGPEN.AI.MIT.EDU>

I'm looking for someone on BITNET to volunteer to maintain a BITNET
redistribution list for the Cube-Lovers mailing list.  This is necessary
because the machine that's acting as the Internet/BITNET gateway,
WISCVM.WISC.EDU, is swamped with mailing list mail.  List administrators
(like me) are being asked to set up redistribution lists to help lighten
the load.  If we can set one up for Cube-Lovers then WISCVM will only have
to relay each message to one host instead of the current 20 or so.

If you're willing and able to take this on, please let me know.
