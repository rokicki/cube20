    Several months have gone by without a word from this list.
    Have we lost our interest (or have I been removed from the
    list)!??  
I don't know that much of interest has happened.  Maybe I'll find
a little time some year and try a couple things. 
    What about the 5x5x5 that somebody reported having
    actually touched, anyone seen any on sale?
It will never be sold in mass.  MANY stores are stuck with 4x4x4s
that nobody will buy.
