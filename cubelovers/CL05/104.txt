I have been a cube person for 5 or 6 years now and I am upset by the almost
total disappearance of the cube and its asociated memorabilia and paraphernalia.
 Therefore, I propose to establish a "CUBE EXCHANGE" to buy, sell and trade cube
items in suport of the greater development of cubing.   To this end it will be
necessary to catalog what was available, what is avaiable and from whom it can
be obtained.  Your assistance in this endeavor will be much appreciated,
including pointers through the archives.  So far I have located a source for
3x3x3 cubes (solid colors, card suits, flowers, numbers, domino dots, fruits,
sports balls, and ball).  Your assistance in who has what for sale would also be
much appreciated.
