    I remember hearing about a program, probably running on the color LISP
    machine, that could take an arbitrary cube and try to see what the
    shortest move sequence to its slution is.  Does anyone remember where
    this program is and how to use it?

Sorry, no such program.  Don't we wish though!!  If we understood
the mathematics of the cube well enough to write such a program,
we probably wouldn't have this mailing list anymore.
