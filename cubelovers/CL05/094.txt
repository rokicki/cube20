I never really asked to be, but I seem to be a member of Meffert's
Puzzler's Club.  The latest mailing offers several individual items plus
a Christmas special:  9 skewbs plus 9 5x5x5 cubes for US$99 registered
airmail or $US82 registered surface mail.

It says the individual prices are $25 for the 5x5x5 and $15 for the
Skewb, so this is said to be a $360 value.

If you're like me, you're the only cube-lover among those you exchange
gifts with.  But if you happen to have several cube-lovers on your list,
maybe this can solve your shopping worries.

The offer is "limited to December 15, 1985"  All orders should have
"bankdraft or money order in US Dollar Currency".  The address is:
