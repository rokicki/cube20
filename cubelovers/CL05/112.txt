    The blue-covered book that Paul (pm@harvard.HARVARD.EDU) refers to is
    probably David Singmaster's pamphlet Notes_on_Rubik's_'Magic_Cube'.  It
    is 60 pages long, and includes sections on the basic mathematical
    problem, some of the simple subgroups, pretty patterns, algorithms to
    restore the cube in the shortest number of moves.  
It most certainly made no claim to minimal algorithms.  Minimal
cube algorithms are still an unsolved problem.
						       It lists many
    processes for flipping and rotating edges and corners.

    If the book is still in print, it is available from
