It is possible to solve the corners of the Rubik's Cube in no more
than 11 turns.  Over 4/5 of all possible patterns can be solved in
9 turns or fewer, but over half take a full 9 turns.  Ten turns are
enough to solve more than 99.9% of all scrambled states.  (Only
2,644 states require 11 turns).
 
This from L. John Kelley, solver of the Magic Pyramid.
