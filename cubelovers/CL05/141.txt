RE:  Buz Owen's request for a source for 5x5x5 cubes

1.  Jerry Slocum

     Beverly Hills, CA 90212
     213/273-2270
has both 5x5x5s and skewbs available for $20 each.

2. Jerry Slocum has also authored a book "Puzzles Old and New, How to make and
Solve Them" which he sells for $22 outside of CA, autographed if requested.  
The table of contents is:

chap 3  INTERLOCKING SOLID PUZZLES - Disassembly and assembly is required to
solve the puzzle.
chap 4  DISENTANGLEMENT PUZZLES - The puzzle is to disentangle and re-entangle
the parts of the puzzle.
chap 5  SEQUENTIAL MOVEMENT PUZZLES -  The puzzle is to move parts of the object
to a goal (The cube, et al)

3.  Richard Hess
     4100 Palos Verdes Dr. East
     Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90274
has available for sale many of the puzzles from Jerry Slocum's book.

4.  Another book of interest is:

        1967 by Charles Scribner's Sons
        Library of Congress Catalog Card NUmber 67-15488.

5.  There are sources for other variations of the cube, if anybody is interested
I will compile a list.
