Several years ago, when Cubes were a big rage, the great volume of mail
sent to this mailing list forced us into making it into a digest.  For most
of the last few years the list has been fairly low-volume, nevertheless I
have refrained from converting the list back to direct-distribution because
some of the messages sent directly to Cube-Lovers were really add-me
requests.  Now I find that I am experiencing a new phenomena:  There is a
growing tendency for people to address replies to messages I forward to
Cube-Lovers to -me-, rather than to the original sender.  This is a bit of
a pain for me, so as of right now, I am converting Cube-Lovers back to
direct-distribution.

Let me take this opportunity to remind you of two bits of administrative
trivia:

1.  Please continue to send all administrative requests (like if you want
    to get off of the list) to Cube-Lovers-Request@MIT-MC.

2.  Old cube-lovers mail is archived in the following places:

    MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL0	;oldest mail in forward order
    MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL1	;next oldest mail in forward order
    MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL2	;more of same
    MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL3	;still more of same
    MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL	;recent mail in reverse order

    Files can be FTP'd from MIT-MC without an account.
