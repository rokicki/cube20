1.  MY direct MSG TO BUZ OWEN was not delivered (RE: 5x5x5 availability).  If
anybody out there knows him or how to forward the msg to him (he is not on the
cube lovers list) please do so.
 
2.  It will take a bout a week but I will compile a list where and what is
available in the world of cubes.  It will be the highlights from Helm's
, Bandelow's, Hess's and Beck's supplies.  If you want a complete classification
guide request it separately and I will mail you a copy of Bandelow's collection
or if you are more patient wait for Cecil Smith to complete his book.  Please be
patient.  If you are looking for a specific cube let me know I can get you that
answer faster.
