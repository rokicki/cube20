On July 15 I sent a check for $20 to Christoph Bandelow in Germany, and I got 
my cube sometime last week.  He also sent me a letter in which he says,
    I shall be at the International Congress of Mathematicians at
    Berkeley this August 2 - 10 with most of my "cubes". After the
    congress and some travelling time, that is in September, I will
    send you my then updated catalogue - but I hope I can sell the
    complete rest in Berkeley.
If you happen to be around Berkeley this week, it might be worth checking out.
If he sends a catalog with anything in it, I will post info.
