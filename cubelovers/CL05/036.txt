A bizarre variant of the "bricks" described by Isaacs last week is
currently sitting on the front desk of the SIPB office at MIT.  Imagine
that you took three cubies along any edge of a cube and welded them
together (perhaps by taping over the cracks as Singmaster suggests).  Now
imagine that you perform the same mutilation on a second cube.  Now imagine
that you arrange to \share/ the same 1 x 1 x 3 cubie between the two cubes.
The resulting arrangement looks like this from above:

XXX
XXX
XXXXX
  XXX
  XXX

A moment's thought should convince you that sharing the 1 x 1 x 3 cubie has
done \nothing/ to increase the difficulty of the puzzle.  Amazing what
lengths puzzle manufacturers will go to to try and squeeze a few more bucks
out of the Cube Craze.
