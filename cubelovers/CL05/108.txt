CUBE AVAILABILITY:

1.  REVENGE - on 21 aug 86 I bought a revenge for
$1.99 at the KAY BEE toy store in the Gallery mall,
phila, pa. NOTE: kay bee is a national chain, so check
your area if interested.

2.  GLOBE PUZZLE -  This is a 3x3x3  sphere with the
following difference,  the edge pieces are broken 
into two pieces. Thus the edges and centers are 
interchangeable.  (does this make it a planar puzzle,
for edges and centers)  I haven't received mine yet.  Is 
there any discussion of this variant in the archives.
AVAILABLE from:  the nature company
