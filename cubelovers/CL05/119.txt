Rubik's Magic is available at "Games people play" near Harvard Square
for a little under $15.  As with Beck, it took me about 4 days to solve
it.  My resulting solution is strickingly simple (3 macros), but I took
a lot of interesting paths to get there.  I think it could have been
made harder be repainting the back surface, but doing so may take it out
of the reach of the general public.  (It would require solving it to an
intermediate configuration that doesn't look anywhere near solved, and
then frob it again.)

It's a good puzzle for playing with and relieving the fidgets.
Mathematically it isn't very interesting, nor are there any "pretty
patterns" other than solved1 and solved2.
