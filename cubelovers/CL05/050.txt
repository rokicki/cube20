Subject:  Recent Activity?

Is this mailing list still alive? Does anyone know of any
recent activity in the cube world? Are there still any
Cube Newsletters that anyone knows of? Has anyone ever seen
any of the many puzzles I read about in places such as 'Scientific American' and 'Omni', ex.
the Skewb, the Double Pyramid, the 5x5x5 cube, etc.?
