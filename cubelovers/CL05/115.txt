RE:  msg from Randel Shane requesting clarification of the  "INTERLOCKING" CUBE
PUZZLE, 
 this is a puzzle with 27 cubies held together in a series connection by a
rubber band, like a snake.  
The cubies faces each have a different color, ie, 6 per cubie.  The blue and
green colors are along the connecting axis while the red,white,yellow and orange
colors are parallel to the connecting axis.  The cubbies are not all identical. 

The  joint that connects cubies is not universal.  The joint is made by a slot
in the blue and green faces.  These slots are perpendicular to each other.  This
is limits the possible orientations.
THE OBJECT OF THE PUZZLE IS TO FOLD UP THE CUBIES to make a 3x3x3 cube with six
solid colored faces.  
HAS ANYONE DONE THIS PUZZLE, ANY REFERENCES.

PS Randell, I hope this description is somewhat better.  If you would like to
see it first hand I can send you one for $2.  

PPS I need a better ARPANET address to send you msgs directly.
