Anyone have a written solution algorithm for the 5-by-5-by-5 cube?  I
got mine a year and a half or so ago from Meffert in Hong Kong by mail
order.  After a couple of weeks of just trying out "pretty patterns" on
it, I finally got up the nerve to mess it up.  Well, of course, it's
never been altogether solved since.  (I was never a great cube wizard.)
It sits on display as the base of my cube tower, with those few nagging
cubies out of place.  I haven't touched it in many months.
