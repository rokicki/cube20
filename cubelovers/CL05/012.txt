I remember hearing about a program, probably running on the color LISP
machine, that could take an arbitrary cube and try to see what the
shortest move sequence to its slution is.  Does anyone remember where
this program is and how to use it?

Specifically, I have been given the following cube and asked to find
the shortest solution:

    GBG
    BGW
    GGG
RRR WYW ORO YYY
ORO GWY OOO WYB
RRR WWW ORO YWY
    BBB
    GBY
    BGB

If anyone can either find the program I think I remember, or can
determine what they think is the shortest solution, I'd be \very/
grateful!  Speed is of the essence.

Thanx much, everyone!
