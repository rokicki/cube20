1.  MY MSG TO BUZ OWEN was not delivered (RE: 5x5x5 availability).  If anybody out there knows him or how to forward the msg to him (he is not on the cube lovers list) please do so.

2.  It will take a bout a week but I will compile a list where and what is available in the world of cubes.  It will be a compilation of Helm's 
, Bandelow's, Hess's and Beck's supplies.  Please be patient.  If you are looking for a specific cube let me know I can get you that answer faster.
