This came Tuesday (spelling and grammar as you see it).  See my comments
at the end.

	Dear Sirs,
	
	It has come to my attention that apparently quite a lot 
	of the puzzles we sent to Puzzlers Club members were not 
	received by them.  Upon careful investigation of this matter, 
	it now appears that they were confiscated by the Customs who 
	must have thought at the time that they were Taiwan copies.  
	As we did send the goods and paid the Airmail postage and 
	then had so many claims to send the goods a second and third 
	time, the Puzzlers Club suffered a very big loss and 
	consequently had to closed down.
	
	Due to the suppressed Puzzle market, we are not producing new 
	Puzzles at this time.  However, we will be releasing later this 
	year the "I.Q. DIE" which is the Skewb with Die markings, and a 
	Game called 'King/Ace'.  It is the Pyraminx without the 4 apexes,
	decorated in the 4 Card Suits, the Game is similar to Back-Jack.  
	The "I.Q. DIE" and 'King/Ace' including instructions are now 
	available to Ex-Puzzlers Club members and collectors at US$25 
	each including registered Airmail postage.
	
	Also a few 5 x 5 cubes and Regular Skewbs, Timber finished 
	Pyraminx and Immposi-ball are still available as per price list 
	below, including registered Airmail postage.  A copy of the 
	registered receipt will be sent by separate airmail.  Stocks, 
	however are limited, as there will be no additional production 
	for several years at least.
	
	Please let me know if you wish some of the above items.  I do 
	apologize if you were one of the unfortunate ones who were 
	affected by the customs action.
	
	However if you would like to send us your new order with payment, 
	I personally guarantee that you will get the goods this time.  
	(The customs have been notified that we are the legal copyright 
	holder.)
	
	Once again my apologizes for any inconvenience caused.
	
	With warm regards,
	
	Mr Uwe Meffert

It was accompanied by one color page (sloppily torn out of a brochure)
containing pictures of the puzzles.

Well, I'm one of those who got burned, though I never was a member of
the Puzzlers Club.  In January 1983, I sent Meffert a Cashier's Check
for a Skewb.  I followed up by letter late that Spring.  In Summer '83,
I paid for and received very promptly a 5x5x5 cube from him.  In January
1984, I wrote a second letter about the missing Skewb.  I never got the
Skewb nor any replies to my letters until this arrived!  So now it's all
the  (U.S.) government's fault.  Hmph.  (Maybe I should attend those
occasional Customs sales I've heard about!)

I'm just a Skewb-hungry sucker, for I'm going to try again.  But I'm not
very reassured by his "personal guarantee".  What good will that do me?
The man doesn't even answer his mail.  Oh, well.  Order at your own
risk.
