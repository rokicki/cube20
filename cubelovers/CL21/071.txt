 Around 1985, I think, I was browsing through a book by Douglas
Hofstadter, most likely his _Metamagical Themas_; buried deep within it
was a comment (I think without attribution) that a prototype of the 6-cube
had been built, and a paper design for the 7-cube existed. Digging through
the archives for this mailing list might also yield something.

 He also said that almost all the Magic Dodecahedrons had been melted down
for their plastic, because each one used about $2 worth. This is one of
the sadder pieces of news I have heard.

 Does anyone know whether Uwe M=E8ffert (Meffert, if your char. set isn't
ISO 8859-1 compatible [See Moderator's Note]) is still in business? He's
Swiss, and was (and might still be) primarily an aquaculturist.

 The 6-cube would be fun to manipulate and solve, but what I'd really love
to see is its innards! The insides of the 5-cube are awe-inspiring...

[ Moderator's Note: Actually, I would prefer it if people didn't use
  extended ISO 8859 characters (or MIME, or PGP) in sending messages to
  Cube-Lovers.  This message got to the Cube-Lovers inbox quite mangled
  because of the presence of an 8-bit character in Meffert's name.  I undid
  the damage, and I agree that this -should- just have worked, and perhaps
  someday soon it -will-, but for now, it just doesn't work.  The the
  extent that it is possible, I request that Cube-Lovers subscribers stick
  to submitting messages formatted in plain ASCII.  Thanks!  - Alan ]
