  Although it is may be one hand move, R2 takes longer than R, if we
start thinking that way, I suggest to give different values te each move
(ie: R=1 R2=1.3 R'=1.2 L'=1 L=1.2 ...) depending on how long it would
take to make that move, it could also depend on the previous move...
  We could have an 'efficiency coeficient' of a given formula, but I 
guess that would depend on many subjective factors (ie: if you are right
or left-handed). I disagree with that, in our own cube meetings we used
to have back in '82 (I was 18 then), we accepted the Q method cause it
gave a lot of coherence in ALL formulas, and I'm not a mathemacian or
group theorist, (a program will probably do R2=R+R+ taking exactly twice
the time of one single move), eventually I rather put both counts in
parenthesis, but I definetely choose the Q method. (Look at the samples
in my 30/6 mail, I have a LOT more)
