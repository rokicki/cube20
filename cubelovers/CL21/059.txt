Subject: Re: Rubik's Tangles

Someone (I've deleted the message) recently asked about the Tangles.
My recollection is that the four puzzles are all the same except for
permutations of the colors.  That is, each Tangle consists of the 24
possible distinct pieces, plus one duplicated piece.  Which piece is
duplicated varies, but the resulting puzzles are the same.  (Oh yeah,
the pattern of the crossing ropes on each tile is also the same for
each puzzle.)  Really disappointing, especially since I think there
were two distinct solutions, and if they'd varied the mix a bit more
they could've had unique solutions as well as having four truly
different puzzles.

Also, another fellow and I independently did some analyses about three
years ago that proved that you cannot make a 10x10 using the four
combined puzzles.  Presumably the marketing blurb that suggests doing
so was written by someone who had no clue whether it was possible or
not.  Again, if they'd varied the puzzles a bit I have no doubt they
could've made the 10x10 achievable as well.
