 (My subject line is a spur-of-the-moment phrase; not deeply considered.)

 I just got to wondering whether some people have considered theoretical
larger analogs of the Magic Domino (btw, would somebody please manufacture
some Magic Dominoes? Binary Arts?). To get back on topic, these would be
Cube-like puzzles with such "cubie counts" ("Dimensions") as 3X3X4, 3X4X4,
etc. Whether these are trivial, I haven't yet thought out; making real,
physical ones might not be simple. If this topic is covered in the
archives, I apologize; in such a case, could someone recommend non-obvious
keywords or names? 

 Is there an agreed-upon concise way of defining the
"size/count/dimensions" of a Cube; i.e., a 2X2X2 is a Pocket Cube, a 4...
is Rubik's Revenge, etc.? How about "order-3" for a regular Rubik's, or
simply (given proper context) "n", so that "2" signifies Pocket, "4"
Revenge, etc.? Perhaps it's just a personal reaction, but I find it
cumbersome to type "5X5X5" more than a few times, for instance.

 Thinking about this brings up another topic, and probably a difficult one
to completely characterize. Given any arbitrary puzzle composed of cubies,
is it always possible to create a mechanism to realize that specific
puzzle physically?

 As far as I know (and here I stick my neck waaaaay out!), there is no
theory of mechanisms in the general case that would, for instance, say
whether an order-2 is realizable (as we know, it can be made, and has
been); the Magic Domino is more of a challenge, imho, in that it isn't as
easy to say whether such a structure can be made. 

 Some matters affecting realizability are relatively easy to anticipate,
such as the matter of holding the corner cubies in place in a "7"  (with
all cubies of equal size) when one plane is rotated with respect to the
other six. Other matters are a question of what's reasonable to design
mechanically; while theoretically possible, some structures might not be
at all practical, because of such problems as cumulative friction, lack of
rigidity, and dimensional tolerances. Such real-world considerations
(unfortunately!) muddy the waters until a really good mind comes along to
settle the mud.

 A preliminary guess at an answer to the question is that probably all
"low-order" collections of cubies are realizable, but we are far from
having a theory of mechanisms that tells us how to design the innards.

 I maintain that the mechanism of the ordinary Rubik's Cube is the most
ingenious simple one ever invented; I have studied mechanisms to a fair
degree. (A good competitor is the programmable pushbutton combination lock
that has five buttons in a row. This is mechanical, digital, programmable,
combinatorial, and sequential.)

Hope and trust this hasn't been a waste of bitspace!
