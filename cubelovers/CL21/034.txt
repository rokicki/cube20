 Here's hoping that this "stream of consciousness with revisions" style is
acceptable!:

 I can conceive of such a structure, but whether it could be made to work
decently is quite open to doubt. It would have a great many pieces; the
whole top layer would have to consist of cubies with two physical parts,
one that would travel to its new location, and the other which would
remain behind.  Holding the whole works together while rotating it is
difficult enough, but reliably reattaching the two parts of each cubie
once the rotation was complete is borderline crazy!

 Of course, all edge and corner cubies would need to be two-part.

 If someone is ambitious enough to attempt such a design, it would be very
costly and out of the question for mass production.

 It might help if a tool (such as a Torx (TM) wrench) were provided to
insert into both "face-center" cubies (or the common corner cubie) to
unlock the top layer from its underlying parts and to lock the top-layer
cubies together. However, just a clamping frame to hold the top layer
together would make sense, IMO. 

 A strictly-mechanical solution is at least borderline impractical, but
shrewd design with rare-earth magnets might help.

 Dismantle a regular Cube to see what would be involved. An edge cubie has
a "foot" that extends below the top layer, as does a corner cubie. These
"feet" would have to be left behind once a move began.

 It's really nice to have all the unlocking and reattaching taken care of
"automatically" by just the twisting shear force created by gripping the
Siamese Cube, but for such a move as this, that's a formidable luxury.

 If I were an experienced mechanical engineer, I'd say it just isn't
practical. However, it is great fun to think of how it could be done. (If
e-mail had a universal graphics format, illustrations would be nice, but I
honestly don't feel that ambitious!) I also suspect that when it came time
to design in detail, new conceptual problems would arise which might be
extremely difficult to overcome. Consider, for instance, that if you don't
use a clamping frame, the mere act of locking the top layer together has
to hold the corner cubies in place. The locking pieces need to be operated
by sliding members passing through the neighboring edge cubies, and that's
not all, by far.

 My regards to all,
