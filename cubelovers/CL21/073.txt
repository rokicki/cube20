Are you referring to center-slice non-face-center cubies?  If so, well,
"duh, I missed that".  Dunno why it didn't register on me that the
5-Cube is the first one with such cubies, but it is.

I suppose it's just that to me, all eight non-face-center face cubies
on the 5-Cube "feel the same", so I didn't notice the difference.
(That's also why I think the "new" face cubies on the 6-Cube will not
be a challenge.  What algorithm _are_ you referring to?)

True, of course; putting a picture (or equivalent) on the face of the
Cube makes anything above the 2-Cube at least somewhat harder.  But
AFAICT this doesn't explain your first statement, about needing a new
algorithm for the 5-Cube....
