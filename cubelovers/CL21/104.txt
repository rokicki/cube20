Subject: Cube stickers

	It's distressing to hear that the current cube stickers come off.
This was not a real problem with older cubes, except for the orange stickers
of the 5x5x5.  I found that one can buy plastic sheets from artist's
supply shops.  These have sticky backs, on a plastic backing, like peel-off
labels.  I found one could get quite a selection of colors and they adhered
quite well.
