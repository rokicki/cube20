Suggestion for lost stickers:

2.  Make a bandaged cube in the style of Dieter Gebhardt or Greg Stevens'
works, and make suitable stickers yourself for the bandaged cube.

1.  Before bandaging the cube in step 2, first you must remove the original
stickers.  Put some of them on the cube that is missing stickers, and save
the others to take care of future losses.

0.  Choose a cube that is already missing the most stickers, and use that
one in making the bandaged cube.

Notice that there is no step 3.  If you do an adequate job of bandaging, it
will be incredibly difficult to solve the cube after messing it up.  So there
is no step 3.  Do not post to this list asking for help in solving it :-)
