Hello cube lovers:
 
Several things:
1. I have written computer programs in maple
for (a) the skewb,(b) the rainbow masterball,
(c) the 3x3 Rubik's cube, and (d) the 4x4 Rubik's
cube. You must have maple (http://www,maplesoft.com)
to run it and the program simulates any move of one of 
the above puzzles using maple's 3-d graphics. The idea is
that, using one of these programs, you can
"virtually" make a move, the program draws the
cube in 3-space, and maple allows you to rotate
the cube around with your mouse (assuming you have 
the windows version of maple).
  These programs do not solve the puzzle, only
simulates the moves. It appears to be possible, with
some work, to link these programs with gap to
provide a solution as well, but I don't have the
time to do that.

2. Andrew Southern from London (whom I've lost touch with) 
and I worked out a fairly simple collection of moves to 
help solve the rainbow masterball. These are available.
   Apparently 2-cycle exist on the masterball, unlike
the Rubik's cube. We do not know of a relatively
short expression for one. If anyone out there knows
of one please let me know.

3. This stuff can be found on my www page

http://www.nadn.navy.mil/MathDept/wdj/myhome.html

under "computer programs" and "Rubik's cube like
puzzles". If there are any problems loading them
I'll try to help.
                          - David

PS: FYI, Ishi Press International has moved recently.
They are having a puzzle sale as well (their phone is
(800)859-2086 or (415)323-6996). I think they have
some cheap skewbs. Also, on a recent business
trip I stopped by Puzzletts store in downtown
Seattle - the best puzzle or game store I've ever seen.
Their www address has been posted recently
in this list so I won't repeat it.
