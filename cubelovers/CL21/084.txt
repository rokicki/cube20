Sounds like you have what I know as a "Truncated Cube", although I'm not
sure if that's the 'official' name.  The Magic Dodecahedron has 12 sides,
each in the shape of a pentagon.  Magic Dodecahedron's are available from
Dr. Christoph Bandelow for 35DM.  He has a variety of "cube puzzles" - for
a catalog, request to: Dr. Christoph Bandelow, An der Wabeck 37, D-58456
Witten, GERMANY.
