Yes, a 5-Cube exists; I own one.  And yes, if you can solve the 3-Cube
and the 4-Cube, no higher order presents any qualitatively new
challenges to a human.  In theory, the 6-Cube would, because it's the
first one that has one-visible-face cubies that are not on a plane of
symmetry.  The 5-Cube has a 3x3 grid of one-face cubies on each face,
but they are all either (a) face center, (b) non-(a) center slice, or
(c) non-(a) face diagonal.  On the 4-Cube, the four one-face cubies are
all face diagonal, and on the 3-Cube, there's only one (face center)
one-face cubie.  However, at least based on my own experience, I
believe that these new cubies on the 6-Cube will not add any additional
challenge - the one-face cubies are one of the easiest parts of the
cube anyway, and the same basic operations that work for the (c) cubies
on the 4-Cube (and the (b) and (c) cubies on the 5-Cube) will work
equally well for these new cubies.

Incidentally, does anyone know if a physical 6-Cube has ever been made?
If so, and it's not too outrageously priced, I'd be interested in
buying one.
