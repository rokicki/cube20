Well I was on the right track long ago, but now I have confirmation.

The megaminx has a slice group, analagous to the cube slice group.
All the possible spot patterns are in the megaminx's slice group,
e.g. the 10 spot and the 12 spot patterns. With process M1 we may
easily generate any spot pattern, although there is much room
for improvement.

The slice group of the megaminx is generated by turning the faces
opposite to each other in the same direction (i.e. same direction
looking at a face head-on!)

It is a small enough group to seach from head to tail, although
the exact details are still being worked on.

In the case of process M1, L is opposite to R, not just separated
by a face F, as in processes M2 and M3.

My original diagram is rather limited, but it does illustrate the
idea of L & R separated by F only (as opposed to a real opposites
but I have no satisfactory notation).

Moves for the Magic Dodecahedron (Megaminx)
-------------------------------------------

C_U = Rotate entire dodecahedron clockwise via the U face
suffix notation: f = face turns
                 u = unit turns

M1 10 spot   (L1 R3 C_U)^36    (slice group)                    (72f)

M2 3 cycle of edges (uf, lf, rf)
              R+ F+ U+ F- U- R- L- U- F- U+ F+ L+               (12f)

M3 2 flip     L-- R++ F+  U-  R+  U+  L++ R++ U+                (18f, 26u)
