Subject: Rubik's Cube mailing list

I would be interested in descriptions of algorithms and heuristics used
for solutions of the Rubik's Cube problem.  I have a copy of the Rubik's
Math book in which (Freimaster?) the author describes some computer
work done in England or Wales (was it Thistlewaite?)  There seemed to be
no way to contact the author, trace the paper, and even a letter to the
publishers of the book go no clues to the "newsletter" mentioned.

It would be a great benefit to find out more about these computer methods.
A portion of my dissertation work is based on search over the Rubik's cube
domain.

What is the status of the legal dispute?  I was able to buy a cube in a regular
store a short while ago, after apparently being absent for many years.
