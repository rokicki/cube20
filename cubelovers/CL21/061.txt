At first I used ordinary candles. It works fine, but you have to redo
it twice a week if you twist a lot. Later I heard that Silicon Spray
is the best, and I have used it ever since.

The odd thing about it is that for the first few minutes of turning, it
almost GLUES the cube together. It gets VERY hard to turn. The cubes in the
swedish championship were greased with silicon, but not "turned soft", so
it was really hard. Since I had learned the cube with a REALLY bad cube
(there was a shortage of hungarian cubes for months at that time), I had
a big advantage at that competition.
