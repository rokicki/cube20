Not much.  I find that the only technique that seems to slow down the
sticker-losing is:

1) Don't let anybody else play with it.  Greasy and oily hands damage
 the glue, and every once in a while you'll run into some idiot who 
 will try to impress you by removing the stickers and putting them
 back on in order.

Probably cost.  Ideal made "Rubik's Game" and the Deluxe "Rubik's Cube"
a while ago, both which had plastic faces and were much more durable.

Unfortunately, no such equivalent was ever produced for the higher-order
cubes; I've already lost three 4x4x4 stickers and one 5x5x5 sticker.

I know the feeling.   Your best bet is not to worry about it, and
to produce your own replacement stickers.
