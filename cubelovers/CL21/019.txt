I think the best book is Bandelow's Inside Rubik's cube and beyond,
which might be in a local library. I have lecture notes for a
course I'm teaching on the Rubik's cube which I can send you
for free. Also, a group-theorist friend of mine has several
hundred copies of an elementary group theory book (printed
by the US government and I think free) available - you can
email me or him (Prof Gaglione, amg@nadn.navy.mil) if you're
interested. Finally, Puzzletts is still selling Singmaster's 
Notes on the Rubik's cube, though they are also out of
print. - David Joyner
