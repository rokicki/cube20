  Over the last several days I noticed a number of posts about people
experimenting with moves and different combinations of moves on
the cube, using different notation. I just thought I'd mention
a java applet a wrote for a class. The applet allows you to
enter moves in Singmaster notation and view the results on a cube.
The applet uses fairly standard notation, and I put rather complete
instructions on the page. It was fun to write, and neat to play
with. If you are interesting in finding out new moves, give it
a try. Just playing around, making stuff up, I came up with
(r^b[u,l^f]r^b)^4, which uses commutators, conjugates and exponentiation,
and translaes to (fu,lu,lr) (I think that's the right answer, but I'm
not sure how it's written. Basically the move switches around three
edges). The applet also supports capital letter moves, which is a 
clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the whole cube, reorienting
which face is f,l,r.. etc. Read the instructions and enjoy. The

Tell me what you think and what needs clarification.
