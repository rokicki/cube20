I once set about building a 5x5 rubiks clock, but I never got round to
finishing it as I realised that I already knew how to solve the general NxN
clock.

I did get around to building a 32x2 Rubik's Magic, that's eight Rubiks
Magics built into one array. It required a couple of customised inlays (i.e.
I cut and pasted), and is still prone to misalignment and deligamentation
(i.e. it falls apart a bit), but it works and the solution is just an
extended version of the 4x2. It takes me about half an hour to solve, and is
the equivelent of a good work out, that's why I haven't used it since I was
about 14! 

I only used it to get one above the guys at school that could do the magic
(4x2) in about one second, because I could never get any faster than 2 seconds!

The smallest "Rubik's Magic" I've ever custom built was a 2x1, most people
didn't have any problem with that one!

Has anyone else ever extrapulated a puzzle to form a "Custom Master Edition"?

I'd be interested to hear.

I think there was also Rubik's Illusion, which was a game of chess using
some sort of complex mapping.
