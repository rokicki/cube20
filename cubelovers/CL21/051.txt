Subject: Directory of Puzzlers

I received the following note from Jerry Slocum, which he asked me to pass
on to Cube-Lovers if I though it was appropriate.  I see nothing wrong with
it, so here it is.

But let me take this opportunity to request that people -not- send things
to Cube-Lovers-Request and ask that I forward them on to Cube-Lovers --
that just makes more work for me.  Please just send what you want to go to
Cube-Lovers to Cube-Lovers.  If you feel the need to make some explanation
to Cube-Lovers-Request, send a separate message to Cube-Lovers-Request.

Thanks!  - Alan
