 Have you tried Puzzletts?  As to getting a 1980s Cube, try to get one
with attached colored plastic tiles instead of stickers, made by Ideal. 
Its mechanical design differs in certain details, so that it is to some
degree self-aligning, and much less likely to lock if slightly misaligned.
It is also made of what's probably the best (affordable!) plastic for this
application.  It might have been called a "Deluxe" Cube.

 It's possible that the store in Cambridge, Mass. called "The Games People
Play" might have 1990s Cubes in stock; I tend to think the superior kind
is probably history, but one can always hope. (Sorry! I have just one, and
I'm not selling it!)

I'm reasonably sure that Puzzletts is at http://www.puzzletts.com
