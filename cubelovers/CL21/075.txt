I don't think either part of that is true.  I'm nearly certain that the
magic dodecahedron is still in Dr. Bandelow's catalog.  Although to be
pendantic, I believe Meffert's company was in Hong Kong, so the $2 value
of plastic might be accurate in Hong Kong dollars.

1.  Maybe around 10 years ago, I read that his company went bankrupt.

2.  The world's largest country uses a language which can't be written
using ISO 8859-1 compatible characters.  So do some neighboring countries.
The world's second-largest country has a small fraction of its population
well educated in a language which can be written using those characters,
but its most commonly used language (and most of its languages) cannot be.
