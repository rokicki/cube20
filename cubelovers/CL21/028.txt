If I remember well the limit was not order 5 but 6, and not due to
the mechanism but only because during turning the corner cubes will
extend so much outside the cube that they are held by only 2 neighbours.
*But* this holds only if your requirement is that all cubelets have the
same size.  When you allow cubelets to grow when going from the center
you can get larger (although I think even in that case there will be
a limit, right now I am too lazy to think about it even further).
