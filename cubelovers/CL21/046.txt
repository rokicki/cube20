I have solved the Rubiks Clock.
I also have the Rubiks Illusion.

It is like 4-in-a-row game, but you need 5-in-a-row, using a mirror (which is
connected to the back of the board) as another part of the board.

There are 3 types of pieces.  RED, YELLOW and RED/YELLOW.

These can be used to make a row of 5 in any direction
