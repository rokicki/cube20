Hi


My name is Nathan, and, obviously, I'm a newcomer to the list.  I have 
need of some help.  

I'm forced to write a paper concerning some famous individual that 
has contributed to mathematics in some way.  After looking carefully, 
I picked Mr. Rubik.  I searched the Net forever, but only came up 
with an interview that was conducted with Rubik.  However, I need 
more information.  Here's where I need you.  

Does anyone have any further information concerning the work of Mr. 
Rubik in any way?  Anything would be of help:  Net sites, books, 
lists, anything.  I'm not in any bug hurry, however I would like the 
information in time to sort it, etc.  

Thank you for your help...


Nathan
