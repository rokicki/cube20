As promised, here is my followup on why the conjugate of x by y is y'xy
rather than yxy'.  Recall that y'xy informally means undo y, then do x,
and finally do y.  It seems strange to undo something before you do it,
but nonetheless y'xy is the conventional definition of congugacy rather
than yxy'. 

My first reference is Singmaster, Notes on Rubik's 'Magic Cube', Fifth
Edition, pp. 57-58. We adopt left to right notation so that (a)xy=y(x(a)).
a is the argument, and x and y are permutations which are composed left to
right. 

I paraphrase slightly, but here is what Singmaster says.  We desire the
conjugate of x by y to be x shifted by y.  By "x shifted by y", we mean
the following.  Suppose in cycle notation we have x=(...,a,b,c...).  Then,
x shifted by y is z, where z=(...,(a)y,(b)y,(c)y,...).  I will defer the
presentation of Singmaster's proof, but the final conclusion is that
z=y'xy.  So our definition of the conjugate of x by y becomes y'xy.  By
contrast, we have yxy'=(...,(a)y',(b)y',(c)y',....), or x shifted by y'. 

While I was chasing down this reference in Singmaster, a message arrived
from Dan Hoey giving an alternative justification for the y'xy definition. 
I will quote Dan's message extensively.  Dan first credits Jim Saxe with
the explanation, and then goes on to say the following.

This is a very old idea in Cube-Lovers.  I believe the first occurrence is
in Symmetry and Local Maxima.  Elements of the standard cube group G were
conjugated by elements of the set M of rotations and reflections of the
cube.  Conjugation of all the elements of G by a fixed element m of M were
viewed as a permutation on G. 

We denote m'gm by g^m for fixed g in G and fixed m in M.  We then denote
{m'gm | m in M} as g^M and {m'gm | g in G} as G^m.  I normally tend to
think of M-conjugation in terms of g^M -- that is, take one fixed element
g and calculate its 48 M-conjugates.  By contrast, G^m means take each g
in G and calculate m'gm using the same fixed m for each g.  It is G^m
which is a permutation on G. 

Dan continues:

Indeed.  It's probably obvious to everybody else how to form the indicated
composition of the two permutations, but I was bumfuzzled for a while. 
Once I figured it out, I just kicked myself for being so dense.  Let me 
explain.

My day job is as a bureaucrat, but most semesters I am also adjunct
faculty teaching elementary algebra and calculus.  As such, I end up
teaching simple funcions -- e.g., f(x) = x^2 + 1. You teach students to
calculate such things as f(2) or f(3).  Then, you teach them such things
as f(a) and try to explain that "x is a variable" but "a is a constant
that you just don't know the value of".  Finally, you get into such 
things as f(a+b) or f(x^2 + 1).  

The latter is the one that really confuses most of my students.  They can
handle "replace x with 2" or "replace x with a".  But they have great
conceptual difficulty with "replace x with x^2 + 1".  The truth is, it is
a bit of a different concept because it is really function composition in
disguise, although most elementary math books don't teach function
composition for several chapters after introducing functions. 

Anyway, with Dan's equation we really just have a function composition
where in the end we replace x with a'xa.  So x->b'xb becomes
a'xa->b'(a'xa)b.  I kick myself because I couldn't quickly figure out the
same concept that I am forever emphasizing with my students. 

Dan continues:

It seems to me that we could rescue the homomorphism and the yxy'
definition, but it would be awkward.  We would have to have the mapping
from g' to its conjugation permutation be the homomorphism, rather than
the mapping from g. 

Now for Singmaster's proof:  given the cycle in our definition of x, we
have x:a->b.  We need y'xy:(a)y->(b)y.  But (a)yy'xy=(a)xy=(b)y.  So y'xy
carries (a)y to (b)y, and we are done. 

Let me finish by talking a little more about the equivalence between
conjugacy and cycle structure.  Again, this is from Singmaster. 

It is the case in Sn that two elements x and z are conjugate if and only
if they have identical cycle structure.  Any finite permutation group may
be viewed as a subgroup of Sn for suitable choice of n.  The theorem may
or may not be true in any particular subgroup of Sn.  The part about
conjugates having identical cycle structure is always true.  But the
converse may or may not be true. 

To say that x and z are conjugate means that there exists some y such that
z=y'xy.  It's easy to see that if x and z have the same cycle structure,
then such a y must exist in Sn (e.g., line up the cycles of x with the
cycles of z, see what goes to what, and that is a y which will work).  The
problem in the general case is that a subgroup of Sn might contain x and z
which have the same cycle structure, without also containing an
appropriate y which would make them conjugate. 

Singmaster shows that the converse of the theorem is true for the
constructable group of the cube, but that it is not true for the standard
cube group G.  The counter-example is as follows.  Let x be a 7-cycle on
the corners and an 11-cycle on the edges -- e.g.,

  x=(C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7)(E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,E8,E9,E10,E11).  

Let z be only slightly different (reversing two corners)  --  e.g., 

  z=(C2,C1,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7),(E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,E8,E9,E10,E11)

The obvious conjugating element is y=(C1,C2), which is in the 
constructable group but which is not in G.  There are other conjugating 
elements, but they are all of the form

(C1,C2) (C2,C1,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7)^i (E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,E8,E9,E10,E11)^i,

which also are in the constructable group but not in G.  Hence, x and z 
have the same cycle structure, but are not conjugate in G.
