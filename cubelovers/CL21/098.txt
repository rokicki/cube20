i was wondering, i bought a rubic's cube about a month ago and my stickers
are already coming off. what can i do  about it? and why don't they use
something different, like plastic color tabs that are superglued on?
please help because i like my cubeand now i'm afraid to use it, it's
dying.

thank you
corie elizabeth
