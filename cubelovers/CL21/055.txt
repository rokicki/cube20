By bandaging a 4x4x4, you can make several variations:  3x3x4, 3x4x4, 2x4x4,
and 2x3x3.  The 4x4x4 is no longer made or sold through ordinary distribution
channels any more, but probably still available from Puzzletts at a high
price.  At the IPP a few months ago someone was offering a real 2x3x3 for
around US$40 I think, which is cheaper than a 4x4x4 is now but still rarer.
