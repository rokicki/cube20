I have no C programs for the cube but MAPLE has a MAPLE-to-C conversion,
but one would have to write their own display.

I don't have a 2x2 program in MAPLE but I'm saving that project for a
student since it is relatively easy, given that I have one for the
3x3 and 4x4 cubes.

This is much more serious than anything I have. My programs are simply
"virtual" cubes with no brains. Sounds like your program gives the
cube a brain! Maybe you could post more details. I don't understand
how it works.                  - David Joyner
