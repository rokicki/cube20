Hi all 
I have a computer program that learn to solve the 2X2X2 cube. I mean that 
after several hours of 'learning' the program knows to solve any legal 
start position of this cube. Before learning the program solve the cube 
after about 15 minuets, after learning it takes about 5 seconds.
The letter from Prof Joyner made me think about the following things:
1. Does anyone have a program (in C) that can take a move (a string or a 
line from a file) and show it on the display.
2. Does anyone know about similar programs to my. Program that 'learn' to 
solve the cube by themselves.
Shai
