 Sorry, don't think I can help with your puzzle, but the Magic
Dodecahedron has (I surely hope!) twelve identical faces; each face is a
pentagon. ("Do" is "two", and "deca" is "ten", loosely speaking; it's a
prefix for "12", unless I'm 'way off base.)  I'm just about sure that each
face has five corner pieces (you shouldn't, strictly speaking, call them
"cubies")  that it shares with its neighbors; also five middle-edge
pieces. It's been years since I saw a photo (In the Meffert catalog of
around 1986). 

Regards,
