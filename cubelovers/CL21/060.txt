 My apologies in advance if this is a repeated topic; it hasn't appeared
recently, at least.

 Question is: What is a really good lubricant for plastic puzzles (such as
the classic Cube) with moving parts? What's good for metal machinery isn't
necessarily good for plastics; there is even a risk that some additives in
metal lubricants would dissolve or etch some plastics.

 A liquid, probably with a benign solvent to distribute it, would be
desirable. Powdered (or colloidal?) PTFE ("Teflon", a Du Pont TM in the
USA) particles or flakes should help a good bit. A "carrier" grease (which
might as well be a lubricant) would keep any particles in place. 
Molybdenum disulfide might be good, but might also tend to stain hands and
clothing. Some waxes might work. Powdered graphite would probably work
loose and make a mess. Lubricants that stain clothing aren't welcome,
either!

 The lubricant must also be benign toward metal, because the Cube is held
together with metal screws and tensioned by springs.

 I suspect that someone, somewhere, knows about a commercial (proprietary) 
formulation that meets most or all of these criteria. (I would not
recommend WD-40, by the way; I expect it would evaporate after some
months. It has its place, but I don't think it's a good plastic
lubricant.) 

 About 10 years ago, I found such a product, and lubricated some of my
puzzles with it, with good success, but then a major personal crisis came,
and I lost track of what it was...

 I'll try to summarize, if any significant number of replies comes by...

 Thanks in advance, and best regards!
