For those interested in three-dimensional graphics of Rubik's Cubes, I =
have made a few nice-looking images and put them at:

	http://www.flnet.com/~ck1

The images are 1024x768 JPEG files.  They were inspired by a ray-traced =
image I found on America Online a couple years ago.  There is also a =
scanned image of cube advertisements from the early 80's.  Enjoy!
