 It's too easy to say, "buy a better Cube." I hope Ideal (if they're still
the official source) wasn't the source for yours.

 You need to know your solvents fairly well, but you might be able to find
a solvent that would not attack the plastic nor the stickers. Once you use
this to clean off all the adhesive, then use a solvent-cure adhesive like
model-airplane glue or Duco to refasten the stickers. Cyanoacrylate (CA,
"Super Glue") should work, but it requires skill to use; it's easy to use
too much; also skill to keep it off your skin. For many CA formulations,
the surfaces must be clean.

 Good luck!

(Can we persuade Ideal to do a run of their deluxe Cubes, that had plastic
tiles and a self-aligning, low-friction mechanism?)
