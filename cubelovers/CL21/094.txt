Subject: Cool Robot Of The Week

Congratulations!  The Chip and Dale robots have been selected as "The Cool
Robot Of The Week" for December 9-15, 1996.

The honor of being listed as "Cool Robot Of The Week" is bestowed upon
those robotics-related web sites which portray highly innovative solutions
to robotics problems, describe unique approaches to implementing robotics
system, or present exciting interfaces for the dissemination of
robotics-related information or promoting robotics technology. This award
carries absolutely no monetary value, official recognition, assumed
support, or tangible benefit, other than swamping your web site with a few
dozen extra hits for a week. But everyone else was putting up their "Cool
Site Of The Millenia" lists, so we figured it was our turn too...

Anyway, to find out more about your listing, see the "Cool Robot Of The
Week" web site at:

Congratulations once again, and we hope that in some small way this "honor"
will bring some more recognition to your work.
