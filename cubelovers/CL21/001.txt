  I have a megaminx borrowed and solve it using some of the 3x3x3
knowledge that I have. It took me two years to solve all cases of
the 4x4x4 (borrowed from the same friend), but not trying so hard...
  I suppose you already have this, but just in case I'll send my own
flip edges formulas in the standard cube to see if they could help
with the other (I guess not):
  R'F'L'U B'U B L F R U'B U'B' (14) (flips F & B edges)
the same formula starting in the 4th move (UB'UBLFRU'BU'B' R'F'L')
flips B & L edges.
  A longer, (but faster in my hands) R B R'L U L'B F'D L'D'UB'U'F B'
(16) (flips L & R)
  R' U2 R2 U R' U' R' U2 L F R F' L' (16) (13 counting ^2 as 1) flips F&R
  
  L'B'U R'U'R B L followed by R B U'L U L'B'R' (16) flips B&R and maybe
works on megaminx...

Hope I'm sending something you don't have.

I'm looking for improving this formulas (all of them exchanges (no
fliping) 2 corners and 2 edges on the top face:
  R2 B' R' U' R U R U'B R B'U B R (15/14) xchg BL-FL corn & F-R edg
  F R'U'R F'L'B U'B'L R'U R / L U F U'F'L' (19) xchg BL-BR corn & R-L edg
  F R'F'R U R U'R2U'R U R B'R'B U (17/16) xchg Bl-FR corn & L-B edg
  L'UR'U L U'R U'L F'L' [F F'] U'L'U L F U (17) xchg BL-FR corn & L-F edg
  R U R'U'R'F R [F' F] R U'R'U'R U R'F' (15/14) xchg RF-RB corn & L-R edg
(I've some more but it's enough, besides I must tranlate them from spanish)

  PS: What a coincidence, my first mail were intended to you, Mark.
