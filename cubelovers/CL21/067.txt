 Thank you! A second vote for silicone. Another respondent, from Finland,
said one shouldn't spray the outside surfaces, but didn't say why. It's
possible that something in the formulation would react with the adhesive
for the stickers and make it become jelly-like; this happened to my "5",
but I have long ago forgotten what I used on it.

My regards to all,
