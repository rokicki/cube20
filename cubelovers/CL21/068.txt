Subject: Dirt?

Hi,

I don't think it's a case of keeping the dirt out as removing it from the cube.
I think the "Dust" is actually parts of the cube that have worn off, and
become entrapped in the cube.

A similar thing happens to roller bearings etc., but with more destructive
results.



Andy Southern.
