An excellent way to re-attach your stickers was taught to me by Mike Green
at Puzzletts.  First clean the blank spot on the cube very well with
rubbing alcohol.  Then put the sticker on piece of two-sided scotch tape,
and trim the tape around the edges of the sticker.  Press it on to the
cube, and presto - it should outlast any of the glued-on stickers.

I tried it, and it worked well.
