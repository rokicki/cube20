Dr. Richard Korf (korf@cs.ucla.edu) included demonstrations of macro learning
on the Rubik's Cube in his dissertation, and in his book on "Learning Macro
Operators."
He may still have his C language code for this available somewhere.

I have used the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 cube in my work on "Pruning Duplicate Operators
in Depth-First Search." Most available format is Proceedings AAAI-93 (Wash. DC),
or from my web page area.

I do not learn to solve the cube, but learn about the cube state space to
speed search.

Neither of our programs produce graphical output.  I may make a Cube page with
a Java applet, unless one of you do it first.
