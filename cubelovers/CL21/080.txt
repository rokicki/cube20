	Actually that is a cubo-octahedron and has as its internal
mechanism a normal cube (with different side and corner pieces).
	This has 10 sides, not 12 like the dodecahedron.  The faces of
a dodecahedron are pentagons and the internal mechanism is actually
quite similar in concept to the cube (12 centers on axes instead of 6
centers on axes).
