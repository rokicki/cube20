If X and Y are sets of permutations, we define XY to be the set
{xy | x in X and y in Y}.  In my various search programs, I have 
encountered a number of cases where we have XY=YX, even though we do not 
in general have xy=yx.  For example, let Q[n] be the set of all positions 
which are n quarter turns from Start.  My standard breadth first search 
is essentially Q[n+1] = Q[n]Q[1] - Q[n-1].  But we could just as well say
Q[n+1] = Q[1]Q[n] - Q[n-1] because Q[n]Q[1] and Q[1]Q[n] are the same set.

I have been wondering, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions 
for XY = YX?  Note that X and Y are not necessarily groups.

I really don't know the answer, and I wondered if anybody out there does. 
I have some suspicions it has something to do with conjugacy.  In all the
cases I have worked with, it it the case that if x in X and y in Y, then
all the K-conjugates of x are also in X and all the K-conjugates of y are
also in Y -- where K is usually M, the set of 48 rotations and reflections
of the cube.  For other searches such as <U,R>, K is the symmetry group
associated with the group being searched. 

It is trivial to make an X and Y that don't "commute" in this matter.  
That is, pick x and y that don't commute and have sets X and Y containing 
only the single elements x and y, respectively.
