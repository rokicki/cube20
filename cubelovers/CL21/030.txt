I think I understand.

There are two cubes, orientated the same, which share a common corner piece.
The shared corner piece has no stickers on it, but is a "Double Inside"
corner piece. The effect is that they share the same line from corner to
corner, passing through the dead centre of the cube. The appearence would be
like a (5x5x5) which had been cut away. 

There would be a cubie at the locations:
(1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,2,1),(1,2,2),(1,2,3),(1,3,1),(1,3,2),(1,3,3),
(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,1,3),(2,2,1),(2,2,2),(2,2,3),(2,3,1),(2,3,2),(2,3,3),
(3,1,1),(3,1,2),(3,1,3),(3,2,1),(3,2,2),(3,2,3),(3,3,1),(3,3,2),(3,3,3),(3,3
,4),(3,3,5),(3,4,3),(3,4,4),(3,4,5),(3,5,3),(3,5,4),(3,5,5),
(4,3,3),(4,3,4),(4,3,5),(4,4,3),(4,4,4),(4,4,5),(4,5,3),(4,5,4),(4,5,5),
(5,3,3),(5,3,4),(5,3,5),(5,4,3),(5,4,4),(5,4,5),(5,5,3),(5,5,4),(5,5,5),

These cubes would *not* rotate about the apparent centre (3,3,3), but about
the two real centres (4,4,4) and (2,2,2).

I could see there being a few perceptual problems. The conecting cubie at
(3,3,3) would have no colour stickers on it, hence position and rotation
must be determined from the other corners. The cube would also appear to the
operator to turn only the outer slice and middle slice of each cube because
the operator would always use the centre of mass as his/her frame of
referance. That is different to the standard (3x3x3) because the operator
feels the outer slices move.

sorry if this is either wrong or nothing new, I just thought I'd share my
thoughts with you.
