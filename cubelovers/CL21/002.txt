Subject: Spanish moves

  Hi! I'm Isidro, (I'm telling so cause I share my mail address)
This is the spanish moving convetion:
  Up = Arriba
  Dwn = Bajo (abajo)
  Lft = Izquierda
  Rgt = Derecha
  Front = Frente (Same letter :)
  Back = Tras (atras)  (This is the one which is confusing, cause the
same letter "B" means differnt things. And I don't have no formulas on
my PC, only some sheets of papers from the '81-'82 and in my head, so
a trnaslating program (very easy to do) it's useless, these last days
I started thinking formulas movements in english, I guess it's the best
choice if we want to exchange things, though I have to recheck everything
to avoid mistakes...
PS: By the way: Which is the preferred convention: U' U3 U- or what?
    Where can I obtain programs for trying to find formulas?
	(I started one myself in Pascal, just interprets moves)
