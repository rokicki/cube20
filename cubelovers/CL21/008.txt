Hi
  I just made a new puzzle for the X Window System and MS Windows 3.1 or
greater.  The new puzzle is Panex which is very similar to (but a lot harder
than) the Tower of Hanoi.  In fact there is a Hanoi mode in the puzzle.
My wife who is usually indifferent towards puzzles, liked this one.

  I also made updates to my other puzzles; the rubik, dino, and skewb puzzles.
You can pick this stuff up at
http://hertz.njit.edu/~bagleyd/

Source code and README files are also supplied.

Cheers,
  /X\   David A. Bagley
