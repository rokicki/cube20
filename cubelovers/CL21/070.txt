Depends on what you mean by a "challenge."  Average puzzlers who found
relatively ordinary algorithms for the 3-cube and 4-cube will discover
that they must find one new algorithm for the 5-cube, but it will be easy.

Even after reading your explanation, I don't quite believe it, but would
love to own one and find out for sure :-)

Consider that the 4-cube (and 5-cube) can be made harder by forcing the
centre (or inner ring) cubies of each face to be oriented.  If this is
done to a 6-cube then of course the 6-cube becomes harder too.  Otherwise
I think my 4-cube algorithms would solve a 6-cube.

>Incidentally, does anyone know if a physical 6-Cube has ever been made?

Someone told Nob Yoshigahara that his country had solved the problem of
manufacturing the thing.  Then Nob was playing with the guy's business
card and lost it, and has never been able to find the guy again.  Although
Nob is known for a sense of humour at times, he sure wasn't joking when he
admitted this.  The only questions are whether the unknown person was
telling the truth, and who and where he is.
