Dear Sir(s)!

I'm a student of graphic design in the University of Industrial Arts in
Helsinki. I'm working on a school project and I need some information on
Rubik's Cube. I'm making a piece that takes advantage of the visual
language of the cube, but I need to know more. I'm familiar with the game
from years back but I never really learned how the actual mechanism worked,
nor anything on the history of the game.

I would appreciate a few hints on the vast amount of home pages on the
subject. What I'm mostly looking for is a basic, no-nonsense explanation
of the history and the philosophy and especially the mechanism  of the
cube (I'd hate to take my only cube apart!). Any illustrations of the
mechanism would be great. Are there any working pictures or plans
available?

Sincerely Yours,
Timo Berry
