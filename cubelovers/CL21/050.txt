Whoops! the flip is done with the right hand keeping the left side of the
puzzle stationary, if that was not already clear.  Doing it with a left hand
twist does a double double switch of edge-wedge and corner-wedge pairs.

Sorry for the errata post on this. Maybe I should add something else to
avoid the complete wast of bandwidth.  

Since he asked... The only thing I know about confirmed maximal moves for
Square 1 is that any possible shape can be put back to two squares with at
most 7 flips, and only one configuration requires that many moves.  That's
the one with a square on one side (CECECECE) and the CEECECCE shape (C=
corner wedge, E=edge-wedge) on the other.  Satisfyingly symmetric antipode.

Corrected permutation of 3 edge wedges:

>T+n = rotate top n/12 of a turn counterclockwise, as seen from top..

>T-n = ..........................clockwise............

>B+n, B-n are the same for the bottom face when looking at it from the
bottom.

>F = flip through center slot. **** with right hand.****

>Try this:

>F T+3 F T-1 B-1 F T-2 B+1 F T-3

>F T+3 F T-1 B-1 F T-2 B+1 F T+3
