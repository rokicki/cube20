I assume this means a permutation of three edge wedges.
I can do it in 8 flips through the center divisor, the most convenient way
I've found to count moves on Square-1.

Start with the permutation on top (in the square/square configuration,
of course).  Position top and bottom squares so that the left side of the
top edge wedge facing you lies above the central turning slot and the
right side of the bottom edge wedge lies below the same slot.  (If you
flip through the center, you still have square configurations, top and
bottom).

T+n = rotate top n/12 of a turn counterclockwise, as seen from top..
T-n = ..........................clockwise............
B+n, B-n are the same for the bottom face when looking at it from the
bottom.
F = flip through center slot.

Try this:
F T+3 F T-1 B-1 F T-2 B+1 F T-3
F T+3 F T-1 B-1 F T-2 B+1 F T+3

Notice that half of this produces two 2-permutations.

I'm curious if anyone speed cubes Square 1.  My average is about 1:35,
with a best time of 1:15 for partial fluke.  I can always do it in under 2
minutes for the worst parity situation.  How does this compare?  There
have got to be faster people out there, because I can only do the regular
Rubik's cube in 55 seconds on average, which is pretty slow by this
group's standards.
