I remember that the 5x5x5 cube I got came with a piece of paper that said 
to cover the face with peeling stickers with a sheet of paper, and apply
a warm iron to the paper.

This re-flattened the stickers, and re-strengthened the glue bond.

This would not be a valid solution if the stickers on your cube are 
sliding off rather than curling up.
