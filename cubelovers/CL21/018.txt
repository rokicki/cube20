Subject: Intro to cube group theory?

Dear mathematical cubologists,
I am creeping on this list since a few months, but I have to admit
that most of the more advanced mathematical technicalities are beyond
my understanding, mainly because I lack knowledge of the basic
facts and terminology about groups.

All I studied about groups was a part of Birkhoff/McLaine's "Algebra"
some 10 years ago. Is there any good reference on groups where I can
educate myself?  I would prefer freeware papers over costly and
hard-to-find (at least in Italy) books. Does anybody have a hint for
me?  The aim of my training is that of learning about M-conjugacy and
the Shamir algorithm, and to be able to follow the technical
discussions about the Rubik cube that appear on this list.

	Riccardo
