 Any self-respecting cube is made of plastic that >should< not be affected
by isopropyl alcohol; but don't use it on an unknown plastic, especially
if you don't want to lose that particular Cube. All except the center
"jack" structure should be cleanable with (hand) dishwashing detergent;
don't soak the pieces.

 Rubbing alcohol has other substances in its formulation that could attack
plastic; better to use 91% or 99% grade from a drugstore; shop around for
price. I have seen 91% isopropyl alcohol at maybe 8 times the price it
should be. Figure maybe $3 US per pint tops. It ignites fairly easily, by
the way! Do be careful. 

 Cleaning will remove all the lubricant, so you'll probably want to
restore it. So far, silicone spray (note that it's not spellled "silicon" 
spray; a chemist knows the difference) seems to be the best. If you have
the Cube apart, consider silicone lubricating grease, also, but it should
not contain other substances that would attack the plastic. (If applying
it to a shiny surface removes the gloss when it's wiped off after sitting
there for a short time, don't use it!). I have heard recommendations for
silicone stopcock grease, which would be a scientific lab. item, as a
joint grease for plastic recorders, but for those you want something that
>won't< allow motion with light forces.

 As to keeping dust out: A lubricant that isn't sticky will help; possibly
finely powdered Teflon, or the white powdered lock lubricant that used to
be (and might still be) on the market. Otherwise, it's a matter of
avoiding a dusty environment!

 In the Navy, we called it Preventive Maintenance, seems to me. (It was a
while ago!) Routine disassembly for cleaning maybe once or twice a year
seems reasonable. Fortunately, the "3" (and bigger ones) come apart
gracefully. The Pocket Cube does not! (It also hates to be reassembled as
well. Wonder whether it's assembled with special jigs and tools, or do the
assemblers simply suffer?)
