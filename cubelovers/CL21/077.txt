 My thanks to the people who replied to my query about Meffert; most said
he's still in business. Thanks also for updates on the Magic Dodecahedron.

 And... BIG apology for tossing in a "High-ASCII" (?) Latin-1 character! 
I only proved my optimism (that it would be OK) and my ignorance (that it
is >not< OK in this List! I'll try to e-mail Alan directly. I would never
have thought that one character would create a mess. Incidentally, and
totally off topic, I found the really-obscure Codepage 819 that makes
MS-DOS totally and directly compatible (no translations to Codepage 850)
with ISO 8859-1, and installed it. Recommended, but e-mail me if you are
interested. 

 Btw, I had problems replying to Norman Diamond; his From: e-mail address
apparently couldn't be found, and my message bounced. Maybe DNS problem?

 [There's just an off-chance that this is double-posted; sorry if so! I
don't think it will be.]

Regards to all,
