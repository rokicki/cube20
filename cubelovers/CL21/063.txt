Yep I know what you mean,
	I'm not really sure if there's anyway to keep the dust out.  I
always thought that the dust helps the cube stay 'smooth'.  
	After I think about it a bit, it seems likely that the dust comes
from plastic moving against plastic and so I'm not sure if the dust can be
avoided. But if you do like it clean you can regularly take a damp cloth
to the unassmbled cube.
