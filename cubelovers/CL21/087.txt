There has been quite a few inquiries as to how this puzzle is a puzzle
and not a hunk of cheese as one reader pointed out.

It turns just like a regular cube.  Apparently it has the same mechanism
inside.  It only LOOKS harder, but after taking a few seconds to analyze
it, I noticed that the solution was the same as the cube.  Still a neat
piece in a collection.
