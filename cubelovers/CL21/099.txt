I have used two solutions.  One is, take the sticker off and then glue
it back on with contact cement; two is, take the stickers off entirely,
clean the glue with rubbing alcohol or some such (careful you don't use
something that dissolves the plastic!), and then paint the cubies.
Pick a paint designed to stick to plastic; model paint probably will
work well, though I used some artist's paints we had around.

Not being someone who has ever made that decision, I don't know...but
my guess is, cost.. :-(
