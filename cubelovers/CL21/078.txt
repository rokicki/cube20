I recently acquired a puzzle through the mail and am not sure what it is
called.  I'll give a shot at describing it:  It has 14 sides - 8
triangles, and 6 squares.  The squares are rotated 45 degrees and each
touch 4 other squares at the corners, while their sides match up with 4
triangles each.  You could achieve the shape of this puzzle by taking a
cube and shaving off the corners to create an equilateral triangle. 
There are no markings or words on it.  If anybody knows, please let me
know, as I am curious if this is the Magic Dodecahedron I've been
reading about.

Thanks,
Scottie
