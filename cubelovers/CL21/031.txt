Siamese Rubik's cubes share an entire column of cubies, i.e. in the
case of two 3x3x3's they share an edge cubie and two corner cubies.

Cubies cannot move from one cube to the other.  The shared column
of cubies cannot be separated or rearranged.  The effect is like
bandaging an edge column on one 3x3x3 cube and bandaging an edge
column on another 3x3x3 cube and having two identical puzzles.

The idea of bandaging has been extended further by Dieter Gebhardt
(publications in CFF) and others.  Most variations of bandaging
cannot be constructed by joining another cube onto it; they just
have to be done in a simpler and straightforward manner :-)
And even when a collector wants duplicates of some version, there's
no need for two duplicates to be stuck to each other :-)  So there
is no real demand for Siamese cubes any more.  But bandaged cubes,
yeah some variations are really really difficult.
