Dear Alan,

In 1994 the Slocum Puzzle Foundation published the Second Edition of the
"Directory of Puzzle Collectors and Sellers". It includes a list of 232 puzzle
collectors and designers and described in detail what puzzles interest them.
More than 120 of them collect, and are interested in, combinatorial Rubik-type
puzzles. It also includes 96 mail order puzzle sellers and 147 retail stores
that sell puzzles (and were recommended by collectors).

I will be sending out letters of inquiry to all collectors & sellers
included in the Directory within the next week for updated information for
a new Third Edition that will be published early in 1997.

Some, but not all, of the Cube Lovers subscribers will receive mailings.

I would be glad to invite Cube Lovers who are puzzle collectors and/or
sellers to email me if they wish to be in the Third Edition and are not in
the current Directory.

I will add a section on puzzle related WWW Internet pages and sites and
expand the coverage of email in the new Directory.  I will send a letter of
inquiry to all that request one and provide their mailing address.  I am
asking for the replies to be returned to me 3 weeks after they are
received.

Let me know if you have any questions or you would like more details.

I would be glad to have this notice posted for Cube Lovers if you think it
is appropriate..

Regards,
Jerry Slocum
