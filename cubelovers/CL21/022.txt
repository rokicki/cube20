    I just bought a new one a few weeks ago at the Kay-bee toy store in
Highland Mall.  They had about 6 cubes last friday when I was there.  They
also have some triamids and a couple snakes left.  No magic or mini-cube's
though. :(

  The Imaginarium in Higland Mall had the Rubik's C4 cube a while back (the
one where you have to align the centers of 4 faces also), but I was quite
surprised to find the store closed when I went to the mall last week. :(

  All the Rubik's stuff goes for $10 a pop.  If you find a better price
somewhere else, let me know.  Also, if you happen to see any stores here 
that have the mini-cube, please let me know!
