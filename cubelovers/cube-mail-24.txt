Subject: Got a new shape...?

On 8/15/97 David Goyra asked for ideas for simulated puzzles.

Obviously there are infinite possibilities.  If you want a source of
inspiration for simulated or real puzzles, I recommend the following
book:

Shapes, Space and Symmetry
by Alan Holden
Dover Publications, Inc.

I got mine at Boarders Bookstores.  It is a book about three dimensional
shapes.  It discusses symmetry and other properties with a minimum of
mathematical terms.  It gives instructions (and pictures) on
constructing many shapes from cardboard or wire.

Any solid shape could be cut (or cuts) parallel to the sides, between
opposite corners, between opposite edges, along edges or any combination
of the foregoing.  You will see the shapes of the common puzzles and
ideas for hundreds more.

Subject: minimal maneuvers for "continuous" isoglyphs

i finished computing minimal maneuvers for the "continuous" isoglyphs.

Subject: Re: Open and Closed Subgroups of G

I'd like to thank Jerry for taking the time to put together his 
message discussing basic group theory as it applies to the cube as
well as the basics of Thistlewaite's algorithm.  Although I consider
myself somewhat beyond the "layman" level in this area, I'm not
always able to follow the various posts to this group.  Besides,
it's also helpful to read a little "refresher" every now and then
to help reinforce and clarify previously digested concepts.

It might also be helpful for someone to cover the basics of cube
parity.  Although I think I understand the basic group theoretic
concepts of permutation parity, the asymmetry of the marked faces
of the cube have never quite left me feeling comfortable about
how this concept is applied to the cube.  Hofstadter, covers this,
but does not discuss it in enough detail for one to fully grasp
the concept.

Subject: Re[2]: Open and Closed Subgroups of G

Oh, and I forgot to mention...

My ultimate goal of understanding parity would be such that someone could
hand me an arbitrary permutation puzzle and I'd be able to examine it and
determine from the set of legal moves both the parity constraints and also
be able to construct a parity test valid from any given puzzle state.

I find it interesting that the method seems to differ across puzzles.
For example, 15 puzzle parity can be determined by the number of pairwise
exchanges required to solve the puzzle, whereas with the cube, it seems
a more direct approach is possible by examining cubie orientations with
respect to marked cubicles.

Still, I'm somewhat mystified.

If I understand parity, Greg's examination would reveal whether someone
had reassembled a Cube (or other mathematically-related puzzle) into a
state that can't be solved.

Greg Schmidt (SCHMIDTG@iccgcc.cle.ab.com) mentions discomfort about 
how concepts of "parity" are applied to the Cube.  I second the
notion! :-)  

I assume that by "parity" we mean that which is conserved as the "twist"
of corner cubies or the "flip" of edge cubies.  I myself have a HELL of a 
time determining a particular corner cubie's precise amount (N/3, N an 
integer) of "twist," or a particular edge cubie's precise amount (N/2, N an
integer) of "flip," other than in the case of an observable change in ONLY
that particular cubie -- and moreover, ONLY in its ORIENTATION.  Any change
in a cubie's POSITION, relative OR absolute, renders my notions of "twist"
and "flip" rather fuzzy.

F'rinstance, start with a Cube in the "solved" state and perform the sequence
(generator?): 

   R' D2 R F D2 F' U2 F D2 F' R' D2 R U2

You will find that "FRU has been twisted -1/3 ("one 'notch' CCW"), and BLU
has been twisted +1/3 ("one 'notch' CW")," relative to their previous
orientations (i.e., relative to "solved") -- and that this is easy to assess
largely because the "solved" state of the rest of the Cube makes it very
clear how the corner cubies' orientations have changed (and their positions
have NOT).  The sequence/generator would produce the same net effect
(twisting FRU -1/3, and BLU +1/3) when performed on the Cube in ANY state; it
would merely be more difficult for the casual observer to identify against
the background of a "scrambled" Cube state.

But, back to the start-from-"solved" example.  If I now make the single turn

   B'

I no longer find it so easy to characterize the corner-twist parity state of
the Cube, because (all of) the corner-cubies affected by this particular
Cube-state-change have left their previous positions, leaving me to wonder,
"RELATIVE TO WHAT" their twist is to be assessed.  How is it done?  What can 
now be said about the "twist state" of, say, the former BLU (now BRU) cubie?
What about the former BLD (now BLU) cubie?

My efforts to "reason it out," within the limitations of my group-theory
background (which is now infinitely broader thanks to Jerry Bryan!), lead to
what almost seems a paradox.  For what it's worth, I present it for your
discussion, and will be very interested to hear what you Cubemeisters are
able to contribute!

Observe that the orientations of all corners in the F layer remain unchanged
by the B' operation last performed.  In particular, the FRU cubie retains its
-1/3 twist relative to (what's left of) the "solved" state.  Assuming that
the "twist" of a cubie which "hasn't moved" REMAINS THE SAME, as opposed to
being, say, "implicitly redefined" by the movement of OTHER cubies, I can
still say a few things -- though not as many things as I would like! -- about
the twist-states of the corner-cubies in the "B layer" after that B' face
turn. 

Invoking twist-parity-conservation (let's just say "twist-conservation,"
okay?), I assert that "the TOTAL twist of all corner cubies in the B layer
must still be 'some integer plus 1/3,'" so as to "cancel out" the -1/3 twist
remaining on FRU.  The B' turn thus imparted "some integer" TOTAL twist,
which is to say, a total of 0 "net" twist, to the corner cubies in the B
layer -- but was it e.g. "0, 0, 0, 0" or "+1/3, +1/3, -1/3, -1/3?"  (I 
believe all other combinations reduce to these.)  Note that this boils down
to asking, "does a face turn, if it twists corner-cubies AT ALL, twist ALL
FOUR the SAME WAY (i.e. apply the same "net twist" to all four), or NOT?"
Is there a definitive answer?  A standard assumption?  Proof or disproof of
either?  It seems there would _have_ to be, in order to have "meaningful"
discussions of "twist" at all.

For a while I thought I could prove that it was the "0, 0, 0, 0" case, but it
turned out that one of my working assumptions was equivalent to STATING that
it was the "0, 0, 0, 0" case.  I was only "proving" my own ASSUMPTION.  Glad
I didn't post THAT. :-)

Naturally, analogous issues and questions will arise when discussing
edge-cubie "flip" and the conservation thereof. :-)

All in all, I'd be VERY interested in seeing the professional theoretical
dissection of this issue!

...

That's all I have today on the subjects of "twist," "flip," and "parity/
conservation thereof."  But before I go, I'll leave you with two more
demented, blue-sky thoughts.  Beware; this is what I get for reading Star
Trek novels before bed, and again at breakfast...

1) At the edge of my intuition, beyond my ability to formalize, I fancy
   I sense that there might be a way of looking at the Cube, perhaps 
   through the use of additional spatial dimensions or their mathemati-
   cal equivalents, in which the Cube is in some sense "always" in the 
   "solved" state, or at least in which it is trivially obvious where lies
   the "direct path" back TO the "solved" state.  I'm visualizing some 
   sort of extra-spatial "rubber bands," or "strings" (in those higher
   spatial dimensions specifically so as to avoid "tangling" issues)
   that "trace" the route (or "net" route) taken by each cubie, or arbi-
   trary collection of cubies, from its/their position(s)-and-orienta-
   tion(s) in the "solved" state, to its/their p(s)-and-o(s) in a "scram-
   bled" Cube.  In such a perception, one could simply "tug on the 
   strings" and "pull" the Cube back to "solved."  Does this make ANY 
   kind of sense to ANYBODY else here?  I feel as though I can "almost
   see it."

2) Is there a notion, has anybody done any work, on Cube states which
   are each other's "duals?"  I define the "dual" of a Cube state X as
   that Cube state reached by performing, on a "solved" Cube, the same
   sequence of turns/moves which "solve" Cube state X.  In other words,
   define a sequence of turns which transforms the Cube from state X
   to "solved," then apply that sequence again to the "solved" cube to 
   arrive at state Y.  State Y is then the "dual" of state X.  Ques-
   tions abound:

      - does each state have EXACTLY ONE dual?  Or many, depending on
        the specific sequence (as we know, there are many) of moves
        performed in solving state X ?  (My gut feeling is that each
        state has exactly one dual.  This would seem to be pretty easy
        to prove using the group-theory math at the disposal of many
        readers here.)

      - are there states which are their OWN duals?  (Yes, clearly; 
        the trivial "checkerboard" pattern arising from a single 180-
        degree turn of each face, is its own dual)

      - a state which is its own dual, is a "two-cycle" with the 
        "solved" state: perform the generating sequence on either and
        get to the other.  Are there "three-cycles?"  "Four-cycles?"
        etc.?

Looking forward to the followups,

I'll take your question as literal, assuming you mean just parity and
not twist and flip, and assuming you know the basic group theoretic
concepts of permutation parity.

Parity of the cube is best described (I think) as applying to whole
cubies rather than to facelets.  As such, a quarter turn of any face is
a 4-cycle on the corner cubies and a 4-cycle on the edge cubies.  A
4-cycle is odd, which is to say that it can be decomposed into an odd
number of 2-cycles.  The "obvious" way to decompose a 4-cycle is into
three 2-cycles.  Although decomposition of a 4-cycle into 2-cycles is
not unique, any such decomposition will contain an odd number of
2-cycles.

Start is even for both the edges and the corners (the identity consists
of zero 2-cycles).  If you any quarter turn from Start, both edges and
corners become odd.  Make another quarter turn, both edges and corners
become even.  Make another quarter turn, both edges and corners become
odd.  Etc.  Edges and corners are either both even or both odd. 

In the constructable group, you can have odd corners with even edges or
vice versa.  For example, remove two edge cubies from a cube and
exchange them without moving any of the other cubies around.  You will
be changing the parity of the edges without changing the parity of the
corners.

The concept of "dual" which you are describing is standard in group
theory (and be extension, in cube theory).  A "dual" is properly called
an inverse.  If you have a sequence of turns which creates a position,
the inverse sequence consists of writing the turns in reverse order, and
converting clockwise turns to counterclockwise turns and vice versa.  So
the inverse of FRU' is UR'F'.  If there are multiple sequences for a
position (and most typically there are), you can do the same thing for
any such sequence. 

Also, a position can be described in terms of which cubies have gone
where.  For example, you might have something like
 
              flu  -->  fur
              fur  -->  frd
              frd  -->  fdl
              fdl  -->  flu

(flu is the front-left-up cubie etc.  Standard Singmaster notation uses
lower case letters for cubies and upper case letters for the moves
themselves.)

You could get the inverse by reversing the arrows like so.

 
              flu  <--  fur
              fur  <--  frd
              frd  <--  fdl
              fdl  <--  flu

More commonly, you would write the inverse by swapping the cubie
designations between the left and right side of the arrows like so.

 
              fur  -->  flu
              frd  -->  fur
              fdl  -->  frd
              flu  -->  fdl


I don't know what you mean by "any work", but here are some standard
information about inverses.  The length of a position X is the same as
the length of its inverse X', where length is the minimum number of
moves to create the position.  If X' is the inverse of X, then X is the
inverse of X'.  The symmetry of an inverse X' is the same as the
symmetry of a position X (see Symmetry and Local Maxima in the archives
for a discussion of symmetry).  A local maximum is a position such that
no matter which move you make, you will be one move closer to Start.  It
is not necessarily the case that the inverse of a local maximum is also 
a local maximum.

Yes, inverses are unique, both for groups in general, and for cubes in
particular.

You have answered your own question.  Many positions are their own
inverse.  Some of them are much more complicated than the one which you
describe.

The proper term for the concept you are describing is order.  If you
repeat a maneuver n times from Start and return to Start, then the
position is of order n.  (Strictly speaking, the order of a position is
the smallest n which will work.  Obviously, if n will work then so too
will 2n, 3n, etc.)  There are many different orders for which there are
cube positions of that order. One of David Singmaster's early Cubic
Circulars (I don't have the reference handy) had a table of possible
cube orders and how many positions there were of each order.

The term cycle is also very important in group theory (and by extension
in cube theory).  Suppose you look at a scrambled cube and determine
that cubie a has gone to cubie b's place, cubie b has gone to cubie c's
place, and cubie c has gone to cubie a's place, then a, b, and c form a
3-cycle.  The way I have defined this particular 3-cycle, you could
write it as (a,b,c), as (b,c,a), or as (c,a,b).  This so-called cycle
notation is circular, so it does't really matter which you write first. 
However, (a,c,b) is a different cycle than (a,b,c).  In fact, (a,c,b) is
the inverse of (a,b,c).  Just for emphasis, (a,b,c) is not like an
ordered pair (or really an ordered triple in this case).  (a,b,c) means
a goes to b, b goes to c, c goes to a.

As an example of a cycle in purely cube terms, the cycle for the example
I gave earlier would be (flu,fur,frd,fdl), so it is a 4-cycle.

At the risk of being repetitious, the answer is, "relative to the home
orientation of the position they find themselves in".  You choose a
special facelet for each corner cubie.  When the cubie is in its home
position, its twist is the position of its special facelet relative to
the home of the special facelet.  When cubie X is in cubie Y's home
position, the twist of cubie X is the position of X's special facelet
relative to the home of Y's special facelet.  The edges are done the
same way, except mod 2.

Cube-lovers can find this in Vanderschel's article (6 Aug 1980) and
the extension by Saxe (3 September 1980).  I mentioned (23 September
1982) that the choice of special facelets is arbitrary, and that a
conservation of twist occurs for a set of pieces of any puzzle that

    1. have an Abelian orientation group, and
    2. are moved in untwisted cycles by the generators.

This is true even if not all the cycles have the same length.  For
instance, we could have a Rubik's cube in which generators move
corners in permutations like (FTR,FRD,FDL,FLT)(BRT,BTL,BLD), and twist
would be preserved.  The key is that for each piece, the minimum power
of the generator that returns that piece to its home position must
also return it to its home orientation.

I'm quite uncertain about what orientation constraints can arise in
puzzles with non-Abelian orientation groups.  For instance, the
hypercorners of a Rubik's tesseract have the symmetry group A4, and
any orientation is achievable up to a constraint imposed by an Abelian
quotient of A4 of type 3 (See 22 Oct 1982).  Does every group have a
unique maximal Abelian quotient?  Is that the only orientation
constraint that can occur?

Subject: Number of maneuvers with n face turns

The number of maneuvers with 1, 2, 3,.. face turns for Rubik's cube are
of course well known and are 18, 243, 3240... But I did not see a closed
formula for these numbers before, so maybe you find the following
formula interesting:

Let r:= sqrt(6), then you have with n face turns

P(n) = [(3+r)*(6+3r)^n + (3-r)*(6-3r)^n]/4

maneuvers.  Because the second part in brackets is much smaller than the
first, asymptotically you have

(3+r)*(6+3r)^n /4 maneuvers.

Even for small n, this approximation is very good. So for n=3 you get
3240.33 instead of 3240. The asymptotic branching factor P(n+1)/P(n) is
therefore (6+3r), which is about 13.348469 .

yes.  let  G  be a group.  it's not difficult to show that

1)  the commutator subgroup  G'  is normal,
2)  the quotient group  G / G'  is abelian, and
3)  if  G --> A  is a homomorphism to any abelian group  A ,
    then  G'  is in the kernel, so there is a unique  homomorphism
    G / G' --> A  such that the original homomorphism is the composite
    G --> G / G' --> A .

this last one is kind of technical, but in the special case where
A = G / N  for some normal subgroup  N , it says that if  G / N  is
abelian, then  N  contains the commutator subgroup.  thus,  G / G'
is the maximal abelian quotient of  G .

the quotient  G / G'  is sometimes written  G^ab  (the "abelianization" of G).
as you might guess, this is an important construction in group theory,
and it's one of the reasons why commutator subgroups are important.

Dan's response (plus his references in the Cube-Lovers archives) pretty
well covers it.  I would just like to add a couple of points.

  1. There is a reference in the archives to a way of demonstrating
     conservation of twist without first establishing a frame of
     reference, but I can't find the reference.  The best I can
     recall, the same technique did not work for edges.  But I prefer
     the frame of reference technique anyway because it is closely
     tied to some of the more usual ways of representing the cube in a
     computer.

  2. For example, number the corner facelets from 1 to 24.  Each
     facelet has two companion facelets which are bound to it on
     the same cubie.  By knowing where one of the three facelets
     of a cubie is in a computer program, you automatically know
     where the other two facelets are, so you only have to store
     one of the three facelets.  The one that you store can be the
     "special" facelet that Dan described for the purposes of
     determining conservation of twist.

     The collection of eight "special" facelets for the corners
     have been described in the archives as constituting a
     supplement for the group, but I have yet to find a discussion
     group supplements in any group theory book.

     As Dan says, your choice of "special" facelet is totally 
     arbitrary for each cubie, but most typically you choose
     the Front and Back facelets, or the Right and Left facelets,
     or something equally well organized.

  3. For another example, number the corner cubies from 1 to 8, and 
     for each of the cubies describe the twist with a number from 0
     to 2.  This is essentially a wreath product representation of
     the cube.  The numbers from 0 to 2 which describe the twist
     can be used to describe whether a cubie is twisted when it is
     not home, and can therefore be used to prove conservation of
     twist.

     Without knowing any more than I do about supplements, it seems
     very likely that it should be easy to represent any group 
     which can be representated as a supplement as a wreath product
     and vice versa.  The isomorphism seems obvious.  I wonder if
     anybody out there can shed any light on this issue?

Let me see what I can do to muddy these waters. 

It seems to me that we might ought to consider the chirality of an
isoglyph as being a different issue than the chirality of a glyph.  I
think the two are clearly related, but I am not sure that the one
necessarily derives from the other. 

As to a glyph, it seems to me that a glyph is chiral only if conjugating
the position by each of the four reflections of the square yields a
different set of positions than does conjugating the position by each of
the four rotations of the square.  Hence, you can have a glyph which
occurs in right-handed or left-handed forms, or one that doesn't.  This
is the simple part. 

I think the situation with isoglyphs is a little more complicated.  For
example, form an isoglyph using both the right-handed and the
left-handed forms of a chiral glyph.  You might have 6 right-handed
glyphs and 0 left-handed glyphs, 5 right-handed glyphs and 1 left-handed
glyph, etc.  If there are unequal numbers of right-handed and
left-handed glyphs, then it seems natural to define the handedness of
the isoglyph as being that of the dominate glyph.  But what if there are
three right-handed glyphs and three left-handed glyphs?

Up to symmetry, there are only two ways to partition the six faces of a
cube into two sets of three faces.  For example, the F, U, and B faces
can be of the same chirality, or the F, U, and R faces can be of the
same chirality (or any conjugates of these choice of faces).  In the
first case, the cube is partitioned like a universal joint, or maybe
like a cubic baseball.  Such a position seems to me to lack chirality. 
In the second case, three faces with the same chirality cluster around a
common corner.  Again, such a position seems to me to lack chirality. 
So an isoglyph which lacks chirality can contain chiral glyphs.

On the other hand, even on an isoglyph consisting of three right-handed
and three left-handed glyphs, you still might be able to find a
distinguishing characteristic of the right hand part that was different
from the left-handed part.  For example, the glyph boundaries which were
internal to the right-handed part of the isoglyph might be continuous
whereas the glyph boundaries which were internal to the left-handed part
of the isoglyph might not be continuous.  Or for another example, the
rotations of the three right-handed faces relative to each other might
be different than the rotations of the left-handed faces relative to
each other. 

(By the way, I have not verified that any of these positions I have
described are actually in G.  I guess I am thinking in terms of the
constructible group of the facelets -- conceptually, peeling all the
facelets off and reattaching them.) 

On the other hand, two glyphs which lack chirality when placed side by
side can be chiral.  For example,

       XOOXXX   (the base glyph is XXX
       XXXOXO                      OXO
       XOOOXO                      OXO )

I really haven't thought through the implications of using six glyphs
instead of two, but it seems to me quite likely that an isoglyph could
be constructed using six glyphs which lack chirality and which are the
same pattern, and where the we could attribute chirality to the isoglyph
as a whole. 

I have thought about this in terms of Herbert's Cube Explorer 1.5
program.  The pattern editor has a check box for continuous.  If you
don't check the box, the program finds both continuous and
non-continuous isoglyphs.  If you do check the box, it finds only
continuous ones.  So I have considered what would happen if the program
had a check box for chiral.  What should it do?  The obvious thing would
be that in normal operation, it would consider conjugates of both
rotations and reflections of the square when building an isoglyph from a
glyph, but that if the chiral box were checked it would consider only
conjugates of rotations of the square.  But is that sufficient to
satisfy our various definitions of chiral, achiral, and/or non-chiral?

for those who are interested in my optimal cube solver, you can now

i've reduced the size of my transformation tables, so now i think there's
a reasonable chance that it will run within 80Mb of RAM.

Subject: idea for smaller optimal solver

a number of people have told me that they don't have 80Mb of RAM on their
computers, so that my optimal solver won't work on their machine.  here's
an idea for an optimal solver that uses much less memory; it should fit
within 16Mb, or 20Mb at the most.  of course, it's a space/time tradeoff,
but perhaps will still be fairly good.

in my current program, i use distances to the subgroup

     H  =  <U, D, F2, R2, B2, L2>

as my "heuristic" function.  there is another subgroup,  H'  , which
contains  H  as a subgroup of index 8.  H'  is the subgroup of all
elements of  H  composed with all (valid) flips of U-D slice edges.

another way to describe  H'  is the subgroup of all elements where
the U face has only the colors U and D, and the same for the D face.
from this latter description, we see that if  H1' , H2'  and  H3'
are the three orientations of this subgroup, then their intersection
is the subgroup of elements that "look like" they're in the square
group.  this is the same target subgroup that my current program has.

the subgroup  H'  also has 16 symmetries.  using this to reduce the
size of the pattern database, and storing each entry with 4 bits,
it should take about 8.5Mb.  my current program also has about 8.5Mb
of transformation tables (but 3Mb of these are not used while searching).
the transformation tables will probably be slightly smaller (certainly
no larger), so it seems plausible that this could run with 16Mb of RAM.

what about running time?  in his paper, rich korf hypothesizes that
the number of nodes generated should be roughly proportional to the
inverse of the size of the pattern databases.  this suggests that
using the smaller tables above would result in about 8 times as many
nodes as my current program.  this isn't bad, especially given that
the branching factor (6 + 3 * sqrt(6) = 13.348469  for face turns,
9.3736596  for quarter turns) is larger than this.  so this approach
would be within 1 turn of my current program.

i don't foresee having enough spare time anytime soon to program this,
so i'll just post it here and maybe someone who is interested will
program this.

Make a single 90-degree inner-slice turn, then solve as before.  This
introduces an odd permutation on the edge pairs, which gets you back
into easily solvable space.  (It's usually easiest if you make sure
that the two swapped edge cubies are part of the slice turn, by placing
on the same slice beforehand if necessary.)

I'm not sure quite what the parity constraint here is.  There is some
kind of even-parity constraint on the edge cubies, it appears, with a
linked constraint on the face centres, but it's not as simple as the
parity of the edge and face permutations being both even or both odd,
because the single slice turn introduces two nonoverlapping 4-cycles on
the face centre cubies - which is, overall, an even permutation on
them.

I do notice, though, that a slice turn produces a 4-cycle on the edges
and two 4-cycles on the face centres; a face turn produces a 4-cycle on
the face centres and two 4-cycles on the edges (and a 4-cycle on the
corners, which may or may not be relevant).  I wonder if there's a
multiple-of-three constraint lurking.

Doubtless some group theorist has long ago worked out exactly what the
constraints are, but I haven't heard.  (I tried to work through a
group-theory text recently, got stalled along about the time it got to
cosets, quotient groups, normal subgroups, etc.)

What's happened here is that you've got those two edge-cubies
_exchanged_.  Here's how it works.  Look at any face.  You will see
eight edge stickers, arranged around the face like eight square
dancers (or Irish set dancers, if you prefer).  Now I hope you are
familiar with one or the other of these kinds of folk-dancing, because
otherwise what I am going to say won't make sense.  Those eight decals
are either men or women, and no matter how they dance around the cube,
they will never change sex.  Every edge-cubie on the 444 has one
permanently male and one permanently female sticker.  If I haven't
clarified things, at least I've spiced them up a bit.

Your problem is one of parity.  You have two edges cubies swapped (this
swap is visible) and two face center (centre) cubies of the same color
swapped (this swap is invisible).  You have to have an even number of
swaps in the total cube.  If you want an even number in the edges (and
you do), then you also have to have an even number in the face centers,
even if swaps in the face centers are invisible.

There is probably a more elegant solution, but the following will work. 
If you encounter the situation you describe, make any middle slice
quarter turn.  This will disturb the centers.  The centers will now have
an even numbers of swaps. Solve the centers again without simply undoing
the middle slice you just made.  The parity of the edges will then be
ok.  (I'm assuming that your solution for the face centers will maintain
their parity after you correct it as described.)

It is possible to solve the problem with a sequence based on a quarter
turn of a central slice, since that, like a swap of two edge pieces,
involves an odd-parity cycle of the edge pieces.  Thus

	r2 U2 r U2 r2

(where r is the turn of the inner slice next to R in the direction
parallel to R)

puts a 4-cycle of edges onto the top face, but leaves you with the task
of restoring the centres.
It was the desire to find something less cumbersome that first lead me
to investigate the archives of this list, and there the answer was:

It does indeed contain an odd number of turns of the central slices to
give the desired parity.

I've had this problem as well. If I understand you correctly, this
problem simply doesn't occur anymore as soon as you number (or mark in
any other way) the center pieces which
a) makes solving the cube a bit more difficult
b) makes sure that you'll always get back to the original
configuration of center pieces.

I've had a similar problem on my 5x5x5 as well, and I assume that
marking the nine center pieces might solve the problem as well.
On my 4x4x4 I also had a problem of having two pairs of edges
exchanged which simply can't happen on a 3x3x3. By experimenting with
3x3x3 moves I found a 24move solution to this, and I wonder if that's
also sort of automatically solved by marking center pieces.

Can anyone confirm this?

That reminds me:
If anyone needs a piece or 2 for the Alexander's Star let me know.
They seem to break pretty easily IMHO.  Please specify colors.
I have a center piece too.

Mine broke a while back and I have since gotten another one.

I find it most convienent to think of this situation as the following:

One of the "center-slices" containing one of the "swapped" edge pieces is
rotated by 90 degrees.

(This is roughly analogous to the the 3X case where the whole cube is
solved except for two corners and two edge pieces being --respectively--
swapped.  The problem is that the unfinished face is 90dg out of phase.)

Rotate that center-slice by 90 degrees and re-solve from there.

This is surely not the most efficient (i.e. shortest) solution; but it is
conceptually straight forward.

This isn't quite true, at least not on the 4x4x4.

While it is true that parity is the question at hand, and also that on
the 4x4x4 cube a quarter of a central slice performs an odd permutation
on the edges which is otherwise "invisible", it is *not* true that
marking the centers will help.  The reason is that a quarter turn on a
center slice of the 4x4x4 performs a cyclic rearrangement of 4 edges -
an odd permutation - while at the same time rearranges *two* sets of 4
central pieces - an even permutation of the centers.  Thus parity does
not prohibit swapping two edges while leaving the centers untouched.

Moreover, in fact there are move sequences which will exchange two
edges without disturbing the position of any other piece, corner or
center - though I don't have any on hand which are short.  If there's
interest, though, I can produce a move sequence to exchange two 4x4x4
edges while leaving all corners and centers in their original
positions.

A cross-section looks like this.  A quarter turn cycles the four E's,
the four C1's, and the four C2's.  This is an odd permutation of the
E's but an even permutation of the C's.  (All the C's are corners, and
can be put into each other's positions with a combination of face and
center turns.)

   E  C1  C2  E

   C2         C1

   C1         C2

   E  C2  C1  E


A full account of parity and possible 4x4x4 moves gives

  4x4x4
  type     ,  how many  ,  parity after:  1/4 face turn , 1/4 center turn
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  corners  |   8                         |  odd           |  even (untouched)
  edges    |   24=2x(12 edges)           |  even (8 move) |  odd
  centers  |   24=4x(6 faces)            |  odd           |  even (8 move)


Thus to solve a 4x4x4 cube you must have made both (1) an even
total number of moves on the faces (to restore the corners and centers to
even parity), as well as (2) an even total number of moves on the center
slices, to restore the edges to even parity.

The parity constraints on the 5x5x5 are a bit different.  In that case
there are two types of edges (the one in the middle of an edge vs the
ones next to the corners) and three types of centers.  Each has its
own parity change under each different slice.  A bit of playing around
shows that any central slice move which cycles 4 edges must also cycle
several kinds of centers.  At least one of those center cycles is odd.
Therefore on the 5x5x5 you cannot exchange a pair of edges without
also exchanging two centers somewhere.  So marking where the centers
go will help on the 5x5x5.

Subject: New cube program available

I've recently finished my implementation of Kociemba's algorithm and it
is now available from the cube-lovers ftp site at:

ftp.ai.mit.edu /pub/cube-lovers/contrib/kcube1_0.zip

The .zip files contains a README.TXT file, commented C++ source, and
an executable program that runs on Win95/NT.  Here's a brief description
of the program that appears in the README file within the "contrib"
directory:

File: kcube1_0.zip
Author: Greg Schmidt <Greg.Schmidt@ab.com>
Description:

    A cube solver that implements Kociemba's algorithm.  This program was
    written for the express purpose of understanding the algorithm in
    sufficient detail for me to implement it.  The source code is included
    and commented with the hope of providing others with a similar
    understanding.


I welcome feedback concerning any aspects of this program.  Many thanks to
Dik Winter and especially Herbert Kociemba for answering some of my
detailed questions as well as allowing me to use their ideas and offer
them to cube-lovers in the form of this program.

Subject: My Revenge is Complete

How strange that I both have a broken Rubik's Revenge and need a piece
to an Alexander's Star.  What are the odds?

I haven't looked at it for quite some time, but I think my Revenge is
complete.  The problem is the ball in the center.  One of the corners
is broken (if you have seen a dissasmbled RR it makes sense for a ball
to have corners) and has resisted all attempts at being glued.  So it
may be that my broken cube will not be of any help to Darin Haines, but
the rest of the cubies are intact if anyone needs any of them.  Which
brings up that I have a fairly large collection of broken or otherwise
incomplete puzzles.  I suspect that this is true for many of us. I would
be more than willing to do some trading if anyone has any particular
needs.  Let me know.

Subject: Re: God's Number

   Don Dailey, Aske Plaat, and myself have a program that will do a
complete 22-ply search in about 24 hours on an 8 processor Sun
machine.  The program measures distance in the QT (quarter-turn)
metric.

I've run some experiments on random cubes, summarized as follows:

112 random odd cubes:
20   depth 19
92   depth 21

57 random even cubes:
41   depth 20
16   depth 22

>From this random sample, it seems as if less than 1% of cubes are
depth 23, let alone more than depth 24.  In fact, the only depth 23
cubes I know of so far are the twelve cubes 1 move away from the
superflip.  This fact gives some evidence that God's number is
probably 24.

By the way, below are solutions and depths for all of the symmetric
cubes enumerated by Hoey and Saxe in their message of Sun, 14 Dec 80.
These are obvious cubes to try because they are local maxima, and they
are all depth 22 or less except for the superflip.  Only one
representative from each of the 26 conjugacy classes is given.  All
solutions were obtained from the program, except for the superflip
solution which is absconded from a post from Reid on Tue, 10 Jan 95.
All depths are exact minimal depths, i.e. no shorter solutions exist.

Message-Id: <19971002000735.AAA23683@home>

I'm tempted to try a little more analysis of the parity constraints on
the 4x4x4 cube, though no doubt it's all been done before.  As der
Mouse said,

A slice turn produces a 4-cycle on the edges and two 4-cycles on the
face centres; a face turn produces a 4-cycle on the face centres and
two 4-cycles on the edges (and a 4-cycle on the corners, which may or
may not be relevant).

I think it is very relevant. We can set the effects out as follows:

Turn		Piece		Cycle(s)	Parity
------          -------         --------        -------

Slice		edge		1x4		odd
		centre		2x4		even

Face		edge		2x4		even
		centre		1x4		odd
		corner		1x4		odd

The consequence is that the parity of the centre pieces depends
entirely on the number of face turns - any slice turns do not affect
the parity of these pieces since the changes they introduce will be of
even parity.  For face turns, the changes to the parity of the corner
pieces and the centre pieces are the same.  Hence if the corner pieces
are in place, the centres will be in an even permutation, and that will
not be changed even if the edge pieces are in an odd permutation, which
was the essence of Clive McCaig's original question. Nor will that be
changed by any turn of a central slice to bring them back to an even
permutation.

I the corners are correct (which I guess is the normal situation when
the problem with the swapped edge pieces shows up) then, though I say
so with some hesitation, I do not think Jerry Bryan is right in saying
that the pair of swapped edge pieces will be matched by a pair of
swapped centre pieces.  For example, the process I quoted switches edge
pieces, and though it has no visible effect on the centre pieces, it
does in fact change the positions of the centre pieces on the front
face (if I have correctly identified the results of a bit of hasty work
with little Post-it stickers).  However, the whole block of four
rotates through 180 degrees, which is two 2-cycles and thus of even
parity.  Edwin Saesen could mark the centre pieces, get them back to
their original position and still find the edge pieces swapped, but
that will not prevent his correcting the edge pieces, and then, if he
wants to, correcting the centre pieces with even-parity processes.

Luckily, for the 4x4x4, we do not have to worry about twists for the
edge pieces or the centre pieces, since that is fixed geometrically for
each position they can occupy.  When an edge piece is in its home
position it must be the right way round.  When it moves to its
next-door position it must flip.  I imagine this is the point behind
Allan Wechsler's charming square-dancing analogy.  The centre pieces
always present the same corner to the central intersection of the face.

	When writing a program to manipulate
the Cube, you're interested in your algorithm.
The output usually looks like RLULRURL

any graphics.

	I will shortly release a freeware

Rubik's Cube. You can incorporate it into
your software and manipulate the cube
directly. See your cube solutions executed in

	For an idea of what this component
will look like, take a Java browser to my

http://www.iol.ie/~goyra/Rubik.html

	The component will be a Java Bean,

As one of the folks who advocated rotating a center slice, let me explain
my (admittedly non-optimal) process for getting out of this fix and perhaps
you can explain where my reasoning is wrong.

1] Imagine a 4X which is completely solved except for two flipped (i.e.
swapped) edge-pieces.

2] For simplicity's sake --and without loss of generality--, assume the 2
flipped/swapped pieces are adjacent and in the top front location.  So the
top of the cube will look like this:

   X X X X
   X X X X
   X X X X
   X 1 2 X

(Here the numbers are meant to indicate only where the cubies are located,
having nothing to do with their colors.)

3] I now rotate one of the center slices (say, the one on the right, i.e.
the one containing the cubie "2") 90dg away from me.

4] The top of the cube now looks like:

   X X 2 X
   X X O X
   X X O X
   X 1 3 X

5] I can now perform the 3-cycle 1->3->2 (i.e. without affecting any of the
rest of the cube).

The top of the cube now looks like:

   X X 3 X
   X X O X
   X X O X
   X 2 1 X

6] In particular, note that "2" and "1" are now in their correct positions
(and, of course, necessarily in their proper "flip" orientation).

7] Moreover, note that I now have exactly three edge cubes in the wrong
place (i.e. "3" from above and the other two edge cubes which were
misplaced during my original 90dg rotation of the center slice).

I can now perform a 3-cycle on these edges pieces (similar to the one used
in step 5 above) again without affecting any of the other locations on the
cube.

8] My cube now has all the edge pieces in their correct location.

9] I now have only to "fix" the 8 central-face cubes which were misplaced
during my initial 90dg twist.  I can now do this is short order.

I absolutely agree with your reasoning. A quarter turn of a central
slice must be at the heart of any procedure to perform an edge swap,
because it is the only way to change the parity of the edges.  That was
what I said in my first post on 1 October 1997.

In my second post I was trying to look at the effect of that quarter
turn of the central slice on the centre pieces, and show that, as they
had been subjected to an even permutation by reason of the centre-slice
turn, the centre pieces could not have undergone an invisible swap of a
single pair of centre pieces.  Having made a single quarter turn of the
central slice, all the other edge and centre pieces can be restored
with processes of even parity, like your two 3-cycles.

I guess my terminology was incorrect.  The parts I need are actually the
center cubies of which there are 4 on each side (for a total of 24).  It
sounds like Joe McGarity's broken RR will help me out just fine (as will
a couple of other responses I've received).

I got to looking last night and found that I actually need 3 (not just
1) of these center cubies.

How stable are the 4x4x4 and 5x5x5?  I was thinking on getting one but they
cost quite a lot of money and was wondering how easy it is to break them.
Also what kind of paint should I use to paint my cubes as I have 4 normal
ones and would like to make different patterns on them to make them more
intersting.  Also any patterns would be helpful.

They do break easily. I haven't had mine out of storage for some time, but
I well remember that it needed conscious care when manipulating; nothing
like a properly-lubricated deluxe Ideal 3^3 (the one with plastic color
tiles, and changes to the shapes of the pieces that tend to make it
self-align).

Wow.  I am impressed with how much data you have.  For the case of
random cubes and guaranteed optimal solutions, I believe this is the
most data which has been posted to Cube-Lovers.

It would be nice to examine enough cases to raise the probability that a
few positions of length 17q would show up for odd cubes and of length
18q for even cubes.  At this distance from Start, the branching factor
for one level is about 9.3, so the branching factor for two levels
(e.g., between level 17 and level 19) would be about 85 or so.  So you
are just at the edge of the sample size where you would expect the
shorter lengths to show up.

Notwithstanding that, I decided to play with the numbers to see if I
could make any reasonable projection about the overall distribution of
lengths in the quarter-turn metric.  Here is what I have come up with.

Consider the 19q case.  Your results suggest that about 17.8% of odd
positions, and hence about 8.6% or 8.7% of all positions are exactly 19q
from Start.  (The sample size does not support an estimate of that
precision, of course, but let's continue anyway).  It's easy to
calculate that no more than about 8.4% of positions can be 19q from
Start.  From this, I would conclude two things.  First, your results
seem right on, well within the bounds of sampling error. Second, your
results suggest that it is very unlikely that the branching factor drops
below about 9.3 until you pass 19q from Start.  Using the best available
known results, plus using your results as an estimate, plus some other
guessing, I would propose that the actual search tree for the q-turn
case looks something like the following.

Distance Number   Branching    Cumulative
 from     of        Factor      Number of
 Start   Positions              Positions


   0            1                       1

  23           12    0.000      4.210E+19
  24            1    0.083      4.210E+19

Notice that my table does not quite reach |G|, so there are probably a
few more positions than this at 20q, 21q, and 22q from Start (there
can't be more any closer to Start than that). Also, the branching factor
probably does not remain constant at 9.333 all the way out to 19q from
Start; it probably declines slightly, maybe to 9.300 or so.  Finally,
the distribution is probably bimodal, with modes at 20q and 21q (it
almost has to be bimodal because of odd/even parity considerations).

(By the way, I am making no claim whatsover that the diameter of the
cube group is 24q.  This is only an educated guess based on the evidence
at hand.  In fact I tend to doubt it.  I think the branching factor in
the chart just drops off too sharply at levels 21q, 22q, and 23q for
the chart to be real.)

wow, that's quite a bit faster than my optimal solver!  how about searches
through other depths (20q, 21q, 23q, ... )?  does the run time depend upon
the input position?  could you describe your searching algorithm?  i'm
sure that this would be of interest to many people on the cube-lovers
mailing list.

i already posted data for these positions, but it's always nice to have
confirmation.  however, ...

this is solvable in 18q:

although i gave it in a different orientation.

there's a slight typo here; the last twist should be  L' .

5Xs are pretty stable; each side has a fixed center piece (i.e. like a 3X).
I've had three and never had any problem with any of them.

4Xs are another ballgame altogether.  Since they don't have a fixed center,
they depend on an internal configuration, consisting of a cluster of four
plates, to hold the faces on.

Each of these plates is held on with a screw and this adjustment is
_critical_.  Too  tight and it can be all but impossible to twist the
faces; too loose and the cube tends to dissolve in your hands.

I've owned four; one was fine, one was OK/usable, one was too stiff to use
and one couldn't be kept together.  So, the "usability" rate was approx
1/3.  (OTOH I picked them all up for $2/ea at a ToysRU clearance...)

Not too long ago, I reported that my Shamir program had completed
searching through 11q from Start, that the results did confirm my
previous results using tape spinning programs, that no local maxima were
found 11q from Start, and that otherwise nothing new was found.  I have
come to realize that there is a small bit of new information.  I really
should post the maximality analysis in its entirety, because the whole
row 11q from Start is new.  The row 11q from Start does include the
failure to find any new local maxima.  As always, the local maxima are
in the right-most column, where all 12 moves go closer to Start.

Hello,
  I wonder if someone can suggest a way to fix my 3x3x3 cube.  The screw
  that holds a center cubie to the spindle has stripped out of the spindle.
  I thought of just super-glueing it back in; would this work?  Also, I
  wonder if there is to be any tension (compression) on the spring inside
  the center cubie when the screw is set in?  I'm afraid that I will have to
  open up the center cubie and use a driver to screw the cube together
  again.  I don't want to pry open my center cubie.
  Thanks for any suggestions.

Was there ever any more information on this?

The lower bound for the diameter of the cube group was raised to 24q on
19 February 1995.  I would be very surprised if Keith Randall presented
a position requiring 24f.  I don't know of any published results in
metrics which include both slice and face turns.

This is a response to a pretty old message:

However, I kept the message around, which usually means I never did
anything with it.  If I already did, my apologies to the list for
duplication.

I wish to speak to the last sentence of the Class 4 description.  Back
in my larval stage (mid-'80s), someone at a lab I worked for build a
Class 4 program in Franz Lisp.  It wasn't fast, but that was probably
because it had nothing more than a VAX-11/780 to run on.  (I remember
it particularly as it was one of the most impressive pieces of hot-spot
optimization I ever did; replacing about 20 lines of Lisp with about 20
lines of assembly got a speedup of between two and three orders of
magnitude overall.)

I have no idea whether the program still exists in any form.  I do
believe I can still reach its author, if anyone would like me to
inquire.

I've owned only one 5-Cube and have had no mechanical problem with it
at all.  I bought it in mid-December 1993, but unfortunately I don't
know where it came from.  I probably got it at a retail toy/game store
here in the city called Valet de Coeur ("Jack of Hearts" in French),
but (a) am not sure of even that by now (though I have trouble
imagining where else might have had it) and (b) I have no idea where it
was made or what distributor they got it from.

I sure have, with my 5-Cube.  Three of the 25 have come off, and one
has been completely lost (the other two are attached to the cube with a
piece of masking tape, pending my doing something more permanent).  I
may do to it what I did to one of my 3-Cubes recently: take all the
stickers off and use plastic-model paint to color the cubies.  (I
actually may do this to just the orange face, since that's the only
problematic one.)

There has been a new run (I'm not sure if it's by Ideal or not), and I
saw two on the shelf under the Lego Brand Construction Blocks (tm) (Note

In retrospect, Class 4 programs are not necessarily more sophisticated
than Class 3 programs especially when one considers that the latter
should be be able to produce a macro-table solution by solving for
a sufficient set of specific sequences.  Perhaps, I'm overly fascinated
by a learning program which, in essence, outputs a solving program but
I don't want to discount the fact that there are some very interesting
and sophisticated Class 3 programs out there.

Richard Korf points out a suggestion by Jon Bently that the learning
program can be be interleaved with the solving program, as co-routines,
and only running the learning program when a new macro is needed to
solve a particular problem instance.  Thus, the specific entries

It would be interesting to compare the approach of this program to
Korf's learning program.  If the program is still available I suggest
it would make a quite excellent addition to the cube lovers archive.

This means that the solving program has to imagine macros, try to
choose a useful one, determine whether it's actually possible (you
gotta keep the program from trying to produce, for example, a single
edge flipper).  You also have to decide when it's worth trying for a
macro and when it's better to just hit the (sub)problem with brute
force.  I would expect all these problems to be quite hard.

 I think these might be made of plastic instead of paper, and they seem to
have a different adhesive. I thought mine were loose because I had tried
several lubricants on my cube, and the lube. had interacted with the
adhesive; apparently not. Someone who's smart with solvents might be able
to remove all the adhesive, and reattach them with a better adhesive.
CA ("Krazy Glue"; cyanoacrylate) might be good, as might plastic-model
cement. However, one should be careful; a 5^3 is not something to
mistreat!

The new ones, at least the ones that I've gotten in the last year or less,
are made by Oddz-on (sp?).  I think that they still make them but I haven't
looked in a few months.  I called them a few months ago to see if they had
plans to make a 4x4x4 but they said no.  Also they did make 2x2x2's for
awhile but I don't think they do anymore, plus the 2's were hard to rotate
and fell apart eaisly.

 Can you comment how good the new cubes from Oddz-on rotate?  Are they
 smooth and slick like the original Rubik's Cubes were or hard to turn like
 the knock-offs were?

Although I haven't verified this with Richard Korf, I think there
is a very simple approach to this.  Consider each cubie to have one
of two states, either "fixed" or "don't care".  Initially, all cubies
are in the "don't care" state.  If a cubie state is "don't care" then
that means we disregard it's position (i.e. location and orientation)
in the target state for a particular macro.

Number all 20 of the corner and edge cubies.  Now perform the following
"Pidgin C" algorithm:

Mark all cubies[1 through 20] as "don't care" in current_cube_state

for (i = 1 to 20)
{
  target_state = cubies 1 through i in proper home cubicle position
    and marked as "fixed", all other cubies are in a "don't care" state

  Construct a unique macro index =
    f(IN = current_cubie_position[i], IN = desired_cubie_position[i])

  if (the macro at "index" doesn't exist)
  {
    Class_3_Solve(IN = current_cube_state, IN = target_cube_state, OUT = macro)
      add the new "macro" to the macro table at "index"
  }

  Apply the macro to our current_cube_state

  Mark cubie[i] as "fixed" in current_cube_state
}

Note: Class_3_solve must be able to accept an initial and goal state
augmented with the "fixed" and "don't care" markings and should honor
the constraints implied by them.  To put it another way, if a cubicle
is marked as "don't care" then a valid target state allows this
cubie to be placed in any other cubicle not currently occupied by a
"fixed" cubie.  Not really a big deal for any search procedure as we
are simply relaxing the goal state condition to a partial match rather
than requiring an exact match.

So we start out by solving for one cubie only and ignore the effect
this has on the remaining 19 cubies.  We continue doing this, each
time successively fixing another cubie and ignoring the rest, until
all cubies are finally in place.  For any valid cube configuration,
we are always guaranteed to find a macro that can solve this subproblem.
Actually, we will never fully iterate to all 20 cubies since it
is impossible to move just a single cubie.  For example, the very last
subproblem for cubie #19 might be an edge flip.  Once we've discovered
and applied the appropriate macro for this particular edge flip
we will have also flipped the #20 cubie and placed the cube in its
solved configuration.

Initially, the macros are very easy to find since most cubies
can be relocated.  At the very end, we can only move very few
cubies, and the macros are more difficult.  But a class 3 program
can solve any cube and thus can find even the most difficult
macros (e.g. an edge flip).

Eventually, once we've solved enough cube instances, our macro table
will be complete and all future cubes can be solved via macro table
lookup without the aid of the solving portion of the program.

Regards,

-- Greg

This got sent to me and I think that it was for the list so I'm forwarding
it.  On the same note I have three of these cubes and they work well but the
stickers become old fast.  They begin to come off around the edges and the
protective cover sometimes comes off.

Is there a short way to flip a middle edge cubie without disturbing the
top layer or the other middle edges?  I mean, better than replacing it
with one from the bottom and then putting it back in the correct
orientation, which takes 15 moves.

Subject: Availablility of Rubik's Cube

I've followed the thread about the availibility of Rubik's Cubes.
 
Ideal Toy is once again manufacturing Rubik's Cube for the mass market. 
New packaging (with the correct number of permutations) has been 
purchased by myself in a Canadian Toys R Us store just recently.

I know nothing of the Oddz-On cubes, but the new Ideal Toy cubes are
wonderful. The new cubes sport a new logo and brighter colours, but
they use the same colour arrangement as the Ideal Cubes of old.

There is also an official site for Rubik's Cube at http://www.rubiks.com
Unfortunately they are not answering their mail and are attracting a
mostly younger crowd. They are also using Karl Hornell's rubik's cube
java applet (sporting the incorrect colour arrangement I might add) 
without giving any mention of Karl's name. It is an exact byte for 
byte copy. Although Karl does give out the Rubik's Cube java applet
as freeware, I think he deserves credit from the Ideal web site.

As for my own web site (which does sport Karl's java applet with the
correct standard colouration, and also BEFUDDLER support!) I intend
to record the entire chronology of all the cube contests from every
country, including all the records from the World Championships.

My Rubik's Cube web page is currently http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman

If anyone has any information about the cube contests I have missed,
please email me. Thanks!

i've noticed that here in northern ireland, there are a couple of
places selling cubes.  one is a standard copy of the rubik's cube,
and the other is called "magic cube" which has holographic stickers
on it, and the cubies are much squarer making it very difficult to
take apart.. it comes with a locking key which allows you to remove
one of the faces..  the turning mechanism is _really_ loose, too
loose in fact, but mine hasnt fallen apart.   

as an aside, i have an original cube, that my grandmother bought me
16 or 17 years ago, and it's still got all it's original stickers!

 Take a look at http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif/Mike/middle.html.  I
think this is the sequence you want:

2) R2 D2 F' R2 F D2 R D' R

This sequence flips the cubie on the front-right edge without disturbing
the upper face or the other middle edges.

18 q turns 16 h turns. Guess it wasn't any better but you may notice
that this sequence also leaves the bottom intact except for one flipped
cubie at  the back down edge.

Subject: A 4 Dimensional Rubik's Cube

About 18 months ago I sent this group an email about a Mac based program I
have written that simulates a 4 dimensional (3x3x3x3) Rubik's Cube based on
an unpublished paper by Harry Kamack and Tom Keene.

Some of you who were interested in the paper that describes the model and
the program had difficulty with the copies I sent you and, I suspect, were
unable to read it after you received it. Someone suggested that I translate
the document into HTML and this email is to let you know that I have done
that and will send either a ZIP or STUFFIT archive of the document to
anyone interested.

I know that maybe I should get a web site and put the paper there but I'm
not up for designing a web page or maintaining it. If you would like a copy
of the document and would also like to put it on your web site, let me know
that too.

The HTML version of the document consists of 36 fairly small GIFs that
illustrate the words. The STUFFIT archive is 328K and the ZIP file is 320K.
The documentation for the Mac based ZIP program claims that the file can be
successfully unZIPped on non-Mac platforms. The STUFFIT archive is
self-extracting if you're Mac enabled.

Send me an email if you are interested in either the program or the HTML
document or both. If you just want the document, tell me which format you
want. If you ask for the program I will assume you have a Mac and will send
everything in a STUFFIT sea.

Regards to all...

Subject: Megaminx, the 10-spot and GAP

First of all, the STANDARD colour arrangement used by Ideal Toy is as
follows:

UP      = White
DOWN    = Blue
FRONT   = Yellow
BACK    = Green
LEFT    = Red
RIGHT   = Orange

All the official Ideal Toy 2x2x2, 3x3x3 & 4x4x4 cubes used this
arrangement.
Even my 5x5x5 cube is the same.


Secondly, I have at last resolved the 10-spot pattern for the megaminx
in GAP. I created the process m1a which is the sequence of operators
to generate the 10-spot. I had no C_U operator, so it was more
difficult than I thought it would be.

To see all the gory details surf to the following URLs
(These are all GAP text files)

http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/dodeca.txt   describes the megaminx
http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/megaop.txt   describes operators
http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/spot.txt     generates the 10-spot

Note that after executing spot.txt (which loads the other necessary
files) in gives the order of process m1a correctly as 5.

This generator uses all of the megaminx operators except the top and
bottom faces, so it is a pretty good test of the correctness of the
all of dodeca.txt, megaop.txt, and spot.txt

I believe this is the first simulation of the megaminx generating
the 10-spot although Dr. David Joyner is very close! His work is
more graphically interesting (using Maple to generate 3d pics
of the megaminx) but his operators to rotate the whole megaminx
are cooked. However, we have both verified that processes
m2, m3 and m3a are correct and have been graphed correctly using
Maple.

I remember having one if the early Ideal cubes (at least I think it
was), and green was opposite blue.

Recently I bought one of those "odds-on" cubes, and within a week I
wore the plastic coating off the faces, so I decided to peel all the
stickers off and paint it using model paint.  I decided to keep the
most similar colors opposite each other (blue-green, red-orange,
yellow-white).  I find this arrangement makes things easier when
cubing under dim lighting. :)

In front of me I hold a cube from one of the first batches from Hungary
with the following colour arrangement:

Up = white
Down = yellow
Front = blue
Back = green
Left = red
Right = orange

Does anybody know the history why this colour arrangement was changed?

BTW: Even if Ideal Toys has their own local standard, it doesn't change
the original ("correct") colour arrangement.

Most of the early "clone" cubes had the Blue/Green arrangement instead of
the Blue/White.  Most Ideal cubes seemed to have the Blue/White.  There were
exceptions, though...

I remember there were several factories where Ideal had their cubes made.
Some factories were better than others in terms of their quality.  My
favorites were the ones that said "Made in Korea" on a little peel-off gold
sticker.  Back in those days I would refer to "my Korean cube."  Believe it
or not, these all had the Blue/Green arrangement but they were genuine Ideal
cubes!  Their cubes were also the smoothest.  I still have one of them that
is in near perfect condition.  It was the cube I used in the competitions.

The other factories included Japan and Hong Kong.  The Japanese cubes seemed
more prevalent and I still have at least three of those-- all featuring the
Blue/White arrangement.

The earliest Rubik's Cube I ever saw had strange colors-- grey instead of
white and the shades of green and blue were very different from later cubes.
I don't think it was an Ideal cube.

The Blue/White arrangement definitely won out as Ideal's "standard"
arrangement since their 4x4x4 Revenge and 2x2x2 Pocket Cubes featured the
identical coloring.  Some Ideal 3x3x3 cubes were Blue/White but
"non-standard" because the Yellow/Green would be reversed (mirror image).
Who knows why these variations existed-- probably something as simple as
some factory tech switching the sticker feeds accidentally?

The new "Rubik's Cubes" made by Oddz-On are not all that great, in my
opinion.  They look shiny and great in the box, but after mild use the
stickers get ruined.  The Square-1 puzzles suffer the same fate.  Also their
turning mechanism is nowhere near the quality of the "Korean cubes."  Their
2x2x2 "Mini-Cube" as it is now called also lacks in quality compared to the
old Ideal Pocket Cubes.  Still, it warms my heart to see them back in toy
stores again!

Much better are the "Magic Cube" clones that appeared last year.  I have
purchased several of these (only $3.99 at Walgreen's!) and they turn very
smoothly.  The holographic stickers are different, but they don't wear out
like the Oddz-On cubes.  Also, mine feature the Blue/White arrangement!

I recently saw a post that Ideal is now making cubes again.  This seems
strange since I thought they went out of business, but I could be wrong.
Anybody know the real scoop?

Finally, Square-1 seems to have made a reappearance.  I thought they only
made one batch of these, but maybe they've made another lately?

I have serveral cubes spanning over a decade and a half in front of me.
Here's the quick color arrangements:

Rubik's Cube (circa 1982)
Up = White
Down = Yellow
Front = Blue
Back = Green
Left = Orange
Right = Red

I've owned this cube for what feels like forever.  I'm not even sure how I
even found it again, because I dug it out of some old junk after not having
a puzzle for about 5 years.  This is slightly different from the one you
described as being from Hungary.  I suspect mine is from there too, so
maybe production values weren't as high as they could be.

Rubik's Cube "4th Dimension" (Golden Toys, circa 1988) - Poor quality in my
opinion, as the stickers are paper with a clear plastic laminate, but
despite only being taken out of the box only 4 Times ever, the plastic
laminate is already peeling in spots.
Rubik's Mini Cube (OddzOn, circa 1996)
Rubik's Cube (OddzOn, circa 1997)

All of the above have the same color arrangement as what you described
below as being the "Ideal" solution, which I believe isn't the best.  I
still think that the opposite pairing of red/orange, white/yellow, and
blue/green makes for the best balanced color combination.  Not to mention
it's also the best quality with plastic stickers instead of paper.

Subject: RE: Colour arrangements (Was: Re: Megaminx, the 10-spot and GAP)

	The colour arrangement on the early Hungarian cubes was quite random!!
I even have two examples where two faces have the same colour!!  It was not
until about 1980 that the idea of having a standardised colour pattern was
adopted and the most common was to have the opposite faces differ by yellow.
That is the opposite faces were  White - Yellow,  Blue - Green,  Red - Orange.
Rubik went to some effort to select six colours that would be maximally
distinct, but I think the yellow, red and orange tended to be too close in the
sense that either the orange was too close to the red or too close to the
yellow! 
	However, this does not completely determine the colour pattern.  Just
as with a die, there are two possible arrangements.  Conway and Guy etc.
observed that Blue, Orange and Yellow meet at a corner and they can occur
clockwise or counterclockwise, spelling  BOY  or  YOB.  Some people have
expressly asked me for one form rather than the other!
	An early anecdote, from about 1979.  A friend's son was trying to help
another friend solve his cube over the telephone.  This is a pretty formidable
task at the best of times, but their two cubes had different colour patterns,
so the son was making statements like: turn the red face, that's blue on your
cube, ....

  Is the orientation of the above fixed in some way or is it arbitrary ?


  My second cube (can't remember what happened to the first one) is a later
  edition (not sure if it is Ideal) with the same arrangement to above
  except, the orientation is different (UP is either RED or ORANGE) The
  reason I say this is that the LEFT,RIGHT,DOWN and FRONT faces have
  symbols printed in the centre as follows :


  YELLOW - signature of Erno Rubik
  WHITE - Rubik's CUBE tm
  GREEN - C*4**4 (actually uses superscript 4 for the power)
  BLUE - silhouette (of Erno Rubik)


  The symbols are designed to make the cube harder to solve - the challenge
  is to solve the cube with the centre cubes all in the correct
  orientation. I recall that there are sequences of moves that rotate pairs
  of centre cubes.


  This cube is definitely a lot stiffer than my original cube but the
  novelty of speed cubing has worn off anyway.

I am attempting to design a 6x6x6 cube.  My idea to make it structurally

a ball in the center.  Then all other pieces are wedged behind those.  I
think that extending from the 5x5x5 design the same way the 4x4x4 was
extended from the 3x3x3 design would be way too flimsy, mainly because
the centers would have to be attached via long, thin struts which are
apt to break easily unless made out of metal, which would make the thing
way too heavy.  The width of the cubies probably could not be more than
14 or 15 mm; if they were larger, the cube would be quite big and so it
would be difficult to manipulate.

Unfortunately the ball would be quite complicated, with six or even nine
tracks in it instead of just three as in the 4x4x4 cube.  It might have
to be made of metal instead of plastic (it shouldn't be too heavy if it
is hollow).  Also the 152 pieces will be a real pain to put together...

Of course, even if it can be built, does anyone know how to solve it?

Here is a rather crude diagram of a cross section through the center of
the cube.  Actually it is just a quarter of a cube.

Ok folks, one last bit of info about the cube colour controversy

The colouring "standard" I was referring to was used by Canadian and
the USA cube contests. Having said that there were probably contests
where people brought there own cubes, and that would make it potpourri.

Moreover, this was stipulated in the rules of the contest. I still have
the form. The only difference between differ by yellow and the standard
Ideal cube was the transposition of yellow and blue.

There isn't really a standard orientation, save for the orientation 
I use in my own cube programs. All the Ideal cubes I have conform
to White/Blue, Yellow/Green, Red/Orange for Top/Down, Front/BACK,
Left/Right.

So I suppose it is open to interpretation. I thought David Singmaster 
might mention what colour arrangement was used in the World Championship.

So a case may be made for both "Differ by Yellow" and Ideal Contest
Colours.

Would someone like to pick one?? :-)

If it can be built and scrambled, it can be solved.  In fact, it could
make for a very interesting puzzle since it could behave identically
to a 3x3x3 if one wanted it to, just like a 4x4x4 can be manipulated
like a 2x2x2.  Heck, the 6x6x6 could also behave like a 2x2x2...  One
puzzle could take the place of two others.  Sort of a "mix and match"
difficulty setting.  Regardless, I suspect that many would applaud the
ingenuity of a 6x6x6 if it was executed elegantly and worked well,
like the 5x5x5.

The moderator of the mailing list stated that a 7x7x7 cube could be
built, but I counter that it would require "cubes" of dissimilar size
or some kind of groove type scheme, which actually isn't quite in the
spirit of a cube.  Even a 6x6x6 would require some careful engineering
since the corner cubes just barely overlap.

> Also what is the mechanism for a 2x2x2 cube?  Could it be extended to

The mechanism of the 2x2x2 is similar to the 4x4x4, which makes both
of them rather stiff.

I'm sure supersets of many existing puzzles have been considered.  I
myself spent some hours contemplating and drafting the possibility of
a pyraminx to the next level.  I called it Tut's Curse as a sort of
'project' name, despite the fact that Tut was never buried in a
pyramid.  Maybe that's why I never completed the project.  Oh well.

Subject: RE: 6x6x6 cube design

	First, regarding the 6^3 and 7^3.  As noted, when you get to
these sizes, the connection of the corners while turning becomes
problematic.  For the 6^3, the overlap is about 15% of the edge length
of the cubie, probably too small to be practicable.  One can imagine
some clever mechanism to hold onto the corners, but it would be tricky
and I've never seen one clearly described.
	However, if you think about it, there's no reason for all the
levels of the cube to be the same size.  That it, the parallel cutting
planes of the entire cube do not have to be equally spaced.  One can
thus have the corner cubies be very large with much smaller centre
cubies.  The edge cubies will be cuboids, rather than cubes.  Using
this idea, one can make arbitrarily large cubes, but the interior
pieces become impossible to manipulate.

	Now let me try my hand at describing three versions of the 2^3.
	I'll start with the simplest which was sent to me from Japan
about 1980.  This had a steel sphere in the middle and each cubie had
a magnet in it.  Although the sphere and the cubies were carefully
machined, when one moved it quickly, a piece would catch against
another piece and lift off and then fall off.  Not very successful.
	The second version was patented by Ishige in Japan about 1977?
and several versions were made.  I received a batch of seven with
different colouring patterns made by a German sports firm - three or
four had broken just in the post!  This version has a central sphere
and six of what I call 'umbrellas' sticking out toward each face
centre.  Each of the pieces has a notch around the part that rest
against the inner sphere.  The umbrellas catch into these notches.
One can also think of the cubies as having their own umbrellas, but of
triangular form and concave.  This is the same mechanism used in the
Impossiball.
	The third version is the most common and is shown in Rubik's
Hungarian patent, but is hard to interpret as I've never had the text
translated.  Basically, his 2^3 is a 3^3 with the edge and centre
pieces concealed.  I gather from earlier messages that there were
several versions of this, but I only recall one, but I only ever took
a few apart.
	At the very centre was a cube.  On each face was a square rod
extending almost to the face center.  The ends of these had a +
groove.  Between the rods were pieces in the form of a quadrant with a
groove on the outer, curved, edge.  When all these pieces are in
place, each of the midplanes of the cube is seen to contain a circle
with a groove on its outer edge.  The corner pieces are basically
hollow, but each interior face is a layer ending in a quarter-circular
curve, which fits as a tongue into the groove just mentioned.  Where
two of these meet, at the interior edge of the piece, a section is cut
away to allow the piece to slide past the projections of the end of
the square rods.
 	In theory, one might be able to avoid the quadrant pieces, but
I think they give the structure stability.
	A more serious problem is that the inner, concealed, pieces
can get out of synch with the visible pieces, The early patent of
Gustafson left gaps so one could see the inner pieces and move them.
The method used by Rubik and in some similar puzzles is to fix one
corner piece to the inner structure by some method.  Rubik's 2^3 did
this by making some of the rod ends solid rather than grooved (or
perhaps they were fixed to the central cube so they couldn't rotate).
One could also not notch one of the corner pieces.  Whatever one does,
it must have the effect of preventing one corner from moving in
relation to the inner structure.  I seem to recall that the 4^3 uses
this idea also.
	Don't know how much this helps, but that's the best I can do
off-hand.

 There's a short mention in passing in Douglas Hofstadter's (second
major?) book (Metamagical Themas?) to the effect that a physical
prototype exists for the 6^3, and a paper design for the 7^3. This was
ca. 1982, iirc.

 In mine, just about sure that three adjacent faces of this inner cube
each had thin cylindrical rods extending toward the face centers. These
were surrounded by square rods of the same width as the other three
which were part of the center cube.

 The thin cylindrical rods served as pivots for the square rods of the
same width. When you rotated one half of the Cube, these pivots allowed
one half to rotate with respect to the other without prying anything
apart.

 The three fixed square rods, which are extensions and "part of" the
center cube, stayed fixed within their half of the Cube when the other
half was rotated, much as the ball inside a 4^3 stays fixed.

 The aforementioned rods are required to keep the quadrants from moving
inward and therefore out of engagement with the inner, "cut-away" edges
of the cubies. If that were to happen, the Cube would fall apart.
(Please see the next paragraph.) (When I tried to describe the innards
of a 2^3 a while back, I called these quadrants "clips". My hat's off to
Mr. Singmaster for his fluency!)

 With all due respect, without them, the Cube would instantly fall
apart! They are essential.

}	A more serious problem is that the inner, concealed, pieces
}can get out of synch with the visible pieces.

 The natural tendency is to squeeze the cubies of each half together
when maneuvering.

 Because the thin square rods molded along with the center cube are
"attached" to adjacent faces of that cube, the other three faces of that
cube carry the swiveling rods. No matter how you pick up the Cube, one
half will contain a fixed rod. Squeezing the cubies together around that
rod will make the center cube stay aligned with those four cubies that
are squeezing one of its rods. (Actually, the cubies squeeze the
quadrants, and the quadrants squeeze the rods.)

 Keeping that center cube aligned also means it will keep aligned the
four rods that have their axes in the current shear plane. These rods
will then keep the quadrants aligned with the half of the cubie that is
squeezing the fixed rod.

 The four quadrants in the swiveling half will squeeze the hollow,
swiveling rod, which will rotate around the thin cylindrical [rod] that
extends from that face of the center cube.

 I'm indebted to Mr. Singmaster for his clarifying description.

 This mechanism seems to be a real challenge to describe solely in
words! Here, a few images equal many kB of ASCII...

 Here's another go, for those who have the patience:

 Imagine that each cubie is hollow. (They really are.) Imagine that they
are separated from each other in 3-D space by moderate and equal
distances, but still not tilted with respect to each other. In other
words, there's a large gap between any two.

 Now, imagine a spherical rotary cutter, spinning in the center of the
3-D array of 8 cubies. Move the cubies toward the cutter, along radii of
the cutter passing through their outermost corners. Don't tilt or
rotate, just translate radially inward toward the cutter along a
[45-degree] axis.

 Let the cutter machine a curved outline in each of the three inner
faces. (The diameter of the cutter is maybe 80% of the edge of a
complete Cube.) Make the cutter disappear, and you have a spherical
cutaway inside the whole cluster of eight. (This is real, in essence.)

 The cubies are hollow, and they really have this curved "cut" in each
of their concealed inside faces. Of course, this was molded in, not
machined by a cutter.

 Now, you need something to hold the cubies together.

 If you've seen a radar corner reflector used by small boat owners,
think of one made of three intersecting, mutually-orthogonal circles.
They intersect at a common, center point. Make this corner reflector
tiny, maybe 3,5 (3.5) cm (?) in diameter.

 Cut this apart into eight quadrants. Make them thick, if they aren't.
Make a rectangular groove in each curved edge. Remove some material from
the straight edges; line up the curved edges with a circle (same size as
the original structure before you cut it apart) on your workbench).
Space them equally apart. The gaps form a cross (or an "X", if you like
45-degree angles).  The rods will go into those gaps.

 OK: These are now positioned the way they will be in one of the three
shear planes in a Cube.

 [The radius of the corner reflector is somewhat bigger than that of the
ball cutter.)

 Thinking back to the corner reflector, if you replace all 12 quadrants
where they used to be in 3-D space, with gaps between them as they were
on the bench, that is how they are positioned in an aligned Cube.

 To start assembling the Cube, you take four cubies, lay them down next
to each other (touching) with colors properly aligned, but with their
inside surfaces facing upward. Pick up four quadrants, placing the
grooves you made (in the curved edges) onto the curved "cutaways" in the
adjacent inside edges of the hollow cubies, where the cubies touch. As
long as these quadrants don't move toward each other, they will keep the
cubies together.

 This, in two dimensions, is what holds the Cube together. The next four
quadrants fit into the remaining cutouts. They lie flat, and form a
circle, the way they did when you laid them down on the workbench.

 To keep the quadrants away from the center, you now insert the center
cube and its rods. However, assembling the remaining four cubies (and
their four quadrants) to what you have so far, is, in the real world, a
major struggle. It involves some worrisome distortions of the pieces!
This "geometric interference" is also what makes it so hard to
disassemble.

 Wonder how these are assembled at the factory?

London's most famous toy-shop is Hamley's in Regent St.  On the fourth
floor they have a wall of OddzOn cubes at 39.00 pounds each, together
with snakes and magics.

I say OddzOn because that is the name given in the copyright notice at the
back of the instruction booklet, although in this country that name appears
nowhere else. The packaging (a rectangular cardboard casing with a clear
central panel holding the cube at an angle) gives the distributors as
Toybrokers Ltd.  This cube sometimes appears in the British Toys 'R' Us,
and my family bought one in Jenners, the big Edinburgh department store,
this summer.  I  wouldn't rate it as highly as the Ideal cubes.

I had a quick look for clones in the sort of shop in London that I have
seen them in in the past, but found none.  I bought a couple of Taiwanese
clones in Dublin a few weeks ago - they came in a cube-sized cardboard box
with a picture of a cube on the front with two yellow centre pieces, five
green edge pieces and five red corner pieces.  I did not complain that the
cube inside did not match this picture.  I tried both the sample on display
and one of the cubes which I later bought.  They turned quite well.  I did
not try the other one until I got it home, when to my annoyance I found it
much stiffer.  The colours are rather dull, but yellow and white are
opposite, which I prefer, because then the colours of the opposite faces
seem to have a sensible connection helping recognition of a piece that is
in the opposite face to its home face. They cost 35.00 Irish pounds each .

Among various other puzzle, Hamleys also has those from Meffert, including
the skewb and an annoying dodecahedron - the colours are duplicated at
opposite poles.  So does Toys 'R' Us.  What I have not been able to find is
the 5x5x5 that is shown on the Meffert packaging.

The OddzOn cube is the one that is associated with the www.rubiks.com site,
which reproduces the instruction booklet and uses the same logo in chubby
capitals.  Rubik himself is clearly involved - he is quoted on the site.

I had concluded that Ideal Toys (the US company) had gone out of business,
having failed to find any reference to it currently.  There is a British
company Ideal Toys (UK) Limited, but that is a subsidiary of Triumph Adler
AG.  There was a company The Ideal Toy Company Limited,  but that was
dissolved, as was CBS Toys Limited, which may have been connected.

OddzOn Products Inc appears to be a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc.

I have a suspicion that Ideal may have deliberately adopted the
yellow-opposite-green configuration to create a new colour arrangement that
would help them expunge clones by relying on their trade dress.

Before people get the wrong idea about the price of cubes on this side of
the Atlantic, I'd better say that the OddZon cube was 9 British pounds in
Hamleys and the Dublin clone was 5 Irish pounds.  I used the pound symbol
and the conversion - I suspect both machine and human - went awry.

I can add to my slightly meandering note on the Dublin clone that the
central spider has now bust.  

Life is full of new hazards.

An interesting thing to note regarding the color patterns on cubes...
on the Rubik's Cube home page (http://www.rubiks.com) a picture is
displayed showing Dr. Rubik himself holding a mixed cube in his hand.
On a whim I decided to figure out what the color scheme of the cube
was.

If you wish to figure out yourself without being told, or if you just
want to try to refute my guess (I'm no stranger to being wrong) then
don't read the "answer" to the puzzle that's below my .sig.
Otherwise, if you can't be bothered with minor trivialities like this
one (it's really not that difficult to figure out the colors anyway)
then read on.

Front: Red
Back: Orange
Left: Green
Right: Blue
Top: White

	I'm sure that this has been mentioned before, but the 6^3
etc. actually introduce no further complications than present on the
4^3 (and 5^3).  There are just more types of center pieces, but they
all behave in much the same way.  In my message on notation and
solution of the 4^3, I gave a method of producing a 3-cycle of center
pieces and it can be used for each class of centre pieces - the puzzle
doesn't get any more interesting, just longer!
	The 6^3 introduces a slightly interesting feature
theoretically in that the center pieces break up into more classes
than one might initially expect because the piece at the (1,2)
location is not in the same class as the piece at the (2,1) location.
(Taking a corner as (0,0).)

Message-Id: <19971118.204255.7126.1.tenie1@juno.com>
From: tenie1@juno.com (Tenie Remmel)

Is there an easy way to cycle three adjacent top edges on the
Rubiks Revenge?  I can't find one shorter than 62 moves, but if
there was a short one I could simplify my solution greatly.

. b c .    . a b .
a . . . => c . . .
. . . .    . . . .
. . . .    . . . .

Hopefully it won't mess up the corners, but it's ok if it does.

I'd also like to see some short moves for the following 3-cycles:

. * * .    . . * .    . . . .    . . * .
. . . .    * . . *    * . . *    . . . *
* . . .    . . . .    . . . *    * . . .
. . . .    . . . .    . . . .    . . . .

Is there a good source anywhere for moves, pretty patterns, etc. for
the Rubiks Revenge?  It's quite difficult to find information about
it.  Also is there an automatic move generating program for the higher
order cubes like 'Cube Explorer' is for the 3x3x3?

I hold the cube so the bottom looks like this:

. . a .
. . . b
. . . c
. . . .

and do this sequence:

  F' b2 L2 / R' D r' D' R D r D' / L2 b2 F

Capital letters are outer slices.  Small letters are inner slices.
The slashes are just to show the different parts of the sequence.  The
middle part, if performed alone, will cycle three edges.  The first
part of the sequence positions the cubies we want to move into the
positions of the cubies that are cycled by the middle sequence.  The
last part of the sequence simply reverses the first part.

Left view of cube:

  . . . .
  . . . a
  . . . .
  . c b .

  b2 R2 / L D' l D L' D' l' D / R2 b2

Bottom view of cube:

  . . a .
  c . . b
  . . . .
  . . . .

  F' / R' D r' D' R D r D' / F

Bottom view of cube:

  . . . .
  a . . c
  . . . b
  . . . .

  b2 U' F / R' D r' D' R D r D' / F' U b2

Bottom view of cube:

  . . a .
  . . . b
  c . . .
  . . . .

  F' b' L2 / R' D r' D' R D r D' / L2 b F

Here are some other three cycles you may find useful:

  R' D l D' R D l' D'
  R' D L D' R D L' D'
  r' D l D' r D l' D'

The way I approach this is to begin with the following simple 3-cycle for
edge cubies (note that this cycles only the cubies and leave the rest of
the cube unaltered):

1] Imagine the involved cubies in the following configuration:

Top face :  . . c .      Left face: . . . .
            . . . .                 a . . .
            . . . .                 . . . .
            . b . .                 . . . .

2] Perform the following sequence:

 - Rotate Front Face by 1/4 turn clockwise.
 - Rotate the slice just below the Top Layer by 180 dgs.
 - Rotate the Front Face by 1/4 turn counter-clockwise.
 - Rotate the Top Face by 180 dg.
 - Rotate Front Face by 1/4 turn clockwise.
 - Rotate the slice just below the Top Layer by 180 dgs.
 - Rotate the Front Face by 1/4 turn counter-clockwise.
 - Rotate the Top Face by 180 dg.

This will result in:

Top face :  . . b .      Left face: . . . .
            . . . .                 c . . .
            . . . .                 . . . .
            . a . .                 . . . .

with all other cubies in their original locations.

3] Once this step is mastered, it is now only a question of moving the
cubies that you want to swap into the approriate location for this operator
to do its work.

For example, in your example above this can be accomplished by (this
assumes that the figure you have drawn above is your Top Face):

 - Rotating the Left-most two slices 1/4 turn clockwise (i.e. towards you)
 - Rotating the Top Face 1/4 turn counter-clockwise.

If you now rotate the entire cube by 90dgs clockwise, you will see your
three cubies are now in the proper location to use the above operator.
(When you're done with the operator, repeat the steps just above in the
reverse order to finish.)

>. . . .    . . . .    . . . .    . . . .

These are just variations on the above.  They will be left an exercise for
the reader.  ;-)

Hope this helps.

Actually, you can save a couple moves by doing

d2 L' R' D r' D' R D r D' L d2

but the pieces affected will be on the right side instead of the bottom.

You can cycle these three edges on the 4x4x4 in 14 quarter turns
without disturbing the corners.

With the "up" and "front" faces like this (in a kind of projection view;
the corners are given by "*"; the "right" face is not shown),

       *  .  .  *
      .  .  .  .
     .  .  .  C
    *  A  B  *
    .  .  .  .
    .  .  .  .
    *  .  .  *

a procedure to cyle A,B,C is as follows:
 (1) 2 preparation moves which put C on "down" slice and B on "up/back"
 (2) 3 moves to get A off top slice and replace with C.
 (3) 2 moves (1/2 rotate) the top slice to put B where C (orginally A) was.
 (4) undo (2), restoring bottom layers and bring A back to top, in new spot.
 (5) undo (3)
 (6) undo (1), the prep moves.

(In each case "undo" means to do the inverse of the same moves in the
opposite order; that is,  "undo" ABC means C'B'A' where C' is the inverse
of move C.)

The hardest part I have of describing the specifics of each of
these is the notation; each of the 6 steps is only a couple of moves.

Let me define U,R,F as the Up, Right, and Front faces, and
number the slices by integers 1 to 4, so for example (F1,F2,F3,F4)
are clockwise quarter turns on the 4 slices (front to back)
parallel to the front face.  Counterclockwise turns are indicated
with either a ' (indicating "inverse") or lower case, so
F1' = a counterclockwise quarter turn of the front face.

In pictures,

        *  -  -  *                      *  -  -  *
      .  1  2  .                      .  3  1  .
     .  3  4  .                      .  4  2  .
    *  -  -  *     ==>  U1 ==>      *  -  -  *
    |  a  b  |                      |  a  b  |
    |  c  d  |                      |  c  d  |
    *  -  -  *                      *  -  -  *


        *  -  -  *                      *  -  -  *
      .  1  2  .                      .  1  2  .
     .  3  4  .                      .  3  4  .
    *  -  -  *     ==>  F1' ==>     *  -  -  *
    |  a  b  |                      |  b  d  |
    |  c  d  |                      |  a  c  |
    *  -  -  *                      *  -  -  *

where the letters are on the "front" face
and the numbers are on "up" face.

Then with this notation, steps (1) through (6) of this procedure are
  (1) F2  R2
  (2) F3' U4' F3
  (3) U1  U1
  (4) F3' U4  F3'
  (5) U1'  U1'
  (6) R2' F2'
which is 14 moves.

[Moderator's note: Certainly (4) should be F3' U4 F3, but that still
 cycles the wrong edges.  With (2)=R2 U4' R2', (4)=R2 U4 U2' we cycle
 the correct triple of edges, but in inverse order. ]

I confess that I don't have a 4x4x4 anymore and so can't try this -
I may have visualized one of the details wrong.  Hope not.

You can do any of these as variations of the method I give above
with different "preperation" moves to get the edges into the
proper positions, namely two on the same slice which can be turned
into one another (the top slice in these cases),
and the third on another slice (usually the bottom slice) which
can replace one of the edges from the top slice.

I have a discussion of the NxNxN cube which includes in section (VI)
this recipe for 3-cycles of any kind of edge, corner, or face
piece; you can read it at
http://www.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/cube/NxN.txt if you're interested.

Forget three adjacent top edges, I just want to cycle two of them.  I've
been solving a 5x5x5, and finally figured out how to make it look like a
3x3x3 so that I could solve nearly all of it.  However, the one place where
I cannot do that is solving the second and fourth edges from any side, and
have been using a short move that cycles three of them:

.axx.      .bxx.
y....      z....
y....  =>  z....
b....      a....
.czz.      .cyy.

The move is 2L F' L F 2L' (where 2L means the second layer from the
left)

This works great for getting nearly all the edges in place, but I have
two edges that are switched, and every time I use this move to put
them in place, I either leave two other edges out of place or leave
four edges out of place.  That is, I have the following:

.baa.                              .aaa.
b....                              c....
b....  which I can only make into  c....
a....                              b....
.ccc.                              .cbb.

which does not help.

I believe that my move works on 4x4x4 edges, and any move that helps a 4x4x4
cube will probably help me.

Rather than just throw a few more solutions into the pot, I'd like to start
with some comments on the sort of process everyone, including me, seems to
use to deliver 3-cycles of edge pieces in the 4x4x4.  It is of the general
form

    [P, TQT']

where the square brackets are used to show a commutator, that is, [A,B]
means ABA'B'.

In this process P and Q are turns of layers that are parallel to one
another, and T is a turn of a layer transverse to P and Q.  For instance, P
and Q could be L and r and T could be U (capitals for the outer layers,
lower case for the neighbouring inner layers, with sense parallel to the
corresponding outer layer).  That gives

   [L, UrU'] == L UrU'.L' Ur'U'

which is a (not especially appealing) 3-cycle of edges.

In fact any process of this form is a 3-cycle provided it takes one piece
from the layer Q into the layer P.  That will happen if T is a quarter turn
in either sense - I haven't found anything useful with T as a half turn.
But P and Q can be any power.  The reason that processes of this form are
3-cycles is simple.  If two permutations intersect at only one element,
then their commutator is a 3-cycle.  Thus if

   A = (...a1, x, a2...) and B = (...b1, x, b2...)

then

   [A,B] -> (a1, x, b1)

If you do just UrU' you will find there is a line of displaced pieces along
the intersection Ub, but no other displaced piece in any of the layers
parallel to r.  Any of these pieces can be picked out to form part of a
3-cycle by selecting the layer that is parallel to r and contains the piece
and using a turn of that layer as the component P of the commutator, with
UrU' forming the component TQT'.

In general, if all of P, Q and T are outer layers we will have a 3-cycle of
corner pieces, if two are outer layers and one an inner layer we will have
a 3-cycle of edge pieces, if one is an outer layer and the other two inner
layers we will have a 3-cycle of centre pieces, and if all three are inner
layers we will have done nothing visible to the cube, but in fact there
will have been an invisible 3-cycle of the pieces of the imaginary internal
2x2x2.

We can derive the last of these cases from the first
quite neatly applying a fascinating concept called evisceration, which I
recently met trawling through the archives. It was first quoted from David
Singmaster's Cubic Circular by Stan Isaacs on 26 May 1983 and our present
acting moderator also discussed it on 1 June 1983. If you turn a cube
inside out by changing each outer layer in a process into an inner and
vice-versa (i.e. capitals to lower case), then, in the effect of the
process, you will interchange corner pieces with the pieces of the internal
2x2x2, and edge pieces with centre pieces. Making P, Q and T all to be
outer layers gives just a 3-cycle of corner pieces; therefore applying
evisceration takes that cycle into one on the pieces of the internal 2x2x2.

Singmaster's Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube, the fifth edition, interprets
processes of the type

   [P, TQT']

as

   [P,[T,Q]].

This expands to P TQT'Q'.P' QTQ'T', but the sequence Q'P'Q in the centre
reduces to just P', giving the same expansion as before. Of course, the two
components of the commutators TQT' and [T,Q] have different total effects,
but what they have in common is that they put the same single piece into P.
 We can look at them both as being sort of like a mono-operation.  Let's
call it a "monopop": each process pops a piece into P; you then turn P,
then reverse the pop operation, which extracts a different piece, and
finally restore P.

It's relatively straightforward to use this form to design specific
processes.  Say we want to move an edge piece from ULf to FLd and keep the
third member of the 3-cycle in the top layer.  Then we can take P to be L
to achieve the required part of the cycle.  We now know that Q must be in r
or l.  Let's take l.  The transverse move in T has to take a piece from l
into the point of intersection of the two components of the commutator,
FLd.  So it must be in F. Playing with F and l shows that the following
does the job.

   [L, FlF'] == L FlF'. L' Fl'F' -> (ULf, FLd, UBl)

If we'd taken Q to be in r we'd have needed a bit more care to keep the
third piece of the 3-cycle in the top layer, but [L, F'r^2F] does, putting
it at UBr.

If we want to move a piece along a diagonal - from ULf to FLu, say - we
need to use the other component of the commutator, TQT'.  Thus we can build
3-cycles which include ULf to FLu around the component U'FU.  For instance

   [f', U'FU] -> (ULf, LFu, RUf)

With a clear head and a good following wind it's possible to work out these
processes on the fly.

They also transform nicely into another process of the same type by cycling
the elements, which has the effect of conjugating the original process.
Thus the last process can be dealt with as follows

   U[f', U'FU]U' = [Uf'U', F] -> (UFr, LFu, BUr)

This cycling procedure comes from Singmaster.

Let's now think about top-layer edge processes. I'll denote the pieces like
this.


   X a1 a2 X

   d2 o o b1

   d1 o o b2

   X c2 c1 X

The purpose of the numbering in pairs is to emphasize that the processes
come in pairs.  Each process has a twin created by changing each inner
layer turn into its next-door inner neighbour. Thus the simplest U process
of the general type we're using is of this form:

   [l, F'LF] -> (a1, c2, d1)

Its twin is

   [r', F'LF] -> (a2, c1, d2)

In the twin process, each edge piece is changed into its next door
neighbour.

We want to capture this regularity.  I will therefore represent this pair
by

   [M', F'LF] -> (a*, c', d)

In this representation, M is either r or l', the asterisked piece defines
the layer that contains M and primed letters denote a piece with the
opposite suffix number to the asterisked piece.  Obviously, these suffixes
are closely related to flip in a 3x3x3 and the assignment of the numbers is
arbitrary.  Some assignments are more helpful than others in a particular
context, and the method used in the diagram above is the obvious one of
giving the same number ("flipperty"?) to the pieces in the positions that a
single piece moves into during a complete U turn.

Here, then is a complete set of top layer 3-cycles of edge pieces, to
within a reflection.  It comes from a fairly systematic search I did for
processes of the type [P, TQT'] that can be conjugated by at most one turn
into a top-layer process. They are oriented in a way I find easy to do.

I will leave them as commutators, because it is very easy to perform the
full set of turns from them.  The T/T' sequence remains constant for both
halves and the only adjustment needed is to invert P and Q the second time
around.  Inverses are also easy to perform, since all one has to do is read
off the second component first.

   (a*, c', d) [M', F'LF]

   (a*, b, c)    F2 [D R2 D', M2] F2

   (c*, a, b')    R2 [M' D' M, U2] R2

   (d1, b2, b1)   (Bb)' [U l U', R2] (Bb)
   (d2, b1, b2)   (Ff) [U r' U', R2] (Ff)'

   (d2, c2, d1)   (Bb) [L2, D l D'] (Bb)'  (Tenie's question)
   (d1, c1, d2)   f' [L2, D r' D'] f

The last two pairs could have been left in the M form if say N was
introduced to represent either f or b'. But keeping them separate lets us
save a wrist movement for the first three by combining the inner and
neighbouring outer layers for a turn relative to the central cut.  That
won't work for the final process, since the F layer is already included in
the 3-cycle and can't be amalgamated with the f layer.

All these process can be directly transferred to the 3x3x3, using the one
single central slice as M (or l' or r).  The primes then correspond to
flipping the edge piece relative to the top surface.

I realize this is impossible to make, at least in the traditional way, but...

I just saw an add for some computer conference which displayed a 9x9x9 cube
(with  some rather strange colors - at least 7 different ones too!).  The
text read something like (really paraphrased):

"When you were young you could work a cube in 27 seconds, but now you're
older and only have a week to solve this."

So, my question is: Assuming the cube is solvable, can it be done?  What
kind of order of growth to the current algorithms, for human algorithms and
computer algorithms, have in relation to the size of the cube?

Count me among the few "self-taught" solvers who don't actually
use this, then.  The one I worked out for myself a long time ago
turns out to be:

[r, FUF']

which is of a similar form, but P and Q are not parallel.

As a consequence of this, the permutation is not "clean": i.e.,
some other cubies get disturbed.  As these are all face cubies
anyway, I just modified my solution so that I do the face cubies
last.  :-)

How about, "yay?"  I hope that by having the cube re-emerge and become
once again a fairly popular item, many other unique pieces will make a
return, like the RUBIKS REVENGE, as an example.  And perhaps then they
will become a stable commodity instead of just burning out after just an
intense period of a couple of years.  A Hula Hoop is a fad.  A piece
like the Cube is Timeless.

 Jin Kim's comment, with which I heartily agree, leads me to wonder
whether some entrepreneur might support small-scale manufacture of a
very well-made 3^3, on the order of the Ideal deluxe Cube (I have
forgotten what they called it).

 That Cube had a redesigned mechanism (it differed only in the details)
that would tolerate much more misalignment, before making a maneuver,
than the typical Cubes. It had attached plastic colored tiles instead of
stickers, and was made of an excellent "engineering plastic".

 There are commercially-available materials that are self-lubricating,
and these could be used for the wearing surfaces. The pivots could be
true bearings, that is to say, like those in a typical piece
of machinery. (The Ideal Cube might have had such.} Tests to 250,000
revolutions might be reasonable.

 Whether it makes sense to try to improve upon that already very-good
design, I can't say.

 Consider chess, go, checkers or dominoes. I think the Cube quite
rightly should take its place with them.

 Imho, the Cube and its direct derivatives are the most ingenious
mechanisms ever invented.

I just got one of these for christmas and had a question or two.  First is
there a cube program so I can play with it and not destroy all the work I
have done?  And I have solved one side, and all of the edges without much
problems.  However, can I solve the middle pieces without destroying the
edges?  As of yet I haven't found a way to keep the one side I have
finished and move one of the center pieces on another side.  I don't want
moves, I just want to know if it is possible to solve this way or if I
need to start looking at another way to solve it.

From: jdavenport@scudder.com (Jacob Davenport)
Subject: Re: 5x5x5
To: "Cube Lovers" <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

My way of solving the 5x5x5 has been to think about the cube in 3x3x3
terms.  When I solve a 3x3x3, I do top corners, bottom corners, top
and bottom edges at the same time, and then middle edges.

When I do a 5x5x5, I think of the middle corners (those cubies
directly diagonal from the center) as corners to the 3x3x3, ignoring
completely the outside edges, and I solve them so that all the middle
corners are aligned like a 3x3x3 would be aligned.  Then I solve the
middle edges (those cubies directly next to the center) like I would
solve the edges from 3x3x3 cubes.  This leaves the nine cubies in the
center of each face sovled.

I then use a move which many people use when solving a 4x4x4 to get
all the edge pieces together without disturbing the center squares.
This finally leaves me with messed up corners, solved center squares,
and the three edges on each side together.  I then view this as a
3x3x3 and solve that using my normal method.  The only drawback is
that I sometimes cannot get the edges to all work together, and the
reason is that I have inadvertantly switched two middle corners, and
it takes a long time for me to fix them.

If anyone wants more information on this solution, I'll spell it out
in detail on my web page.

 one to practice 4x4x4 moves by ignoring the central slices (except in
 that you  have to keep them aligned with an adjacent slice).]

NWell, this is more a "cube-sighting" than an answer to the question whether
cubes will soon become more easily available, but I notice that in the new
(i.e. 4Jan98) New York Times Book Review, on the  inside of the front cover
is a small ad consisting of a (b&w) photo of a (3X) cube with the
over-laying copy:

          NEVER
            A
           DULL
         WEEKEND

   Our enhanced, two-part
     Weekend section is
   full of ideas about ways
      to broaden your
         horizons.


I couldn't quite figure out, though, whether the ad intended the cube to
symbolize the "broaden[ed] horizons", or the "dull weekend"...

Subject: "A Message from Professor Erno Rubik"

I just accidentally tripped across http://www.rubiks.com/.  Much to my
amusement the home page has a little message from Erno Rubik that begins:

  It is 23 years since I created the Cube, some 17 years since this simple
  little six-coloured object attained its great world wide appeal. I often
  wondered what impact the Internet would have had if it had been around at
  the time.  Cube awareness, for one thing, would have spread even faster,
  aggravating the already severe Cube shortages in the market place.
  Suggestions and disputes about different approaches to solving it would
  surely have filled the screens. Amusing, unusual, interesting tales to do
  with the Cube would have criss-crossed the globe on the Net and intrigued
  mathematicians would have proposed and discussed Cube related theories
  on-line.

Those of you who have been on this mailing list for the last 17 years will
recognize this as an uncannily accurate description of exactly what -did-
happen!  (Except, of course, the Net was so much smaller then that we had
little effect on the market place.)

So accurate is Prof. Rubik's description that I'd be surprised if he (or his
ghost writer) hasn't actually read through some of our earliest archives.

Yes, if the corners of the top layer are also in the right place.  You can
move them around by normal 3x3x3 moves, but in doing so you may find that
the parity of the edge pieces is changed.  If you can swap a pair of edge
pieces on a 4x4x4, all will be well, and all the pieces in the ring of
eight around the piece at the centre of each face can be dealt with by
3-cycles to move these pieces to a different face or around on the same
face.

There is a hidden complication.  The new type of pieces introduced by the
5x5x5 are those at N, S, E and W in the central block of nine in each face.
 If the corner pieces of the cube are correctly placed, the parity of these
new pieces is tied to that of the edge pieces introduced by the 4x4x4, i.e.
those next to the corner pieces of the cube.  So if a pair of these edge
pieces is swapped, so will be a pair of the new 5x5x5 central pieces.  But
the swap of the edge pieces will cure them at the same time.  Often the
change to the centre pieces will not even show, because it will take place
within the same face.  Thus the sequence Georges Helm gave some time ago to
swap the 4x4x4 edges also cures the 5x5x5 centre pieces.  If it is applied
to a cube in the start position, it swaps Bl and Br visibly, and
interchanges FHl and FHr (where H is the central slice parallel to U)
invisibly.  It also makes an even-parity change to the 4x4x4 centre pieces
on the front face - in fact it rotates by 180 degrees the (l, u+H+d) and
(r, u+H+d) strips on this face.

Kristin,

Not to brag or anything, but I first solved the cube when I was 7 years
old.  I'm 22 now and still haven't lost interest.

I have some new search results for the face turn metric.  Here is a
summary of the new search.

The results at 8f and 9f from Start are new.  Previously, the face turn
metric had only been searched through 7f from Start.  All the results in
terms of patterns (M-conjugacy classes) are new.  Previously, the face
turn metric had been searched only in terms of positions.

Note that the branching factor does not change very much.  We already know
(or strongly suspect by statistical arguments based on the results of
Kociemba, Winter, Reid, and Korf) that it cannot change much this close to
Start.  Otherwise, the mode of the distribution would be greater than the
18f which is strongly suspected to be the case.

I have not yet installed the logic to detect weak local maxima.  The logic
to detect strong local maxima is installed with an interesting result. Two
patterns were detected at 9f from Start which are strong local maxima.
Regrettably, I have no idea what they are.  I will have to add something
to the program to print out strong local maxima when they are detected.
All I know is that the patterns are at least "somewhat symmetric" in that
they collectively represent only 32 positions.

I have begun to suspect that strong local maxima are fairly rare in the
face turn metric.  Recall that a strong local maximum is one where all 18
face turns carry the cube closer to Start.  A weak local maximum, by
contrast, is a local maximum where at least one face turn leaves the cube
the same distance from Start.  If I have not made a mistake in analyzing
them (which is entirely possible), the only one of Mike Reid's "highly
symmetric" positions which is a strong local maximum is superflip.  Even
Pons Asinorum is not a strong local maximum.

This is a little off topic, but many cube searching programs run for
dozens or hundreds of hours and we are always interested in speeding
them up.  The best speed ups usually come from algorithm improvements,
but I am also interested in more mundane program improvements.

Through the years, I have used various tools, usually for FORTRAN,
usually on mainframes, which will analyze a running program, telling you
where (which routines, which lines of source code) the program is
spending its time.  I am now running mostly C programs, mostly on a PC.
I confess I am clueless as to what performance analysis tools might be
available in this environment.  (I use Borland C++ if it matters.)  Any
suggestions would be gratefully accepted.

Subject: MEGAMINX
Message-Id: <Pine.OSF.3.96.980116175549.13054B-100000@platon>

The following is based on an email I sent recently to Kurt Endl.  He says that
he does not have time to work on this at present, and, with a thesis to write,
nor do I!  I expect that someone has heard of this and the answer is
known--I am new to this discussion group.  Otherwise, hopefully
someone will find it sufficiently interesting to think it through.

I was delighted to be given a MEGAMINX this Christmas, together with
Kurt Endl's instruction booklet.  I resolved to attempt the puzzle
without looking in the booklet, at least at first.

My approach was similar--I built a solution in layers, starting
at the bottom (which I shall call the north pole, consistent with the
notation in the latter part of the book) and proceeding, layer by
later towards the south pole.  I was successful in my efforts until I
reached the south cap, at which point I became stuck.  My problem was to
position and orient the south pole edges.  Try as I might, the best I
could do was to reach a position where two south pole edges needed to be
exchanged.  And try as I might, I could not find a way to do this.

After a week, I gave up and turned to the instructions.  I was delighted
to see that their approach was similar to mine, and fascinated by the
simple moves L_{**}, L^{**}, R_{**} and R^{**} used.  My
methods were, of course, far less elegant.

I was able to start at section 8, `Setting the South Pole
edges'.  The procedure for setting the edges affects the southern
equatorial corners, which you then arrange later.  My layer-by-layer
approach had, of course, already set these corners correctly before
attempting the south pole edges (and indeed before setting the southern
equatorial edges).  Perhaps this was the key?  Having the southern
equatorial corners set should not affect the validity of the book's method,
which should work with any arrangement of these corners.  But following
the instructions, I was unable to position the last two south pole edges
correctly.  The statement ``The remaining two South Pole edges will be
correctly placed again at the same time'' on page 21, section 8 of the
instructions must be incorrect--here after all was a counterexample!  My
last two south pole edges needed to be exchanged.

I ignored the problem for the time being.  I oriented the two edges
correctly, with them still in the wrong positions.  I was then able to
complete the MEGAMINX, positioning and orienting the southern equatorial
and south pole corners as in the instructions.  The result was a complete
MEGAMINX, except that it appeared that two little triangular stickers,
each on the border of the southern cap, had been exchanged.

After some thought, I have found a way out of this problem.  I believe
that this is a detail that may be required for solution in some
circumstances that is not in this instruction booklet.  I will try to
describe what I think went wrong.

The twelve faces of the MEGAMINX are coloured using only six colours, with
opposite faces bearing the same colour.  Thus, each edge piece has an
`identical twin' on the opposite side of the completed MEGAMINX.  When
solving the MEGAMINX from a totally jumbled position, these twins are
indistinguishable and may therefore be assigned either to their own
original position, or to their twin's position at random.  In this sense
the solution of MEGAMINX is not unique.  (Strictly, the solution may still
be unique but we have not proved conclusively that it is so, and have
demonstrated reason to believe that it may not be.)

Now, suppose we return to the two edges I wished to exchange.  Imagine
them as south pole edges also in adjacent faces.  Turn the MEGAMINX so
that the two faces concerned are in the left and right positions (using
your terminology).  We need to exchange these edges, but the problem we
have is that every sequence of moves seems to rotate 3 edges cyclicly,
rather than exchange a pair!  For example, the book uses L_{**} or R_{**} to
bring one of the two edges concerned down into the front southern
equatorial edge (``...the edge we have misused so brutally...''), and the
same moves to move it back up again.  But these moves, together with any I
can find, cycle 3 edges.  How can moves cycling 3 edges be used to
exchange just 2 edges?  I was stuck.

The solution comes from the `identical twins' I talked about before.
Suppose one of the two edges I'm interested in is, say, yellow/blue, and
the other yellow/orange, so the southern pole is yellow.  Tucked away on
the opposite side of MEGAMINX is *another* yellow/blue edge.  By a simple
sequence of moves, this may be brought into the postion of the front
southern equatorial edge.  Now consider cycling these three edges.  As two
of the edges are identical, cycing these three edges *looks* like a swapping
of just two edges!  Now we return to the other side of MEGAMINX the twin
of the piece that was originaly there.  (Some fixing of the MEGAMINX is
required to repair the damage caused by bringing an edge from the opposite
side of the MEGAMINX to the front and sending it's twin back, but this
isn't too hard.) Now, having apparently `swapped' two adjacent edges, we
can proceed as per the instructions and complete the MEGAMINX.  This I
have done.

Have any other people encountered this problem, or was I just
extremely unlucky?  The question arising is, of course, just how many
solutions of MEGAMINX are there?  There are 10 of these `identical
twin' edge pairs.  I reckon swapping just one twin pair is not possible in
a complete solution, but that swapping any even number of twins may be
(unproven), and so there are 512 solutions, each of which would be
distinct if 12 different colours had been used on the original puzzle.
Does anyone fancy having a stab at this conjecture?

In my opinion Jonathan is quite right in his analysis of the problem and
its solution.  When cubes or similar puzzles are coloured ambiguously, it
is always possible that the puzzle will be in an apparently impossible
configuration which must be cured by a move which changes identically
coloured pieces in an invisible way.  I am lucky enough to have a
dodecahedron puzzle from the 80s called the Supernova, which was made in
Hungary and sold in the UK by Pentangle.  That used twelve different
colours, and the problem did not arise.  Perhaps the instructions for the
Megaminx were originally written for this form.

Other puzzles can show similar effects - the variant of the cube with the
vertical edges bevelled so that it is octagonal in horizontal cross-section
has edge-pieces in the middle horizontal slice that have only one colour,
so their orientation is ambiguous and the top and bottom edge-pieces can
appear to have impossible flip states, such a single edge-piece flipped.

Jonathan remarks that every sequence of moves seems to rotate 3 edges
cyclically.  The reason (as usual) is to be found in parity considerations.
A single turn of  a face of the dodecahedron yields two 5-cycles, one of
the edge-pieces and one of the corners.  Both these are even permutations,
and it is therefore impossible to create a permutation of odd parity by any
combination of turns.  Hence a 3-cycle is the minimum possible, and a
single 2-cycle is impossible.

Obviously any 3-cycle of edges can in principle be conjugated into a form
to solve Jonathan's problem, but I thought I'd look for a process for a
3-cycle of edge-pieces which would take one piece from the bottom into the
top and preserve orientation (in the sense that the faces in the top and
bottom remain so).  I don't have the instruction booklet that goes with the
Megaminx, so I don't know what notation it used, or indeed what anyone else
may have used for this puzzle, so with the usual apologies if I'm ignoring
a standard notation:

Position the puzzle on a table, so there is a horizontal top plane and
bottom plane, and turn it so that one of the faces in the top band directly
faces you.  Call that face F, the top T, the two faces on either side of F
respectively Ru on the right and Lu on the left, and the two faces in the
lower band that join in the centre Rl on the right and Ll on the left (i.e.
u=upper and l=lower).  The arrangement of faces you see is thus (nb use a
non-proportionally spaced typeface);

                 T

          Lu     F      Ru

             Ll      Rl

                 D
Then

Rl Ll' T Ru Lu' F^2 Ru' Lu  T' Ru Lu' F^-2 Ru' Lu  Ll Rl'

does (TRu, TF, Drl).

Yes, you can swap pairs of edges - this is an even permutation which can be
composed out of 3-cycles, and in general any even number of swaps is
possible.

It is not so difficult to prove.  Just as with the cube, also for the
dodecahedron it is easy to see that whenever you turn a face, the
parity of the edge and corner permutations remain the same.  So a
single swap of two edges is not possible, that is an odd permutation
and would also require an odd permutation of the corner.  However,
interchanging two pairs is possible.  Actually any even permutation
of the edges is possible with the corners in place.  This is because
there are simple procedures that rotate a triple of edges, leaving the
corners in place.  Actually these procedures can be extremely similar
to those used for the cube.  Anyhow, this proves it.

[ Moderator's note: Lest a reader misunderstand, let me note that the
  parity situation is different between the cube and megaminx.  On the
  cube an odd permutation of edges is achievable provided the corner
  permutation is also odd.  On the megaminx, neither the corner
  permutation nor the edge permutation can ever be odd. ]

This is a recently re-issued version of the Megaminx, using 6 colors
instead of 12. This puzzle is available at
Spielkiste <http://www.twfg.de/puzzle/default.htm>
The original Meffert Megaminx, however, used 12 colors, and the same
goes for a slightly different hungarian version called Supernova.
Christoph Bandelow <Christoph.Bandelow@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> still has a
few of the latter for sale.

This indeed is caused by the fact that in this version of the puzzle
there exist 15 (not 10) pairs of edges that are alike. Thus solving the
puzzle is somewhat similar to solving Alexander's Star and Impossiball
at the same time!

On 1/6/98 Jonathan Tuliani described a Megaminx with 6 colors.  I have
a Megaminx purchased when they first came out.  It has 10 colors.
They are positioned so that there is only one "twin" pair on the
puzzle.  There are two red/yellow edge pieces.  It was a major
personal discovery when I found that the puzzle was only solvable if
the red/yellow pieces were put in the "right" places.  Only having one
twin pair made the puzzle particularly difficult because it took so
long before I noticed their existence.

I am sure that many readers will want to know if Megaminx is back in
production.  Jonathan, were did yours come from?

jerry writes about strong local maxima in the face turn metric.
he says that superflip is such a position, but pons asinorum is not.
there are some other positions with a high degree of symmetry that are
also strong local maxima, for example

     pons asinorum  composed with  superflip
     superfliptwist
     supertwist

and some of the  T-symmetric positions that may not have standard names

     #1.  B  U  L' F' U  R  U2 D2 F' L  U' B' L  D  R2 L2 B2
     #4.  D' R' U  B' D' R' L  F  L  B' R' F  B' U  L  D' F  U' D2

and there might be more among the  H-symmetric  and  T-symmetric
positions (i can't tell right now without doing more searching).

yes, strong local maxima in the face turn metric are probably quite rare.
in the quarter turn metric, any global maximum is necessarily a local
maximum, because of parity considerations.  however, in the face turn
metric, a global maximum is a local maximum, but it may not be a strong one!
so the only strong local maxima we have here are found as a result of
(lots of) computer searching.

i look forward to seeing your 2 strong local maxima at distance 9f from
start.

I'm glad my comments regarding MEGAMINX seemed to have sparked interest.
As someone points out, and as I realised over the weekend, there are of
course 15 pairs of `twin' edges, not 10 as I stated before.  Of course the
conjecture I made (suggested by one correspondent to be true, but well
beyond my group theory) would mean there are then 2^{15-1} = 16384
`distinct' complete solutions to this version of the puzzle!

I'll ask my friend where he got the MEGAMINX and the instruction booklet
from.  He said there were a fair few other similar puzzles there as well.

I have not yet added the logic for weak local maxima, but further perusing
of my printout from the run which has already been made does yield a bit
of confirmation to some previous results reported by others.

At each distance from Start, my program summarizes the number of patterns
and positions by the symmetry class (one of the 33 symmetry classes of M,
the group of 48 symmetries of the cube).  Hence, I can easily look for
"highly symmetric" positions based on the symmetry class.  Of the 72
positions defined as q-transitive by Jim Saxe and Dan Hoey in Symmetry and
Local Maxima, only 4 of them show up in the search through 9f.  One of
them is at 0f (Start), one of them is at 6f (Pons Asinorum, a weak local
maximum, only the six half turns move closer to Start), and two of them
are at 8f (the two conjugate 6-H positions, weak local maxima with only
the six half turns moving closer to Start).

We therefore know that the two patterns at 9f which are strong local
maxima are not q-transitive, and cannot be shown to be local maxima by
symmetry considerations alone.

Strictly speaking, we already knew all this based on Dan's study of Pons
Asinorum from many years ago, and based on Mike Reid's recent studies of
highly symmetric positions with his optimal cube solver.  Jim Saxe found
the 8f processes for the 6-H positions many years ago, but I do not
believe that they were shown to be minimal until Mike's recent work.

That will probably be similar to the one I saw in the February edition
of Visual Basic Programmer's Journal on page 90. I wanted to post
about this one, but somehow forgot...

Although, I think a deadline of one week to solve it should be enough
time...after I worked out the 5x5x5, the 9x9x9 should be just more of
the same :-)

It's kind of difficult to find the Cubes in Toy's R Us but they are there.
They also have some new game out for two people, but I don't remember what
it's called.  I know that the cubes are not where you would expect them to
be, with other games and puzzles, they are normally on an end cap near the
front of the stores on the bottom shelf.  Also a lot of the other toy
stores have them and they all have them in strange places around the store.

I don't think that I have seen anything new besides the new game.  They
normally sell the cube, snake, magic rings, and a pyramid that comes apart
and you put back together.

I just heard there's a new puzzle out in the U.S. called "Lights Out Cube".
My first thought was that it's probably from the same company (Tiger
Electronics) who introduced the "Lights Out" and "Deluxe Lights Out".
Anybody who can confirm or knows some more??
It would also be nice if anyone knew a store in the San Francisco Area
where these puzzles are available (i have a friend who can buy them for
me). I haven't seen them in Europe.

Yes the cube is by the makers of Lights Out.  It is available here in the
U.S. at places like Target and Wal-Mart.  It's quite a conversation piece
because people often ask if it's an electronic Rubik's Cube!  Of course it's
just a 3-D version of the Lights Out game.  It's fun because the puzzles get
progressively more difficult, plus there is a multi-player mode.

Date: Sat, 14 Feb 1998 14:37:00 -0000

        I have a website at

        http://Byrden.com/puzzles/

where I keep playable versions of many
varieties of cube, pyramid, dodecahedron,
etc etc. All of them are built in Java
and have an "undo" button allowing you
to explore your moves.

        The site was titled "The Rubik Gallery"
in honour of Erno Rubik. It explicitly said
that there was no further connection with him.

        I got a letter from a Washington
firm of lawyers about a week ago, saying
that they were the advisers to Seven Towns
Limited, holders of the 'Rubik' trademark.
The site was "diluting" the value of the
trademark and causing "customer confusion".
I was engaging in "unfair competition"
(despite not selling or distributing anything
or taking any money or having any advertising
on the site).

        Not only did they want the word 'Rubik'
removed from the website, they wanted one of
the Java puzzles removed as well. They called it
an "electronic version of the RUBIK'S CUBE".
Fair enough, being a hexahedron sliced into 26
equal parts it bore a certian visual resemblance,
but obviously there was none of their mechanism
involved. It was all brand-new software.

        Anyway, I took it off, and they seem happy
enough now. But...does anyone know what company
owns the rights to the 4x4 cube?

These positions "look" very symmetric, especially #2, but I have not yet
examined their symmetry characteristics in detail.  They are certainly not
Q-transitive.  I do not know if either position has been reported before,
has a name, etc.  The corners are identical between the two positions, but
the edges are a good bit different.  I find both positions to be very
pretty.

This confirms a common (european?) prejudice about the U.S. and their
tendency to file lawsuits over just about anything.
I feel certain Rubik himself would have nothing against Byrden's
online cube. On the other hand it's good to know his business is well
taken care of...
Don't know about the 4x4x4 copyright, but it's pretty well known Rubik
did not design the actual mechanism for it. Ideal just used his name
to market the puzzle.

By the way, I did visit the www.Byrden.com site some time ago and really
liked it, not the least the "special octahedron".

Fine.  Please restore your web site, but say:

"Please enjoy these puzzles yourself.  However, we
cannot honor the famous Dr. Rubik because his lawyers
won't let us honor him."

>I was engaging in "unfair competition"

It doesn't matter if you take money or not.  I thought it
didn't hurt if you had advertisements honoring Dr. Rubik,
but ...

Well, I guess everyone had better remove Rubik's signature
from our instances of his merchandise, because whenever we
play with one of his products, we're advertising his name
illegally.  [Note:  This is the only sarcastic sentence
in this message.  Please take the rest seriously.]

It is true that none of their mechanism is involved.
Therefore I believe their patent doesn't apply.  That is,
if they actually still have a pattent, after Ishige and
some American who preceded all of them (whose name I've
forgotten) ...  but wait, it's been more than 20 years
(or 17 in the US), so ALL their patents have expired.

So don't honor Dr. Rubik.  Please restore all of your
mathematical puzzles.

This latter seems totally outrageous to me.  If I were in your shoes, I
would consider contacting the EFF to see if they were interested in making
a case out of this.  The request that you remove Rubik's name from your
site is the kind of petty stupidity we're seeing all to often these days,
and is probably pretty mundane to the cyberlawyers at EFF, but the notion
that they can torpedo your software if it merely duplicates the user
interface (the "look-and-feel") of their physical puzzle might be something
genuinely new.  Heck, do these guys claim that they own the underlying
mathematical group?

It ocurred to me that because these positions are strong local maxima (and
the shortest ones, at that), maybe I should show maneuvers of length 9f
ending with each of the 18 possible face turns.  Here they are.  No
uniqueness is claimed for the maneuvers.

[Apologies for taking this even farther off topic.  But in an attempt to
clear up one point...]

Indeed it's quite possible that Rubik knows nothing about it.

The issue here is the legal concept of "Laches", which says --effectively--
that if it can be shown that you, the copyright owner, did not pursue all
incidents of copyright infringement of which you were aware, then the
copyrighted item is in real danger of being declared as in the public
domain.

(This is also what's behind those silly stories of, say, some vet in the
wilds outside Buccolia, Maine with a picture of Snoopy painted on his barn
who one day gets a letter from Charles Schulz's lawyers requesting that he
either remove the picture or else sign a license arrangement at a zillion
dollars a year.)

So, in short, a copyright owner is legally "required" to go after _any_
known or perceived abuse of the copyright or face the very real danger of
losing it.

They have to say stuff like this to demonstrate that they've protected
their trademark.  Apparently the word "Rubik", when applied to puzzles,
is trademarked.  In US law, if one doesn't protect a trademark by this
manner, one may lose it.

Of course, since Rubik is also the name of a person, you should be able to
use "Rubik" when referring to the person.  The specific thing they're
worried about is phrases like "The Rubik Page" or "Rubik Puzzles."
Change the wording to "Puzzles based on those invented by Erno Rubik,"
and I don't think they can touch you.

This is bunk.  No one can trademark that stuff.  At most, there's a patent
(which you can't have violated).  The lawyers are just asking for extra.

Probably (I'm not totally certain) it was Udo Krell, an inventor whose
design was used by Uwe Meffert to make the 5x5x5.

What about Karl Hornell's Java Applet "Rubik Unbound"?? It's
all over the internet on hundreds of sites including my
own!!

I don't think the name Rubik itself can expire since that
is his name... so the name of the product is always
"Rubik's Cube"... ummmm right? :-)

I don't think you can prevent people from making java applets and the
like of cubes... but I think they (the lawyers that be) can protect
Rubik's name. I don't think anyone can say "Don't show a rubik's
cube-like construction on your web page".

The other guy who history has forgotten was Larry Nichols who made
a 2x2x2 cube called twizzle which routinely came apart and was
rejected by Ideal Toy!

I'd restore the 3x3x3 java applet if it was my web page.

Maybe i was a little fast to state that it is "generally known Rubik did
not design the 4x4x4 mechanism". I've also digged through the entire list
archives as well as my own stuff, and have found nothing which directly
indicated that Rubik DID design it. Now the earliest mention of 4x4x4 is in
Hofstadter's article in S.A. from march '81, page 26. Quote: "Rest assured,
it's being developed in the Netherlands, and it may be ready soon..."

Don't you think it would be known that Udo Krell also invented the 4x4x4 if
this was indeed the case?
All of this is getting a little vague, it could be nice to have this matter
cleared up by someone who has some REAL info! Maybe someone who worked for
Ideal at the time.

I worked for Ideal at the time...   but only as a 16 year old kid
demonstrating the cube and giving away free T-Shirts and posters
in shopping malls in the Chicago area.  Sorry, I have no idea who
invented the 4x4 mechanism.  I do remember anxiously waiting
for the mail every day for a couple of weeks when they had said
they were sending me one hot off the assembly line...

Two other URL's to point the members of this list to...


First, I have perfected custom cube sticker technology!   Check out:
      http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/CustomCubes.html

If anyone has a custom cube they have been itching to make
for years...  as long as you provide the cube sans stickers and
artwork in the size and format that I need it in...  and probably
postage to send it back to you if very many people take me up
on this...   talk to me...  together we can make you the cube of
your dreams.   A word of warning:  Odz On has done an excellent
job of solving the stickers-always-falling-off problem on the
new cubes.  You will have a MUCH easier time getting the stickers
off an old cube than you will one of the new ones.  Zarf designed
a REALLY cool cube last week...  a picture of it should go up on this
page with this weeks update on Thursday.


Also, Jake has been continuing to evolve his cube art...  Check out:
      http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeInfo/

I have a window in my gameroom with 120 cubes arranged within
it...  and every couple of weeks or so Jake comes over and solves
them into some sort of a cool 36 x 30 pixel picture.  Jake and Zarf
and Andy and myself have all designed images, and we are not out
of ideas yet...  but I'm guessing Jake would take outside design
submissions if you asked him.

	Norman Diamond refers to the patents expiring.  However, Rubik
only had a Hungarian patent.  As a result, the various Rubik companies
took legal action under copyright law, and copyright lasts much
longer.
	Perhaps I should hassle Seven Towns about the use of my notation!

Subject: RE: Game designers [was Re: Rubik lawyers...]

	In my Cubic Circular 1 (Autumn 1981), I recorded that Wim
Osterholt, of the Netherlands, had made and patented a 4^3 which he
showed me.  I don't remember it and I'm not sure when he brought it to
London - perhaps Summer 1981?  I also recorded that Rainier Seitz
(product manager of Arxon which was Ideal's German agent) showed me
some German patents and applications for the 4^3 and 5^3.  In Cubic
Circular 2 (Spring 1982), I record talking with another person who had
devised a 4^3 mechanism.  In Cubic Circular 3/4 (Spring/Summer 1982),
I describe playing with examples.  However, I don't recall ever
knowing who devised the mechanism that was produced for Ideal.  It was
common knowledge that it was not Rubik's mechanism.  One may be able
to get details from the web site that Oddz On (sp??) has set up.  Tom
Kremer (of Seven Towns, who is Rubik's agent) is supervising this site
and he would be one of the most likely people to know.  I have a huge
file of material comprising all US puzzle patents and I'll look there,
but I think I would have known about the patent for the 4^3 already.

The reason #2 "looks" so symmetric is that it is an isoglyph.  That is,
each face contains only two colors and the pattern of colors is the same
on all six faces.  If I am reading Dan Hoey's glyph table correctly, the
glyph is of type 20.  The glyph looks like the following, and the glyph
itself is fairly symmetric.

  XOX
  OXO
  OOO

On a lark, I asked Herbert Kociemba's Cube Explorer 1.5 program to find
all isoglyphs which can be built with this glyph.  Any such isoglyph is
likely to be pretty.  Up to symmetry, it found four isoglyphs (one of
which is #2, which is a strong local maximum in the face turn metric).
The other three are as follows:

F2 U2 L' R  D2 F2 L' R                       8f
F2 U2 B2 L2 U' B2 U' B2 L2 D2 L2 U  R2 U'   14f
U' L2 D' L2 D  B2 F2 L2 R2 D  F2 U' F2 U'   14f

Cube Explorer 1.5 was able to show that the 8f maneuver is minimal.
This position is not a strong local maximum, because the shortest strong
local maxima are 9f.

Cube Explorer 1.5 was not able to show that the 14f maneuvers are
minimal in the time I gave it (six hours each on a Pentium 166).  But I
suspect that 14f is in fact minimal.  Also, I do not know if the 14f
maneuvers are strong local maxima because my search for strong local
maxima extended only through 9f from Start.

I have heard through multi-generation, unreliable sources that the Cube
was first invented and patented by a Taiwanese person.  This story
strikes me as strongly false, but perhaps may have some basis 
somewhere.  Any guesses?  Perhaps a particularly different sort of
mechanism was patented?  A trademark?

Subject: RE: Taiwanese Invention of the Cube?

	The earliest idea was due to someone in California, named
William O.  Gustafson (US patent 3,081,089 of 12 Mar 1963).  He had a
2^3 in the shape of a sphere, but he had the problem of keeping the
interior parts in synch with the outer parts and so he left gaps
between the pieces.  Basically he had an interior sphere with grooves
and the pieces had lips.  There are two versions - the first seems
like it wouldn't work well, if at all, but the second seems fairly
feasible.
	Unfortunately, Gustafson let his patent lapse, so the patent
of Larry Nichols was the next, with US patent 3,655,201 (applied 4 Mar
1970, issued 11 Apr 1972).  This had only the idea of a cubical puzzle
and no practical mechanism, so I don't consider it very significant,
but Nichols sued Rubik, more or less successfully - I never heard the
conclusion of the story.
	Frank Fox (UK patent 1,344,259, applied for on 9 Apr 1970 and
issued on 16 Jan 1974) seems to be next.  He had a 3^3 sphere with
tongue and grooves holding the pieces together, with a hollow center.
He had let his patent lapse also.
	In 1976-1980, Terutoshi Ishige devised and patented two
mechanisms for a 2^3., similar to Rubik's.  This may be the source of
the story you were asking about.
	However, there is another odd story.  The first French writers
on the Cube record that a old friend said he had played with such a
cube (in wood) in Istanbul in 1920 and in Marseilles about 1935.
However, no further evidence of such an early version has appeared.
	I forgot to set this to send myself a copy.  Could you forward
it back to me.  Also you might like to send it to
cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu

Invention is more or less possible.  Surely someone like the famous
Mr. Wu (whose given names I've forgotten) would be able to invent it.
But if it happened, surely it would be hard to say who came first.

As for patenting, somehow the mixture of "patent" and "Taiwan" in the
same sentence strikes me as an oxymoron.

>A trademark?

Somehow the mixture of "trademark" and "Taiwan" strikes me as an
oxymoron too, even though they're not in the same sentence.
Want to try "copyright" next?  :-)

Is it possible to copyright the Cube?  That's why I didn't try it.

In any case, stop sneering -- Taiwan has local copyright, trademark,
and patent laws, and has had them for decades.  Sure, they haven't
honored international copyright laws, but then again, most
other countries don't think Taiwan exists as an independent
country.  When it became economically viable to honor international
copyright, they did so -- such legislation was passed in 1994.

Perhaps you are getting a biased view from living in Japan?
