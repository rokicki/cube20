Some puzzle designers do copyright their designs.

When one compares patents with copyrights, copyright makes sense.
Patents are intended for inventions that improve the quality of life
and will become important in industry after the patents expire, so
that the inventors starve.  Copyrights are for frivolous entertainment
like puzzles and photos, so they bring royalties for the lifetime of
the creator plus 50 years to the heirs.  One can only wonder why
patents were ever granted for puzzles.

Guess which part of that I was sneering at.

The Republic of China also thinks Taiwan doesn't exist as an independent

Tom and other cube-lovers,

I have completed a solution to the Rubik Tesseract and have included it in

prime time just yet.

I was wondering if there was anyone who would be kind enough to review the
documentation and see if the write-up of the solution is reasonably
intelligible and provide me some feedback before I make it and the program
generally available. It is an HTML document (332K self-extracting-archive)

Is there anyone who knows some good techniques for blindfold cube-solving?

I can solve the cube in about 7 "peeks" or so, but that's still quite
a ways from looking at the cube once and solving it behind one's back.

I believe that solving the cube blindfolded in one shot is very difficult
if not impossible. One could memorize the orientation of all cubies and
their permutation. Then use algorithms for turning the cubes without
moving them, and then algorithms for permuting them. One would need to
define orintation of cubies on the cube and then the permutation
algorithms would have to preserve that orientation. This system would
presume one really long "peek" and excellent memory, of course :)

Using my system (http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif), I could probably
bring down the number of peeks to four with some practice ... Of course,
seven is no sweat.

I have heard of something like "cubes for the blind". Probably either
have a different textured material attached to each cubie face, or a
Braille glyph embossed into each cubie face.

(Never tried to solve one blind, but I could probably solve on in about
a dozen or so glances. But for a while I worked on solving them with
my feet, after seeing someone do it on TV.)

  Wei-Hwa Huang should consider his problem "memory solving" rather

  1981).  There are also several mentions of tactile cubes in the

This brings back fond memories of the trip to CA for the first National
Cube contest back in '81...  us nine finalists were taken on a day trip to
Disney Land and we had a race to see who could solve the cube the fastest
in the line to space mountain.  As the line winds inside the building,
it is really quite dark, and we were on our hands and knees trying to
get whatever light we could from the running lights on the floor.

I don't remember who won...  but it was a huge amount of fun.

I have seen that in the World-campionship it was legal to look at

did it take from puting it back on the table (after looking) and the

Back when i was still in college, myself and a friend would occasionally
perform our "geek party trick", which was that we would sit on the floor, 
back-to-back, and someone would toss one of us a scrambled cube. Whoever 
caught it would look at it, make a single quarter-turn on it, and pass it 
over their shoulder to the other person, who would look at it and make another
quarter turn, pass it back, and so on. We could solve it in this fashion in 
just under 2 minutes.

        In my Cubic Circular 1 (Autumn 1981), I recorded that Wim
        Osterholt, of the Netherlands, had made and patented a 4^3
        which he showed me.  I don't remember it and I'm not sure when
        he brought it to London - perhaps Summer 1981? I also recorded
        that Rainier Seitz (product manager of Arxon which was Ideal's
        German agent) showed me some German patents and applications
        for the 4^3 and 5^3.  In Cubic Circular 2 (Spring 1982), I
        record talking with another person who had devised a 4^3
        mechanism.  In Cubic Circular 3/4 (Spring/Summer 1982), I
        describe playing with examples.  However, I don't recall ever
        knowing who devised the mechanism that was produced for Ideal.

        It was common knowledge that it was not Rubik's mechanism 

I have just come across Ideal's patent for its 4^3. It is US Patent No
4,421,311.  The inventor was Peter Sebesteny, and the original application
was made in Germany on 8 Feb 1981, so it may have been one of the patents
David Singmaster was shown.  It can be viewed at the IBM patent site from 

        http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?patent_number=4421311

One of the references cited by the US Patent Examiner was to page 29 of
David Singmaster's "Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube" - undoubtedly the remark
"One can imagine the 4x4x4 cube or the 3x3x3x3 hypercube.  The first might
be makeable but its group seems to be much more complicated.  The second is
unmakeable, but its group structure may be determinable."

The corresponding European patent application was taken through to the
point where it was ready for grant, but then allowed to lapse.  The next
stage would have been quite expensive and have required Ideal to translate
the specification into the languages of the European countries in which it
was to be in force.  And the US was not renewed when the first renewal fees
became due in 1986.  Presumably by then Ideal had lost interest in the
patent - they may have calculated there was zero chance of anyone launching
an imitation, given the number of 4^3s that had been left unsold.

I don't have ready access to information about the German application, but
I suspect it was applied for by Sebesteny on his own behalf, and he then
interested Ideal in it.

I used the term "blindfold solving" patterned after "blindfold chess",
where two players merely recite moves to each other, using no actual
pieces or board.  

As far as "solving in the dark" goes, it reminds me that I have a cube
in which under certain lamps, the yellow and white colors are 
indistinguishable.  Solving such a cube can occasionally give a few 
trip-ups!

I have had the same problem with orange and red, especially on my 2x2x2.
I have a "latter day" 2x2x2 (my kids lost my first one), and the colors
in general do not seem quite true to the colors on my 3x3x3 and 4x4x4
cubes.

To my knowledge, the 5x5x5 was invented by Udo Krell. It was produced by
Uwe Meffert in 1983. I read somewhere that Dr. Chr. Bandelow had the Hong
Kong factory finish extra puzzles from previously manufactured parts around
1990, don't know if this is true. Bandelow is still selling this puzzle,
under the name "Giant Magic Cube". It also seems Meffert reissued the 5x5x5
one or two years ago, under the name "Professor's Cube". This new version
might have other colors than the original. I have seen the puzzle under the
name "Ultimate Cube" several times, the name "Master Revenge" however is
new to me.
Since Meffert is the manufacturer, the "most" official name for the 5x5x5
is probably "Professor's Cube".

Isidro,

Who invented 5^3?

At least I did. In 1982 I designed and built a 5^3 cube, all in plywood.
Although I did not aplly for a patent or other registration, as I was only a
schoolboy by then, the local newspaper recorded this event. As the wooden
prototype was not as speedy as necessary, I later designed a simulator for
the Sinclair ZX Spectrum (a then so called 'personal computer' with an
amazing 48K RAM memory). This simulator also included a 6^3 cube. 7^3 was
not possible as this did not fit in the screen, which was my parents
television set. Oh, those were the days!

Nowadays I am an architect.

Kind regards,

Sytse de Maat

P.S. If you happen to know other designers of 5^3, please mail me.

[ Moderator's note: Can you describe the design that held the plywood
  model together while allowing it to turn? ]

hello cube-lovers

For all of you that haven't been into Jiri's home page at 
http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif, you should realy look into it!
Bouth the method and presentation is of very high standard!
I bought myself a system in 1982 but I was so dissapointed that I
trow it In the garbage just after.  With the system I bought in 1982 
it was not possible to make it faster than 2-3 minutes.  With Jiri's
system it should be possible in about 17 sec.!

PS: Question to Jiri.  How far are you able to do the foreplanning
the 15 sec.  before the time start to run?  Hopefully longer than
"Place the four edges from the first layer"?

Yes, you are right - with my system AND a lot of time on your hands :) I
am pretty sure that the systems of other top speed cubists are at
least as as good as mine. The system is only half of the secret.

Nope. 15 seconds is not a long time to plan more than the four edges. Of
course, as you proceed, you will usually be able to spot the corners with
their appropriate cubies from the second layer in some nice position and
continue without delays ...

I bought my first 5^3 from a department store in Japan in 1985, while it
was alongside the 3^3 and 4^3 on the mass market.  Bought my second one
from Dr. Bandelow some time later.  In Japan it was called "Professor Cube"
which could be taken as "Professor's Cube" because it would be a bit too
awkward to pedantically insert the syllable for possessive form (in
Japanese grammar) between two polysyllabic foreign words.

(Tangential details:
pu-ro-fue-so-ru kyu-u-bu is 5 + 3 syllables, while
pu-ro-fue-so-ru no kyu-u-bu would be 5 + 1 + 3 syllables.)

The magic dodecahedron reached the mass market around 1989 or so.

Those were the days.  Some time around 1993, the mass market shifted to
computer games.

Hi, I just found and joined this list.

So I am looking for any and all oddball cube variations I can find.
Does anyone have anything to sell or trade.  I can trade for a "Magic
Dodecahedron" which is the start shaped Hungarian version of the
Megaminx and I might be willing to part with a 5x5x5 cube for anything
really interesting.  I'm looking for an original Tomy Megaminx.  Also
the octahedron puzzle which is like two Pyraminx's glued together
(there might be an official name).  I am also searching for a 4x4x4
but I know they are really hard to find these days (mostly because
they tend to break).

The Dodecahedron puzzle is really amazing.  It was actually harder
than the 5x5x5 cube.  IT took me about 3 hours to work it out!  I
think once you know the 3x3x3 then all the same moves do similar
things and you can easily solve 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 with variations.  Of
course there are some cool things you can do with these.

I must say that I was disappointed with one web page that listed a
bunch of moves for the 3x3x3 cube.  I was trying some of them out and
thinking, my god, how did anyone figure this out, only to then
discover that a computer had figured them out.  OK, that's certainly
an interesting problem, but I have much more fun discovering them on
my own.  Interstingly enough, solving the dodecahedron led me to some
neat new moves for the original cube!

So where can we go from here? Have we made all the regular polyhedra
into puzzles?  Is there hope of actually building 6x6x6 and beyond
cubes?  Is there really any point to doing it?  I suppose they would
allow for some nice patterns. Does anyone know of any puzzles that are
not in George Helm's collection?  I just bought a Magic Cube puzzle at
Walgreens for $3.  It's a 3x3x3 with psychedelic stickers on it...

Ah, yes, the orange stickers on the 5X ....    ;-)


Anyway, don't they have sticker sets in any colors other than in the
standard cube-pallette?  Black or grey come to mind.  Not quite the
optimal solution, of course, but it would still give you a useable cube.

(The cool bit about letters, of course, is that on the 5X5 face in
question, you could, say, put almost all the letters of the alphabet --or
some other personalized message(s) of your choice-- and give yourself a

Dan Hoey introduced glyphs and isoglyphs on 5 August 1997.  A glyph is a
cube face containing no more than two colors, and an isoglyph is a cube
position where every face contains the same glyph.  Isoglyphs tend to be
very striking and pretty patterns. 

Each corner and edge facelet of a glyph can be the same or a different
color than the center facelet, so there are 2^8 or 256 possible glyphs. 
Dan reported that there are 51 glyphs unique up to symmetry (70 if chiral
pairs are distinguished). 

On 8 August 1997, Herbert Kociemba reported that there are 35 continuous
isoglyphs unique up to symmetry (including Start).  A continuous isoglyph
is one for which each glyph matches the neighboring glyph along the edge.
Herbert did not include the non-continuous glyphs because there are so
many, and because non-continuous glyphs are sometimes not so striking and
pretty as the continuous glyphs. 

On 9 August, Dan Hoey classified Herbert's isoglyphs according the their
respective glyphs, and provided the usual name for the isoglyphs where a
usual name existed.  Where a usual name did not exist, Dan provided a
reasonable name based on the names of closely related isoglyphs. 

On 27 August, Mike Reid gave minimal maneuvers for all the continuous
isoglyphs in both the quarter-turn and face-turn metrics. 

I have now calculated all the isoglyphs, using Herbert's Cube Explorer 1.5
program.  All I really did was to put each of the 51 glyphs into the
program in turn.  I can only guess, but this has to be more or less what
Herbert did to obtain his results.  The only difference is that I asked
the program to calculate both continuous and non-continuous isoglyphs, so
the task was a bit bigger.  My report is much in the spirit of Herbert's
original report.  I have made no effort to calculate minimal maneuvers,
nor have I made any attempt to associate names with the maneuvers. 

However, my report does include all the glyphs along with their associated
isoglyphs.  In fact, for each glyph I have included the entire equivalence
class of glyphs under the rotations and reflections of the square (either
1, 2, 4, or 8 glyphs in each equivalence class).  There is, of course, no
necessary relationship between the number of glyphs in the equivalence
class and the number of isoglyphs.  You only need to put one glyph from
the equivalence class into Cube Explorer 1.5 to create the isoglyph, and
any one glyph from the equivalence class will do as well as any other.

I can report that of the 51 glyphs unique up to symmetry, 8 of them
produce only continuous isoglyphs, 17 of them produce only non-continuous
isoglyphs, 14 of them produce both continuous and non-continuous
isoglyphs, and 12 of them produce no isoglyphs. 

In addition to confirming Herbert's figure of 35 continuous isoglyphs, I
can report that there are 249 non-continuous isoglyphs.  In the category
of "most isoglyphs", one glyph has 2 continuous and 49 non-continuous
isoglyphs, and another has 4 continuous and 46 non-continuous isoglyphs. 

The only other thing that probably requires explanation about the chart
that follows is that there is a two character code below each glyph.  This
is a hexadecimal representation of a binary number based on the following
pattern,

  765
  4X3
  210

where the number includes 2^k if facelet k is the same color as the center
facelet.  This is not intended as a new classification to replace Dan's. 
It is just a bookkeeping technique I used (a 16x16 matrix) to keep track
of the 256 glyphs.

I have found some adhesive backed vinyl sheets at a local Art Emporium but
they are mostly irridescent shades and you have to cut the pieces to size
yourself. I seem to recall that there was an orange color but I'm not sure.

Subject: Eclipse and Pyramorphix

There are two new puzzles out,
by the two most prominent veterans respectively:

 1) Rubik's Eclipse, which is some sort of two-player game and,
    according to the people who have it, a real gem.
 2) Pyramorphix, by Meffert.
    David Byrden's Twisty Puzzles page shows a picture of
    a 2x2x2 Pyraminx together with the text
    "A solid version of this amazing puzzle is now available
    from Uwe Meffert, called the Pyramorphix".
    Now the 2x2x2 pyraminx looks like an old east german puzzle,
    which was a 2x2x2 cube in tetrahedral shape. The shape changed
    when the puzzle was scrambled, so the name Pyramorphix would
    apply. However the east german puzzle was not by Meffert.

Now if anyone knows more about these new puzzles,
or where to get them, please reply.

Hello, I am a fond of the cube of Rubik, but in my country it is very 
difficult to get it.  
She/he would want to know if you can give me information about where I 
can get the cube and their different variants.  
For the information that you can to give, I thank him a lot.

Subject: All the Partial Isoglyphs
To: Cube-Lovers <cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu>
Message-Id: <Pine.PMDF.3.95.980329181553.328319A-100000@PSTCC6.PSTCC.CC.TN.US>

I have been able to calculate all the partial isoglyphs a little more
quickly than expected.  I can report that there are 10 continuous partial
isoglyphs and 130 non-continuous partial isoglyphs, unique up to symmetry.

Here is a breakdown of how the solid faces can be arranged.

      97 - two solid faces, opposite to each other
      11 - two solid faces, adjacent to each other
      25 - one solid face
       1 - three solid faces, mutually adjacent to each other
       2 - three solid faces, not mutually adjacent to each other
       3 - four solid faces, other two opposite to each other
       1 - four solid faces, other two adjacent to each other
     ---
     140

The partial isoglyphs are all included in the chart which follows.  If
nothing is listed with respect to the manner in which the solid faces are
arranged, then there are two solid faces opposite to each other.
Otherwise, the arrangement of the solid faces is listed explicitly.

This chart follows the same format as the previous one I posted for all
the isoglyphs, except that this time I included only a single
representative glyph for each partial isoglyph, rather than the complete
equivalence class of glyphs.

Really??  I found the Dodecahedron significantly easier than the 4x4x4.
The Dodecahedron gives more "space" for moves...

As this table shows, the vast majority of partial isoglyphs involve two
solid faces opposite to each other.  The basic reason for this is the
corners.  If the corners are not fixed, then the only partial isoglyphs
which are possible have two solid faces opposite to each other.
Conversely, the 43 partial isoglyphs which do not have two solid faces
opposite to each other do fix the corners.

In fact, 67 of the partial isoglyphs derive from just 5 of the glyphs,
namely those which fix the corners.  If the corners of the partial
isoglyph are fixed, you can think of the edges as consisting of a set of
strongly constrained edge flips and swaps.  (Be careful -- if the corners
are fixed, then *any* resultant position can be thought of as just a bunch
of edge flips and swaps.  But for partial isoglyphs, the possible edge
flips and swaps are strongly constrained.)

The glyph which yields the most partial isoglyphs is the one my charts
call BF, whick looks like the following.

X0X
XXX
XXX

With this glyph, each face of a partial isoglyph can have at most one edge
cubie which is swapped or flipped, but on a cube-wide basis there are
quite a few different ways to arrange for this to happen.

Another interesting glyph which fixes the corners is called BD on my
charts, and which appears as follows.

X0X
XXX
X0X

As an isoglyph, this glyph yields five different patterns on the 6-H
theme.  As a partial isoglyph, this glyph yields a number of pretty 2-H,
3-H, 4-H, and 5-H patterns.  You may also think of the H patterns as
complicated edge swappers/flippers, with exactly zero or two edges
swapped/flipped on each face, and with the coloring requirements for
partial isoglyphs being maintained.

The following two glyphs (A7 and AF in my charts) are in the same spirit
as the H, except that the configuration of the edges on each face which
are swapped/flipped is slightly different than for the H.

X0X X0X
0X0 0XX
XXX XXX

Finally, for completeness in the list of glyphs which fix the corners, the
glyph called A5 on my charts appears as follows.

X0X
0X0
X0X

However, this glyph only yields two partial isoglyphs.

Note that all the glyph types which Mike lists (01, 02, 0D, 04, and 03 in
Dan's taxonomy) fix the corners.  Thus, his note below points out that in
order to have anything other than two solid faces opposite to each other,
you must fix the corners.

The correspondence between Dan's taxonomy and my charts is 01=BF, 02=AF,
03=A7, 04=A5, and 0D=BD.  As I said earlier, the identfication numbers on
my charts are not a taxonomy.  Rather, they provide a unique
identification for each of the 2^8 glyphs.

This possibility does occur in my chart.

Indeed!

All three possibilities do occur in my chart.  In addition, I found three
partial isoglyphs of type 03 with one solid face.

After looking at a lot of isoglyphs and partial isoglyphs in the last
little while, I wonder if it's not the case that some of the
non-continuous isoglyphs are prettier than some of the continuous ones,
and that some of the partial isoglyphs are prettier than some of the
isoglyphs?

Continuous isoglyphs do *in general* seem prettier than non-continuous
ones, and isoglyphs do *in general* seem prettier than partial isoglyphs.
But consider the following two (counter?) examples.

The glyph

   000
   XXX
   000

yields (among other things) L2 F2 L2 R2 F2 R2, which is a non-continuous
partial isoglyph.  It looks about as follows (quite pretty and striking,
in my opinion):

      XXX
      XXX
      XXX

  0X0 0X0 0X0 0X0
  0X0 0X0 0X0 0X0
  0X0 0X0 0X0 0X0

      XXX
      XXX
      XXX



On the other hand,

   U B2 R2 F2 L2 U L2 F2 U2 R' B' R F' L' U2 B2 R2 B' D' U'

is a real mess in my opinion, even though it is a continuous isoglyph. It
looks something like the following.

      X00
      0X0
      XXX

  XOX XXX X00 00X
  XX0 0X0 0X0 0XX
  X00 00X XXX X0X

      00X
      0XX
      X0X


Notice that the partial isoglyph which was my first example "looks" fairly
continuous, even though it really isn't.  The reason it looks that way is
that it is continuous along all the edges where the non-solid glyphs come
together.  Call such a non-continuous partial isoglyph quasi-continuous.
I think your eye tends to ignore the solid faces anyway, so that a
quasi-continuous partial isoglyph tends to be very striking and very
pretty.  For example, there are a number of 4-H and 4-T patterns among the
partial isoglyphs which are quasi-continuous and which are very pretty.

I think this (the pattern, not the operator to produce it) is actually
rather striking and pretty - provided you look at the cube along the
URB-LDF corner-to-corner axis.

Subject: A workable 6x6x6 cube design (probably)
Message-Id: <19980408.075506.7150.0.tenie1@juno.com>
From: tenie1@juno.com (Tenie Remmel)

I have found that the 6x6x6 cube can only be made practical if the
outer rows of cubies are slightly larger (about 3mm or 1/8 inch).
If the rows are all the same size then some cross-sections of pieces
(e.g. the corner pieces) are less than 3 sq-mm, and other pieces are
extremely thin (0.6mm in some places).

If the plastic is black (or white) and the stickers are all the same
size then the inequality in the size of the cubies will be effectively
masked.  The stickers would have to be spaced evenly.  The cube will
look as if it has a small 'border' but the perception will be that the
cubies are the same size.

This design is actually almost as strong as the 4x4x4 cube.  It contains
an internal frame plus 256 movable pieces of ten different types.  No
cross section of a piece is smaller than 7 sq-mm (the 4x4x4 has center
pieces with 9 sq-mm cross section).  Two of the types of piece
(FACE EDGE PIECE, SPACER PIECE 2) come in two mirror image forms, so the
number of molds that would be needed to produce this is 14 (counting two
for the internal frame).  The internal mechanism would need to be greased
to allow it to turn smoothly, but it should be no worse than the 5x5x5.

The following is an exact geometric description of each piece.  To be
able to understand this you need to know how to use Cartesian and Polar
coordinates.  All pieces are intersections of planes, spheres, and
hyperboloids (which can probably be approximated as cones).

The SPACER PIECE 2 could probably be replaced by some sort of rectangular
but rounded blob-like thing, it does not need to be an exact shape and
the cube might turn more smoothly if it is rounded.  It also might then
be possible to make it symmetrical so they could be produced with a
single mold, which would slightly reduce production cost.

Comments, suggestions and quibbles are welcome.



LEGEND - x,y,z are Cartesian coordinates, r is distance from origin
         Dx, Dy, Dz is distance from x, y, z axis respectively

NO TOLERANCES - pieces must be shrunk away from all sides a little bit

DIMENSIONS assume that the size of an inner CUBIE is 100 and the size of
an outer CUBIE is 125, this allows the pieces to be much stronger than if
the cubies were all the same size.  The puzzle occupies the space such
that
-325<x<325, -325<y<325, -325<z<325.

Maximum vertical play needed (i.e. strain in the radial direction, mostly
on the inside) is about 12 units, or 1.5 mm on a 78mm cube.  If all parts
are designed with a tolerance of 2 units (0.24 mm) (e.g. by shrinking
each
part 1 unit (0.12 mm) away from all sides) then the maximum vertical play
needed is about 8 units (1.0 mm).  Extra space could be provided (shrink
inner face of frame away from center by another couple of units), if this
is too much.

So who gets to try and make one?  I understood that the dies for the
5x5x5 cube are too expensive to build now due to "lack of interest".  On
the other hand, we should try to build one because we can.  If we can
that is :)

Subject: Hamiltonian circuits on the cube

	The discussion of isoglyphs, etc., has reminded me of a problem which I
worked on in the early 1980s but never resolved.  I took an all white cube and
traced a Hamitonian circuit through all the 54 facelets.  If you jumble this
up, it is essentially impossible to restore.  Indeed there are probably many
solutions to the problem.  This led me to ask some questions about such
Hamiltonian circuits through the 54 facelets.
	A.  How many are there?
	B.  Are there any such circuits where the pattern is the same on each
face?  I thought I could prove that such did not exist, but I think I assumed
that the circuit entered and left each face once, but this need not be the
case.
	I was able to find a circuit with two types of face pattern and the two
types were mirror images.  If you index the facelets on a face by  11, 12, ...,
33,  then the path on the face is:  11, 12, 22, 21, 31, 32, 33, 23, 13.
	If the circuit enters and leaves each face just once, then the sequence
of faces visited forms a Hamiltonian circuit on the faces of the cube, which is
better viewed as the vertices of an octahedron.  It is easy to see that there
are just two such circuits on the octahedron (up to isomorphism).  One of these
circuits has two kinds of vertex behavior and hence is not suitable.
	Does this question interest anyone?  The reason for the second question
was that if just one type of face pattern could be used, then it would be easy
to print up stickers for sale - one would just do the same pattern six times!

This is quite reminiscent of "Oddmaze,"
(http://www.edoc.com/zarf/custom-cubes.html) which is a creation by Andrew
Plotkin realized using Kristin Looney's "Custom Cube Technology"
(http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/Technology.html).

On its surface is a labyrinth with no branches or dead ends.  Each
facelet has exactly two paths through it.  In the "start" position, at
least, the path obeys the Celtic knotwork property (over/under
alternations).  It is really quite interesting, and well described on the
above mentioned page.

(This doesn't help answer your questions, but might put you in contact
with another that has given them some thought.)

 Am I missing something? The geometrical description seemed plausible
and fine, but unless I'm far off base, it seems that some quite-clever
mechanical design is essential. Fairly sure that Douglas Hofstadter
noted in passing (I think in Go"del (G"odel ? :), Escher, Bach...) that
a physical prototype of the 6^3 has been built.

 I have pulled apart and studied all "sizes" from the 2^3 to the 5^3,
and the innards of each are rather different; the 5 is based on the 3,
but the 4 (Rubik's Revenge) has a ball inside, as probably most List
readers know. The innards of the 2 are quite distinctive, again; (also,
borderline impossible to assemble/disassemble!). It's remarkable how a
simple increment of one, so to speak, has such a profound effect on the
basic internal design.

 My awareness of most abstruse corners of math. is quite comparable with
that of, let's say, a turtle. However, I do know modest bits about
formal kinematics, four-bar linkages, and some underlying principles of
the linkage variety of mechanical analog computers, for instance, so my
ignorance is somewhat better that that of a rock. I also know the
innards of mechanical calculators rather well.

 However, with such non-qualifications, I suspect that there is no
theory of such mechanisms as we find inside our cubes and related
puzzles. Mathematicians seem to be able to handle braids (Emil Artin?)
rather well, and knots seem to be doing well, but I really doubt that
there's any significant theory that can be used to develop a design such
as the innards of a 5^3.

 Ordinary geometry, I feel fairly confident, is of relatively little
help. One can at least define the geometry of the requisite constraints
and "freedoms" of motion, but to create the requisite shapes, seems to
me, requires a special and clever kind of mind.

 Honestly, I'd welcome having big holes figuratively shot through my
contentions! I'm sure I'd learn something.

 For limited (and probably very costly) prototype runs, the technology
that goes by various names such as 3-D printing, rapid prototyping, and
(ugh!) stereolithography should do well to create the shapes. (Seems to
me it's a fairly formidable challenge to a CAD program to create some
of the weird shapes, but I plead ignorance!

 (The "stereo" part of that long word is fine, but it's really
stretching a point to think of it as writing on stone.)

Does anyone know if the dies still exist? I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if the whole set weighs several tons, even if they are single-cavity
types. Tooling for injection molding is fiercely expensive! (Tooling for
a decent ("serious") plastic soprano recorder runs probably a third to a
half $US million, for instance. (Mostly bigger parts, a few very
critical tolerances, and far fewer parts, also.))

visible in a different unfolding:

It shouldn't be that hard to solve a cube with these markings--there
are only two different kinds of corner cubies, three kinds of edge
cubies, and the face centers need only be oriented mod 180 degrees.
Working from one of the symmetric corners, it's not hard to see that
this is the only continuous solution.

I've noticed a minor modification to your pattern that also admits an
isoglyphic Hamiltonian path:

Not to minimize the difficulty of the problem or the beauty of the
solution (quite the contrary), but the solution seems almost trivial
when viewed in the light of Dan's particular unfolding of the surface of
the cube.  The same comment is true of Dan's isoglyphic solution.

It makes me wonder of you actually saw Dan's unfolding in your mind's
eye, as it were, as you worked out your solution.  Or another way to put
it, did you work out your solution in 2-D or in 3-D?  It also makes me
wonder if there is any other unfolding that would lead as naturally to a
Hamiltonian circuit.  I tend to think not, but I could well be wrong.

Actually, I didn't visualize any unfolding at all, so I guess I
did it in 3-D.  Here's approximately the line of reasoning that
led to my solution.

As Dr. Singmaster notes, there is only one way to draw a Hamiltonian on
a 1x1x1 cube where all the faces are identical, and that is with a right
angle on each face.  Naturally one's first impulse is to find a path that
enters each 3x3 face in one place and exits in another -- and these two
ends must be on edges 90-degree apart.  One quickly sees that the two exits
must be on edge cubies, since if any were on corner cubies there would
be a parity problem between "inner corners" and "outer corners."  But if
they were edge cubies, then no Hamiltonian path exists (as the inner corner
must join to the ends already).

However, another extension is the "three parallel paths" pattern:  put this
on each face:

 A  B  C
 |  |  |
 |  |  +-D
 |  +----E
 +-------F
This leads to three paths on the cube, where the center one is the
traditional 1x1x1 Hamiltonian.  If this can be rearranged to a solution,
we must try to reconnect the ends so that there is some "interaction"
between the three paths.  C must connect to D, but we can connect A to B
instead -- and this leads to a solution, which surprised me when I
visualized it on a 3-d cube.  (I most definitely find visualizing in
3-D easier than visualizing the links in an unfolded cube.)

I actually generated all the continuous chiral isopaths, and the
following is the other extreme--the only one with nine disjoint paths.
Yet one of the paths goes through one third of the facelets.

Which was bogus.  I actually generated only the continuous chiral
isopaths in which no circuit lies entirely on one face.  That's fine
for the Hamiltonian circuit problem, but for the maximum number of
disjoint circuits we probably want the 14-circuit pattern

Subject: "Rubik's Revenge" - 4x4x4

Dale,

Thank you for your inquiry.  We do have a limited number of "Rubik's
Revenge" parts for those of you who have a broken cube: 

         ITC-030a 4x4x4 Center Cubie - Ideal Toy Co. $ 2.50 each 
         ITC-030b 4x4x4 Ball Center - Ideal Toy Co.  $10.00 each 
         ITC-030c 4x4x4 Corner Cubie - Ideal Toy Co. $ 2.00 each 
         ITC-030d 4x4x4 Edge Cubie - Ideal Toy Co.   $ 2.00 each 
         ITC-030e 4x4x4 Sticker - Ideal Toy Co.      $  .50 each

You want 1 corner and 2 centers?  You will reuse your stickers?  How will
you pay?  Postage will probably be $2.00. 

Recently the price of a "Rubik's Revenge" has hit as high as $200.00 each
on the "Web". Can you believe that! The last five we sold, fortunately for
our customers, went for $65.00 each. How would you like to see it back in
the market for less than $30.00? Possibly even less than $25.00. Would you
buy more than one?  For us to bring it back we have to place a minimum
order of between 10,000 to 30,000 pieces and pay for new tooling - all up
front. Tell your friends and have them tell their friends, and their
friend's friends to get on our wish list. Have your local puzzle retailer
contact us as well. By using the power of the "Internet", e-mail, and word
of mouth I'm sure we can get the numbers up there and make this happen in
less than a year. I'm ready and willing are you? 

In the meantime, we also carry as standard stock the Rubik's 2x2x2 for
$5.99, Rubik's 3x3x3 for $10.99, 3x3x3 Magic Cube for $6.99, 5x5x5 for
$38.99, Square 1 for $14.99, and Skewb for $32. 

We also pull in on a fairly regular basis Megaminx, Impossiball, Pyraminx,
Mickey's Challenge, Masterballs, and various other sequential movement
puzzles when we can. Prices and quantities vary, but we're always on the
hunt.

We'd very much like to bring the 4x4x4 back to market. You can help
greatly by spreading the word. 

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Mike D. Green 
President

Ok, I'm back into cubing again... a few interesting, if somewhat
disjoint observations:

Summary of the 3 different types of optimal superflip sequences:

1)  Superflip with minimal q turns & symmetric moves
    Process has central reflection symmetry
    R3 U2 B1 L3 F1 U3 B1 D1 F1 U1 D3 L1 D2 F3 R1 B3 D1 F3 U3 B3 D3 U1
    (24q, 22f)

2)  Superflip with minimal q turns & asymmetric moves
    U1 R2 F3 R1 D3 L1 B3 R1 U3 R1 U3 D1 F3 U1 F3 U3 D3 B1 L3 F3 B3 D3 L3
    (24q, 23f)

3)  Superflip with minimal f turns & asymmetric moves
    U1 R2 F1 B1 R1 B2 R1 U2 L1 B2 R1 U3 D3 R2 F1 D2 B2 U2 R3 L1
    (28q, 20f)

------------------------------------------------------------------

No matter which cube you start searching from, e.g. pons asinorum,
12 flip, or any random cube, the dispersion of cubes is the same:

1, 12, 114, 1068, 10011... etc

So much for trying to search backwards from the 12-flip to number
the positions from (perhaps) antipode to start!

------------------------------------------------------------------

 I have got Mike Reid's optimal solver to work under the dos shell
in windows 95. I finally managed to compile it using WATCOM 11.0
thusly:

     wcl386 /k10000000 search.c

 I had to give it a 10 megabyte stack for it to work!

 It found the sequence ( F R B L )^5 to require 20 q turns, so there
is nothing better. Next I tried ( F R B L )^6 to see if that would
be 24 q but a 20 q solution was found. Mike Reid confirmed the
result on another computer running Linux.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, some non-mathematical ideas on how to do optimal searches
of rubik's cube patterns. Using my own human solving algorithm
I solve the 4 down edge cubes last. One of the patterns I
get was solved optimally by Mike's program thusly:

D' R' D' F B' D' L' D L D F' B D R

If we assign a value of 1 to each face and add them we get:

D = 6  U = 0
F = 2  B = 2
L = 2  R = 2

Note that most of the action occurs with the D face, which I find
suggestive. After all, nothing is moved except the 4 bottom edge cubes.
Also all the other faces have an even number of turns!
My idea is perhaps with some pre-processing of a goal state it is
possible to prune the number of moves down to such a degree that
the number of moves actually tried is quite small. Also note that
this particular goal state has only 2 pairs of cubes swapped, and
all the other cubes are in place.

Now I may be using too much hindsight, but to me it is counter-
intuitive that it is possible to have 3 separate turns of the
D face! So, sequences with 3 uses of the D face should not be
considered. My theory is that ultimately with enough pre-processing
only the optimal sequences will be even considered!

This has been discussed before on Cube-Lovers.  There are several ways
to look at why it is true.  I think at the most basic level that it
depends on the inverse property of groups.  Let A be any non-empty
subset (not necessarily a subgroup) of G, and let x be any element of G.
Then xA contains the same number of elements as A.  Hence, if A is (for
example) the set of all positions which are n moves from Start, then xA
is the set of all positions which are n moves from x, and xA is the same
size as A (remember that the distance from Start to a is the same as the
distance from x to xa for any a in A).

Notice that if A is a subgroup of G rather than just being a subset,
then xA is a coset. The fact that cosets are either equal or disjoint,
combined with the fact that A is the same size as xA, constitute the
basis for the proof that the size of a subgroup must divide evenly the
size of the group.

The inverse property is involved in showing that A and xA are the same
size as follows. Suppose we have A={a,b,c} which contains three
elements.  Then we have xA={xa,xb,xc} which also appears to contain
three elements.  The only way that xA would not have three elements
would be if some of the apparently distinct elements were really the
same, for example if xa and xc were really two different names for the
same element.  But if xa=xc, then we have x'(xa)=x'(xc) so that
(x'x)a=(x'x)c so that ia=ic so that a=c.  We know by definition that a
and c are distinct.  Hence, xa and xc must be distinct.

Just to give one more illustration of the importance of the inverse
property in showing that A and xA are the same size, here is a false
counterexample.  Consider the multiplicative group of the real numbers
or of the rational numbers.  Suppose A={ 2/3, 3/4, 7} and x=4.  Then,
xA={ 8/3, 3, 28}.  So far, so good because both A and xA have three
elements.  But suppose x=0.  Then xA={0, 0, 0}={0} which has only one
element. Here we have A with three elements and xA with only one
element.  So what is wrong.  The problem is that any multiplicative
group of what we might call "normal"  numbers (e.g., real or rational or
complex) must omit zero because 0 does not have a multiplicative
inverse.  That is, there is no solution to the equation 0*x=1. So when I
let x=0, I was cheating by multiplying by a number which is not in the
multiplicative group and which does not have a multiplicative inverse.

The reason I know that this has been discussed before was that I was
involved in the discussion.  At one point I incorrectly asserted that
what you are calling "the dispersion of the cubes" did depend on which
position was at the root of the search.  Cube-Lovers was quick to
correct me, of course.  However egregious was my error, it was still an
honest error.  The reason for the honest error is that I accomplish
nearly all my searches by counting patterns (M-conjugacy classes) rather
than by counting positions.  And when you count by patterns, "the
dispersion of the cubes" does depend upon which pattern is at the root
of the search.  So my mistake was to make a statement about positions
which should have been applied only to patterns.

Your note reminded me of a question I have thought about off and on ever
since that previous discussion.  Suppose you are searching by patterns.
Under what circumstances can you start the search with two different
patterns and still have the "dispersion of the cubes" be the same?  I
suspect that there is a very simple answer, but I am having trouble
ascertaining what it is.  I suspect that the only possibility is if the
two positions differ by superflip, that is if one of them is x then the
other one must be xf=fx, where f is the superflip.  But I am simply not
sure if there are any more possibilities.  Note that having the two
different patterns be M-conjugate is not an answer to the question
because if two patterns are M-conjugate then they are really just one
pattern.

As a last comment, readers of Cube-Lovers should be familiar with the
sequence 1, 12, 114... for positions in quarter turn searches.  A search
for patterns in quarter turns begins 1, 1, 5...  The first 1 is Start.
The second 1 (1q from Start) is Q, the set of twelve quarter turns.  The
5 (2q from Start) represents the following five patterns: 1) any face
twisted twice in the same direction, 2) any two opposite faces twisted
once each in the same direction (an antislice), 3) any two opposite
faces twisted once each in the opposite direction (a slice), 4) any two
adjacent faces twisted once each in the same direction (e.g., UF or
U'F'), and 5) any two adjacent faces twisted once each in the opposite
direction (e.g., UF' or U'F).  Beyond 2q from Start, it becomes too
complicated to calculate the patterns in my head.

We may call this the "pseudosquare" group P.  It consists of
orientation-preserving permutations that operate separately on the
three equatorial quadruples of edge cubies and the two tetrahedra of
corner cubies, and for which the total permutation parity is even.  So
Size(P) = 4!^5 / 2 = 3981312.

> L' R U2 L R' may be an example.

No, that's in the square group, says GAP.  Also, Mark Longridge
noticed (8 Aug 1993) that the square group is mapped to itself under
conjugation by an antislice (though I don't recall a proof--is there
an easy one?).  Your position is (L R)' R2 T2 R2 (L R), so this result
would apply.  Does anyone have a square process for it?

> If square moves are applied to such patterns to form new groups, how

Consider the subgroup of P consisting of positions in which the
parity of the corner permutation is even.  (The edge permutation will
then also be even, and the parity of the permutations of the two edge
tetrahedrons will be equal).  Call it AP, for "alternating P".
Size(AP) = Size(P)/2 = 1990656.

The square group S is a subgroup of index 3 in AP, so
Size(S)=Size(AP)/3=663552.  I don't have a very criterion for choosing
elements of AP to be in S, except that it has to do with a correlation
between the permutations of the two tetrahedrons of corners, provided
those permutations are of the same parity (as they must be for the
position to be in AP).

According to GAP, these are the only three possibilities.  To be
explicit, let us label the cube's corners

  1 D   B 3
  C 2   4 A

Then we can partition S4 into six cosets:

    C1 = { (),      (3,4)(1,2), (1,4)(2,3), (2,4)(1,3) }
    C3 = { (1,2,3), (1,4,2),    (1,3,4),    (2,4,3)    }
    C2 = { (1,3,2), (1,4,3),    (2,3,4),    (1,2,4)    }
    C4 = { (1,2),   (1,4,2,3),  (1,3,2,4),  (3,4)      }
    C5 = { (2,3),   (1,4),      (1,3,4,2),  (1,2,4,3)  }
    C6 = { (1,3),   (2,4),      (1,4,3,2),  (1,2,3,4)  }

and similarly D1,D2,...,D4 for S4 acting on {A,B,C,D}.  Now let c be
an arbitrary permutation in P that fixes {A,B,C,D} elementwise, and
let Coset(c) be the coset to which c's operation on {1,2,3,4} belongs.
Let d be an arbitrary permutation in P that fixes {1,2,3,4}
elementwise, and let Coset(d) be the coset to which d's operation on
{A,B,C,D} belongs.  Then the group generated by <S, c*d> depends only
on Coset(c) and Coset(d):

     Coset(d)
             D1 D2 D3   D4 D5 D6
Coset(c)
        C1    S AP AP    P  P  P
        C2   AP  S AP    P  P  P
        C3   AP AP  S    P  P  P

        C4    P  P  P    S AP AP
        C5    P  P  P   AP  S AP
        C6    P  P  P   AP AP  S

There may be some wisdom to be gained in seeing that C1 is normal in
S4, so S4/C1 is isomorphic to S3.  We can represent the Ci and Di by
their action on {1,2,3,A,B,C}.  The above table shows whether the
group <Coset(c)*Coset(d), C1*D1, C2*D2, C3*D3, C4*D4, C5*D5, C6*D6>,
has order 6, 18, or 24.

I'd love to hear a more explanatory description of this phenomenon,
especially if it explains the absence of a subgroup of index 3 in P.

I almost forgot about all that info back in 1993!

But I hardly think a proof is necessary. After the moves (L' R) all the
following moves are in the square's group. Then we are just doing
the inverse of (L` R) at the end. Not very rigourous, but...

I'll search for a counter-example.

I should really have waited until I got back home to Singmaster's
book, which has a marvelous explanation of why the squares group has
index 6 in the pseudosquare group.

First, the edges are permuted in in all possible ways consistent with
    1. remaining in their "equators" of four edges,
    2. not being flipped, and
    3. having a permutation parity equal to that of the corners.
so we need only consider the 2x2x2 cube, and then we fix the BLD
corner in place.  Corners don't get twisted, so we consider only the
permutation.

We express the generators as permutations of the seven movable
corners, expressed as follows:

            2-------A
           /       / \

           \       \ /
            4-------C

The neat part is to notice that the permutation on {A,B,C} is
determined by the permutation on {1,2,3,4}.  We do this by
representing these generators as symmetries on a tetrahedron, labelled
as follows.

            1-----------C-----------2
             \`-.               .-'/
              \  `A.         .B'  /
               \    `-.   .-'    /
                \      `4'      /
                 \      :      /
                  B     :     A
                   \    :    /
                    \   C   /
                     \  :  /
                      \ : /
                       \:/
                        3

Notice that the symmetry that permutes the tetrahedron's vertex labels
as (1,4) also permutes the edge labels as (B,C), corresponding to F^2
in the cube's action.  Similarly (1,3) implies (A,C) and (1,2) implies
(A,B).

With respect to Mark Longridge's having noticed that the square group
is mapped to itself under conjugation by an antislice (L R), the proof
turns out to be pretty easy.  First, we notice that we may consider
conjugation by a slice (L R') since that differs by a square (R^2)
from the antislice.  Now we work in the group that includes whole-cube
orientations, and perform the slice in the mechanically easy way, as a
4-cycle of face centers and an equatorial 4-cycle of edges.  Note that
all the edges of the equator are flipped (with respect to the
orientation that is preserved by the psueudo-square and square groups)
by the slice.

So if S is a square-group process that rotates the edges in an equator
E, the process

     Slice' S Slice S'

has the following actions:

1. Identity on the corners and the two equators other than E,
   because they are not moved by the slice,
2. Identity on the face centers, because they are not moved by S,
3. Flips each edge of E twice (once in Slice' and once in Slice), so
   restores the orientation, and
4. Is an even permutation of the edges in E (odd in Slice, odd in
   Slice', and equal in S and S').

The even permutation (4) of the edges in E is a slice group process,
as Mark noted, as for instance the 3-cycle (R^2 F^2 R^2 T^2)^2 F^2.

the set of such patterns is what i called the "target subgroup" for my
optimal solver.  it is the intersection of the three subgroups
<U, D, F2, R2, B2, L2>,  <F, B, U2, R2, D2, L2>  and  <R, L, F2, U2, B2, D2>
(or the intersection of any two of them).

the position he mentions is in the square group (mark longridge gives
a minimal maneuver for it).  dan hoey remarks that the square group has
index 6 in this "pseudo-square" group.  christoph bandelow's book
"inside rubik's cube and beyond" gives a nice criterion for a pseudo-
square pattern to be in the square group.

bandelow's criterion (slightly paraphrased) is

     the four  U  corners must be coplanar, the four  F  corners
     must be coplanar, and the four  R  corners must be coplanar.
     (equivalently, all twelve sets of four coplanar corners
     remain coplanar.)

in fact, this forces the parity of the corner permutation to be
even (and thus the same for the edge permutation).

this reminds me of an interesting idea i had for a puzzle: a 3x4x5 box,
whose faces and slices are restricted to 180 degree turns.  this sort
of thing could also be done with any dimensions.

Since we all know that Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4) puzzles are nearly impossible
to find (all of mine have long ago broken) and the 5x5x5 cubes fall apart so
easily that they are basically unusable.

Well, as a solution to this, I took a Virtual Cube simulation and added
sizing buttons (the cube program supports 2x2x2 to 5x5x5 sized cubes), a
keyboard interface, and allowed it to receive sequences in standard UDFBLR
notation.  I also added locking of the center pieces to make using a paired
up Revenge easier.

The cube is located at http://www.mud.ca/cube/cube.html.  Any thoughts,
comments, suggestions about the program should be sent to:
mailto://noel@mud.ca.

You are right about the 4x4x4 availability. I have, however,
never had any problems with my 5x5x5 cube. Actually the 5x5x5
mechanism is quite ingenious. I never heard of any broken one.
The only problem i can think of is the orange sticker tendency
fall off.

I suggest people with 5x5x5 that tend to fall apart try and fasten the
small screw underneath the center caps. This might help, at least it did
on mine. Mine didn't fall apart though, it just got loose, and sometimes
the pieces between the corners and the centres would sort of make a
wrong twist. After i tightened the screws that problem disappeared.

Subject: Solving a 4 Dimensional Rubik's type Cube

Announcing a web page at
http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/solution.html which gives the
explicit steps to solve a challenge configuration for a 2x2x2x2 (that's
four dimensions) Rubik type cube.

The challenge configuration is available at
http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/Nteract4.html.
These pages do NOT require a Java enabled browser however, they do
require Netscape 4.0 or Microsoft Explorer 4.0.

This note is to solicit your judgments regarding the difficulty of the 4
Dimensional Rubik with no edge cubes (2x2x2x2.)  I believe it is
relatively easy, provided only that the simulation provides for the
cyclic permutation move, (NE-->SW, SW-->NW, NW--->NE)

Background:
Posted on rec.puzzles dl April 21, 1998:

A four dimensional articulated cube is on the web at
http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/4cube.html

The result of marrying a Rubik's cube with a tesseract, this cube is
2x2x2x2. It has 16 corners and 24 faces.  It does not have edge cubes
and the corners have no orientation requirement.  Only 4 colors are
used. The solution space is thus roughly equivalent to that of a 3x3x3
Rubik if not smaller.  It is rendered in Javascript and will run on
Netscape 3.0 and 4.0

This posting caused about 25 hits to the page, but got no follow-up
dialog on the rec.puzzles news dl.

Note that in this first version, the corners are only identified by
color, not by correct position.

I wrote the page without having a clue as to how to solve it.  In the
process of just testing code I discovered that it is remarkably
unchallenging, once you get a sense of which corners the various
buttons rotate. (Flipping a glove from left-handed to right-handed can
be done in 4-space, but is impossible in 3-space.)  I may not be an
unprejudiced solver, but I would rate the challenge only slightly
harder than a 15 square slider puzzle. To increase the level of
difficulty, a second version of the puzzle was developed.  In this
version, the solution requires that the corners are returned to their
correct location.  They still do not requires 4-space orientation.
This version was announced in the following posting.

A Four dimensional Rubik's Cube with solution.
At http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/Nteract4.html

Re-designed to allow importing of 3D Rubik methods, this version uses
(a slightly extended version of)  standard Rubik cube naming of moves
and positions, has a shortcut button for one of the common permutation
moves and a scramble button to provide a challenge position.
I rate the challenge as equivalent to solving two faces of a 3D Rubik
cube.  I am looking forward to your comments, opinions,  and
suggestions.  I am especially interested in positions which cannot be
solved  or cannot be solved without extensive permutation moves other
than the one included.

This page has received about 50 hits.  But again, there was no
responding dialog on rec.puzzles news dl.

The difficulty of the second version is higher, but I rated the
challenge as equivalent to solving two layers of a 3x3x3 cube. The only
obstacle, an ordinary solver might face,  is finding the longish
sequence required to permutate 3 of 4 corners.  That's why I provided
the shortcut button (which applies the actions: L'URU'R'LRUR'U' with one
click.)

Discussion:
My concern is that people assume the puzzle is really hard and not worth
the effort.  It  may be seen as somewhat like the sequences from one
time pads which would be cryptographers who post and ask if anyone can
decrypt them.  To make it clear that a solution is not that difficult, I
have now made a page which gives an explicit solution, with
illustrations of each step and even some animation at
http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/solution.html

There are obviously shorter sequences to obtain a solution, however this
one has the value of providing clear checkpoints along the way, such
that a solver can determine if they have missed a twist.

I want and would welcome your judgment about how easy or hard the puzzle
is.

The Jewel is basically an octahedron, but the vertex pieces are absent.
This does not make the puzzle easier. Apart from the jewel i also have a
taiwanese and a polish made octahedreon (with vertex pieces). A third
version exists, made by Uwe Meffert, but quite rare. The turning quality
of the jewel is very close to that of the polish made octahedron, so i
believe that is where the jewel originates (Correct me if i'm wrong,
Christoph!)
The disassembled polish octahedron has a mechanism very close to that of
the Pyraminx puzzle, also by Uwe Meffert. It is not a cube mechanism.

I just received puzzle from a fellow collector:
It is like a Magic Domino, but only about 47 mm along the long
edges. The pieces are red and white. The 9 red pieces have a
drawing of Superman and the 9 white pieces a drawing of Superwoman!
Unfortunately the puzzle was broken on arrival.
Does anyone on the list have a similar broken puzzle,
and maybe could spare a piece (edge)?

 Sorry if my memory's faulty, but I don't recall any recent mention of
the Magic Jack. This is a 3-cubed, 3-D array of 26 small cubes
constrained by an outer cage to slide past their neighbors. At first
glance, it looks like a Rubik's Cube, but immediately one realizes it's
quite different. It's about the same size. Disassembly looks impossible
unless the outer "cage" is cut. 

 As you'd expect, it's a 3^3 array, but with one position empty. It's a
3-D analog of the 15 Puzzle. The individual cubes are not connected in
any sense to their neighbors. While the moves in a 15 Puzzle are in one
plane and easily defined by amateur mathematicians, in the Magic Jack,
there are many more possible ways of moving a given cube to another
position.

 Also, not surprisingly, cube moves are strictly translational.

 The fun begins when one attempts to create patterns. Each cube has
specific surface markings. The simplest configuration creates an
exterior in which all cubes have a random, fine-grained, glittery
diffraction-grating-like surface. More complicated, and difficult, are
the colored patterns, which when solved, create (iirc) a continuous path
around the whole puzzle. There are three, I'm fairly sure; one creates a
message. Solving is made more difficult by the fact that most cube
faces are obscured by their neighbors.

 As to its intrinsic mathematical difficulty, I'm not close to being
well informed/educated enough to judge. The practical problem of hidden
faces does add to the practical difficulty, and the number of "degrees"
of freedom for a given cube (from 3 to 6, depending on position)
certainly increases the available choices.

 I saw this puzzle at Games People Play in Cambridge; it's a German
import. Quality of construction was good, although there was no
detenting, and it could be easier to move the cubes. It might actually
be easier to constrain potential interferers, and let gravity do the
work. The difficulty was essentially caused by other cubes' getting out
of position, not poor quality. Price in the store is $25.

 Not sure whether they're interested in mail orders, but it might be
worth a try. While I have no connections with G.P.P., perhaps it
wouldn't be out of order to give some info.:

 Afaik, they had possibly as many as a dozen in stock.

 G.P.P. also periodically imports 5^3s from Germany, perhaps not from
Dr. Bandelow. They have a nice collection of movable-piece puzzles.

Check your local puzzle outlet first -- Magic Jack may be pretty widely
available.  When I was in the hospital last summer, my father brought one
of these with him when he came to vist me from Philadelphia.  I don't
recall the name of the store there where he purchased it.

I still haven't solved it.  The first step would clearly be to just catalog
the 26 different cubies, but I haven't even done that...

check out
http://members.aol.com/islandcom/
for information about the Vadasz Cube which is a variation of the Magic
Jack described above. I have a "3x3x3 Classic Cube Solid" and have been
able to solve it.
The Vadasz Cube allows you to easily disassemble it, if desired. Also, each
of the 26 cubies can be disassembled and reconfigured allowing you to
create variations of the puzzle. The cubies are made out of plastic tiles
so that you can re-arrange the construction and colors of each of the 26
cubies if you desire.

Five different puzzles are available:
2x2x2
3x3x3
4x4x4
and
multi 3x3x3
multi 4x4x4

Two comments on the Magic Jack:

Apart from Magic Jack and Vadasz Cube, there also exists a german
produced puzzle called "IQUBE". Like the Magic Jack, this is a 3x3x3
sliding puzzle with 26 smaller cubes. Cubes have colours red, green and
yellow, and it is possible to arrange them so the entire surface is
either red or green. Yellow is possible with red or green centres. IQUBE
comes with a leaflet that suggests a total 12 different solution
possibilities. The puzzle is suitable for the blind, since the three
different colours also feel differently. I bought mine from Spielkiste
 (http://www.twfg.de/puzzle/default.htm).

A 2x2x2 sliding puzzle is mentioned in "Rubik's Cubic Compendium", in
the part that is written by David Singmaster (quote):
"The only such (three dimensional moving-piece puzzle) puzzle that i
know of is a sliding cube puzzle of Piet Hein which is so rare that both
Rubik and I recently re-invented it before learning that it had been
done by Hein."
There is also an illustration which shows a 2x2x2 sliding cube puzzle
similar to the small Vadasz Cube.

Some years ago (around 1989?) I made a computer search on this kind of
puzzle.

The idea was "is there a way of colouring the 27 cubies (and then remove
one) so that a 3x3x3 cube can be arranged (with sliding block moves) to
show all external sides of either of three colours".

Since a 3x3x3 cube shows 9x6=54 cubie sides at one time, and 27 cubies have
in all 27x6=54x3 cubie sides all "cubie sides" would be used in one
configuration each.

So - I hunted for the answers to:
1) Is such a colouring possible?
2) Which cubie would be nicest to remove?

My search showed that 1) was indeed possible, and that there is one
distinct way for the colouring (not counting reflections etc) and 2) It is
possible to choose a cubie to remove so that the space will be positioned
in one of the space diagonals for each of the three solutions.

If anyone is interested I can dig out the specific colouring.

A new version of Charlie Dickman's Rubik Tesseract program and its
accompanying documentation is now available from http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/
(under the heading of "Neat 4D stuff I wish I wrote" :) ).
This latest version contains a general solution to unscramble an
arbitrarily scrambled Rubik Tesseract as well as some improved bells and

the Macintosh program.

All mail about the Tesseract docs and program should be addressed to

I bought one of these from Games People Play and it is unsolvable on one
of the colors.  At least, getting the piping to wander all the way
around on the red colors was not possible.  It looks like one of the
stickers is oriented incorrectly.  I told the folks at FunTech and they
told me to send it back to them and they would look.  Also, when I
solved the message version I couldn't get the rest of it to line up.
Some of the pipes on the other edges didn't line up and it wasn't
possible to make the rest silver.  This was kind of disappointing.

Dear cube lovers,

a few days ago I have subscribed to the list. I have downloaded all
the archives and also found some software (great stuff).

Some of you may know my name from Mr. Bandelow's book - I'm the guy
who won a prize with the shortest maneuver fro the super-flip-twist.

I always thought the cube is dead. Now I am really surprised to see
this completely wrong :) The level of discussion is really amazing.

I have are some questions concerning terminology:

What does M-conjugacy mean (this doesn't seem to be a standard term
from group theory).
[ Moderator's note: See "Symmetry and Local Maxima", 14 December 1980.
  This also introduces the group M and some of its subgroups, which
  are helpful in a lot of the cube-lovers discussion.  Jerry Bryan
  also tried an explanation of M-conjugacy on 3 October 1996.  ]

Some mails in the archives mention numbers like p102 for patterns ?!?!?
[ M: I believe Mark Longwood uses numbers of that form to catalogue
  patterns. ]

Does anybody know the current upper bound for God's algorithm (in q/f
metric).
[ M: 29 face turns, 42 quarter turns.  The best known lower bounds are
  20 face turns, or 24 quarter turns (both achieved by superflip).
  This was true on 13 February 1996, and I don't think there has been
  an advance since then. ]

Is there any serious research on the 4*4*4 or 5*5*5 cube. Computer
search is probably beyond available/affordable hardware :(

Are there any maneuver search programs that can handle slice metric ?
I think that slice metric makes sense since q and f metric have no
natural extension for "higher" cubes.
[ M: See 1 June 1983 for "Eccentric Slabism", a genereralization of
  the q metric that could be adapted to a f metric. ]

Does anybody have some nice patterns on the 4^3 or 5^3 cube ?
[ M: I reported some 4^3 patterns on 15 June 1982.  Have there been
  others?  Any 5^3 patterns? ]

I think I have some in my old (and thick) cube folder (paper,  not on
my PC :))
[ M: Could you type some in? ]

Some of these questions probably have been discussed already. Sorry, I
haven't read ALL old mails.
[ M: Note that I left quite a few of these questions unanswered--other
  replies are welcome, either pointers to archive messages I forgot or
  new answers.  But this highlights a major failing of the archives:
  We don't have a FAQ, or even an index to the major articles.  Is
  anyone interested in working on something like this?  I have very
  little time for it just now. ]

I made a chess board out of four 5^3 cubes, which you can check out along
with our other cube sculptures on www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeArt.  If
anyone has any good pattern ideas for four 5^3 cubes, I'd like to hear
them, particularly before I peel off the stickers on one of them and give
it a color pattern similar to Colorspace created by Andy Plotkin (which you
can see at www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/CustomCubes.html).

Maybe you find the following pattern for the 4*4*4 interesting (I'm not
sure I am using the proper notation, but by Capital letters I mean side
moves, small letters are slice moves):

R r U2 u2 R2 r2 U3 u3
F3 L D2 L3 D3 F2 U2 F2 D L D2 L3 F
L3 F U2 F3 U3 L2 D2 L2 U F U2 F3 L
D F2 B2 D2 F2 B2 D

The last three lines alone make a similar pattern on a 3*3*3 cube. I have a
shorter sequense for it somewhere that I can't remember by head. One can
also make a similar pattern on the 5*5*5, I'll try and dig it out...

Subject: New Puzzle: "Dogic"

I just received a new Puzzle called "Dogic - Test Your Logic".
It's in the shape of an Icosahedron, and moves in the following manner: 5
triangles can rotate around their common vertex somewhat like the Impossiball.
Each triangle is again subdivided into 4 smaller triangles which move
separately, i.e. one can also rotate 5 smaller triangles around the same
vertex. Thus there are 60 "vertex" triangles and 20 "middle" triangles, the
latter are in fact equivalent to the Impossiball. The "vertex" triangles
are unicolored, the "middle" triangles have three colours. The whole Puzzle
has twelve colours, one for each vertex.

  I count the number of distinguishable positions:

  20! 3^19 60!
  ------------  =  2,199110779324 x 10^82
   2 5!^12 60

I'm not sure these calculations are correct, but if they are, this Puzzle
is at the very top of Mark Longridge's "Great Cosmic Ranking List", even
above the good old 5x5x5 Cube!
The Puzzle is very well "Made In Hungary". A true must for anyone who likes
cube-type Puzzles. Available from Spielkiste/Germany, check out:

From: "Michael C. Masonjones" <mcmj@blazetech.com>

I apologize that I don't have more information, since I am away from the
stuff that I bought and I can't look at the packaging.

I was in Toy Works in W. Springfield, MA, and was very surprised to find a
series of puzzles I believe are newly available in the US after a long
hiatus.  The puzzles are Pyraminx, Skewb, and Meffert's Ball (with the four
colored rings arranged on a spherical Skewb device.  I think only the Skewb
was called by its real name.  All were in the same basic packaging, looked
pretty authentic, and I think they all had Meffert patent/copyright info on
them (at least the ball did).  And they were all marked down from $10 to $6.
Not bad at all.

There must be more out there, but my nearest KayBee didn't have anything.
I'm not sure if Toy Works is a big chain or not.  It seems to be from the
stuff they carry and the size of the store.

Happy hunting.

This run took about three weeks on a Pentium 300.  The next level from
Start is going to be difficult.  With the current algorithm and
hardware, it would take about thirty to forty weeks.  In addition, the
memory requirements will go up considerably.  Currently, I store only
the positions up to five moves from Start in memory.  To calculate the
next level, I will have to store the positions up to six moves from
Start.

I still suggest (see "How Big is Big?" in the archives) that the problem
can be calculated all the way to the bitter end, eventually.  The Cube
problem simply is not as big as, for example, Chess or Go.

As a possible strategy, if we could add one level per decade, we could
probably calculate the problem all the way to the end within about 100
years. Moore's Law (the power of computers doubles about every eighteen
months) suggests that such a schedule might be possible.

This method is called Zarf's Linearization: For any exponential-time
problem, just wait the linear amount of time for the current generation
of computation to make it possible to solve your instance in one hour,
then solve your instance in one hour.

Subject: patterns on 5x5x5 cube

a while ago, rainer asked for patterns on the 5x5x5 cube.  here
are some i know (the hardest part seems to be finding the scraps
of paper on which the maneuvers are written).

standard notation uses  R  and  r  for 90 degree clockwise
twists of the outer layer and second layer, respectively.  i've
found it convenient to have notation for  Rr , so i use  _R_
(that is, capital R underlined).  i guess this notation is more
convenient for handwritten maneuvers, but not so convenient for
e-mail.  i'll use  _R_  to denote  R  underlined and

        _( F L U B ... )_

to mean that the whole thing inside the parentheses is underlined.

the first pattern is a "double" snake; it meanders onto each face twice.

_R'_  b'  _U_  F2  _U'_  b  _U_  F2  _(U' R2 F')_  u2  _(F U L')_
u2  _(L U' R' L)_  f  _D'_  B2  _D_  f'  _D'_  B2  _(D L2 B)_  d2
_(B' D' R)_  d2  _(R' D L)_

if i understand the terminology correctly, this is a continuous
non-chiral isoglyph with the pattern

     ...*.
     **.**
     .*...
     .*...
     .*...

i still remember that when i found this pattern some 10-12 years
ago, i saw the URF faces together.  then i turned the cube around,
and was surprised by how it continued on the other three faces.
(i shouldn't have been surprised, but you know how that goes ... )

i came across this pattern accidently.  then i went snake hunting,
and found several others:

snake 2
_(R F2 R2 U2)_  r2  _(U2 R2 F2 R' D' F2 B2 D R F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(U2 R2 F2 R' D')_  r2  _(F2 B2)_  L2  _(R2 U' D F2 B2 U)_

those two have the property that the two snake segments on each face
have the same color.  if this condition is relaxed, we also have

snake 3
_(R L' F U2 R F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(D2 L2 F B' D' F B' U' D F R L D' B2 L' F B' D')_
f2  _(U2 D2)_  f2  _(U' D2)_

this one can be modified slightly; change the U and D faces

        .*.*.        .*.*.
        .*.*.        .***.
        .*.*.        .....
from    .*.*.   to   .***.
        .*.*.        .*.*.

if only one is changed, then we get two separate snakes.

there's also

snake 4
_(D F2 B2)_  l2  _(F2 B2 R')_  R2  _(F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(U2 R2 F2 R' D' F2 B2 D R F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(U' D' F' U2 D2 B U' D L2 B2 L' U2 D F2 B2)_


another interesting pattern is

U R' U' F'  _U'_  R'  _U_  f  _U'_  R  _(U F')_  F2 U R U'
_B_  l'  _D2_  l  _D_  f'  _D2_  f  _(D' B')_
D' L D B  _D_  L  _D'_  b'  _D_  L'  _(D' B)_  B2 D' L' D
_F'_  r  _U2_  r'  _U'_  b  _U2_  b'  _(U F)_

which gives a continuous non-chiral isoglyph with the pattern

     .*...
     .*...
     .*...
     *****
     ...*.

the same maneuver produces an analogous pattern on the 4x4x4 cube,
but there's probably an easier maneuver.  another isoglyph (also
continuous and non-chiral) with the same pattern is

R  f'  U2  f  U  l'  U2  l  U' R'  _D'_
L  b2  L'  _B'_  U  b2  U'  _(B D)_
L'  b  D2  b'  D'  r  D2  r'  D L  _U_
R'  f2  R  _F_  D'  f2  D  _(F' U')_

modifying this pattern is how i found the first double snake.

Thanks for the patterns,

the problem is - my 5*5*5 cube is scrambled and I have to figure out
how to unscramble it. I haven't touched it for 15 years.

I also have several hundred pages of hand-written stuff.

I have several 4*4*4 patterns. I wonder if enough people on the mailing
list have a (La)TeX system so that I can post the patterns in LaTeX
format.

Concerning this I need feedback !!

By the way, my last 4*4*4 cube starts to fall apart. Does anybody know
if it is still available ?

PS

Does anybody else have patterns for the 4 or 5 cube ?

If so, pls. send them to me. I will create a document in ps and/or pdf
format about

Subject: 4*4*4 patterns
From: Rainer.adS.BERA_GmbH@t-online.de (Rainer aus dem Spring)

Dear cube lovers,

as promised the other day here comes my collection of 4*4*4 patterns.
My favorites are the single twisted rings. I still find it surprising
to see that there is no second ring on the "other" side.

The maneuvers use all sorts of slice moves which are probably not
accepted as moves by most cubeologists. I am too lazy to rewrite them.

Does anybody have any idea which format I should post for people
without a TeX system?
Plain ASCII is not really what one needs to display cube maneuvers.

I can offer Mathematica notebook, postscript, WINWORD (arrrrgh)and
(perhaps?) pdfd.

Does anybody know of a 4*4*4 emulator or even solver?  Anything like
a (sub)optimal solver is probably beyond the current PC powers.

Rainer

PS
I am NOT a LaTeX expert :) hints are welcome !

[Moderator's note: The notation is fairly straightforward, but may
 be new to cube-lovers.  Subscripts (encoded with underscores) show
 which 1x4x4 slabs relative to the given face are turned; omitted
 subscripts apparently mean the outer face, as "_1" would mean if it
 were used.  Exponents have their usual meanings as repetition.  The
 only advantage to running this through TeX seems to be that you get
 true superscripts and subscripts and somewhat nicer fonts.

 I've added a few commands that seem required by LaTeX.  I've also
 replaced a number of narrow spaces (coded as backslash-comma) with
 ordinary spaces, so that this is more readable as text and so that
 some of the worst long-line problems are reduced.  Perhaps some of
 these processes would be more readable if printed on multiple lines,
 or punctuated somehow.  I wonder if there could be some
 simplification with the [X,Y] = X Y X^{-1} Y^{-1} commutator notation
 or the X^Y = Y^{-1} X Y conjugate notation, or if this would make the
 processes too hard to follow. --Dan]

Although it's using your mind in a different fashion, you could
disassemble it, sort the pieces (takes a while!) and reassemble it in
the solved state. With any reasonable degree of care, you won't harm a
5^3, I'm just about sure.* Have a clean work surface. I have done it
maybe 5 or 6 times on mine (from Meffert, ca. 1987). If you have a cat,
don't even think of letting it in the same apartment or house while it's
apart! :) The insides are really quite amazing to see. The internal
"foot" that retains a corner cubie is an amazing shape.

 *A 4^3 requires much more care. The center cubies are fragile! There
was a message a while back from someone who's selling parts for 4^3s.

 To start the disassembly, align all layers (obviously), so it's a cube.
Then rotate one face, leaving the other four layers aligned. Rotate it
either less or more than 45 degrees, so that a left or right edge cubie
of the rotated face is aligned with the edge of the other four layers.
Plainly, it doesn't matter which you choose, because of physical
symmetry internally.

With the rotated face on top, pry up the left (or right) edge cubie,
away from the edge you aligned it with. Use your thumb, thumbnail facing
down. Once it disengages, the rest won't fall apart uncontrollably; a
few pieces will fall out, but most will need to be actually removed, one
by one. Study the structure as you pull it apart. Amazement is one
reason, and the other is to get a better idea of how to reassemble it.

Sort the pieces (it might take longer than you think!).

Your color references for rebuilding will obviously be the center and
corner cubies. Build one face completely, place that face down onto your
work surface, and build progressively up from there. The last cubie will
be in the same position you removed to start.

My 3-D sense happens to be extremely good (apparently hereditary), so I
had very little trouble figuring out what goes where and how. It might
be harder for some others.

Here is a bit of a follow-up.  I didn't say so explicitly,
but only the results 10f from Start were new.  The search
had been calculated through 9f from Start previously.

In some ways, there was nothing new in the program to
calculate 10f from Start vs. 9f from Start, because the
memory requirements are the same either way (all the
positions up through 5f from Start have to be stored either
way). Basically, the only difference was to let the program
run longer. A faster machine helped a great deal. Also, I
did add a simple checkpointing capability which helped a
great deal.

I received some private E-mails suggesting using the net as
a massively parallel computer to calculate the problem
further from Start, similar to what has already been done
on the net to break certain ciphers.  The checkpointing I
added to the program is a step in the direction of parallel
processing.

As has been described in the Cube-Lovers archives, the
program uses an algorithm that produces permutations in
lexicographic order.  Such an algorithm inherently
decomposes easily into parallel processing.  So by analogy
to processing a phone book or a dictionary, it should be
possible for one machine to process the A's, another
machine to process the B's, a third machine to process the
C's, etc., and then to add the results together.

(Actually, you would use finer decomposition than that.
One machine would process the AB's, another would process
the AC's, etc., or perhaps you would use even a finer
decomposition.  Note that there are no AA's because these
are permutations we are talking about -- no letter repeats
within a word.)

What is really needed are some scripts to drive and control
such a process.  I really don't have time right now  --
maybe in the future.  Also, to go past 10f from Start, the
machines working on the project would have to have a good
bit of memory, maybe something in the 100MB range would
have to be dedicated to the program to calculate 11f or 12f
from Start.

The existing program is in C.  It was suggested in a
private E-mail that writing the program in Java might make
it easier to run "on the net".  Maybe, but I am dubious at
this point if Java is ready to handle the size of problem
we are talking about.

With respect to the E-mail about waiting for faster
machines to deal with exponential problems, my real point
was not that waiting on technology is a wonderful way to
attack the Cube problem. Rather, I was suggesting that the
Cube problem is small enough, even at about 10^19, that it
can ultimately be defeated by technology (i.e., by Moore's
law). Chess is about 10^75 and Go is about 10^120.  Moore's
law is therefore pretty well bound to fail before Chess
or Go can be solved.  (Deep Blue played very good chess
against Kasparov, but not perfect chess.)

There are two strong local maxima 9f from Start, and
they have already been posted to Cube-Lovers.  Six more
strong local maxima showed up at 10f from Start.
Regrettably, my "simple checkpointing" did not include
printing out the permutations for the strong local maxima
-- I just counted them.  I have improved the checkpointing,
and am rerunning a part of the program to print out the six
strong local maxima.  So far, the only one of the six which
has been printed turns out to be a 4-H pattern.

I have found an old booklet by Endl (terrible) that contains a Mickey

Thank God - I have TWO cats :)

Yeah, mine is very flabby.

A real cube meister will never disassemble his cube :)

I have sent Rainier an html conversion of his file. With his permission
and approval I'll post on my web page

Yes. MAPLEV5 (Mathematica's main competitor) released a 4x4 Rubik's
cube emulator (as well as a masterball emulator and a 3x3 Rubik's cube
emulator) in their "share package" included with the software. The
share package is actually free but MAPLEV5 is not! Incidently, the
emulators work on some older versions of MAPLE as well. The pictured
linked to on the bottom of the above-mentioned web page were obtained
using this emulator. - David Joyner

It would be theoretically interesting, IMHO, to have the expressions
rewritten using commutators but more confusing in practice to follow.

>A real cube meister will never disassemble his cube :)


That's true but it is better than the alternative:  the dreaded _sticker
peeling_! I took a course in university called "Intro to Public Speaking".
In it we had to give a persuasive speech and mine was Called "Why you
shouldn't peel stickers of a Cube". Here are some of the reasons I gave.

1. The stickers weren't designed to be peeled. So until the people at 3M
come out with a post-it note version of the cube, then peeling will only
wear the cube out faster

2. Cheating defeats the purpose of the puzzle. It reduces it to a simple
jigsaw puzzle. But if you find this simpler puzzle challenging - an unlikely
scenario for cube-lovers - then by all means peel away.

3. Douglas R. Hofstadter once noted that there were two mysteries to the
cube: 1. How does one solve the cube and 2. How does the cube stay together.
If frustration gets the better of you and you must cheat then disassembling
the cube is the preferred way because even though it does nothing to shed
light on the first mystery it does give insight to the second mystery.
Besides disassembling the cube and reassembling it don't cause (much) damage
if you're careful.

4. Chances are greater that you'll leave the cube unsolvable. Kids in my
grade school in the 80's used to peel stickers because they were so close to
completing two sides that they resorted to peeling one or two stickers to
get the job done. This behaviour inevitably left the cube unsolvable. If you
disassemble a cube and then assemble it randomly, there is a 1 in 12 chance
that you'll be able to solve the cube. But if you take all the stickers off
a cube and restick them randomly, then you have a better chance at winning
the lotto 6/49 twice in a row on your next two tickets, than your chances
and getting a solvable cube. (I'll post my math if anyone asks)

Subject: 4x4x4 patterns
From: Rainer.adS.BERA_GmbH@t-online.de (Rainer aus dem Spring)

Dear cube-lovers,

Of course, HTML is the format I should have used. I'll try to get a
latex->html converter for NT.

Anybody my post the patterns in any format.

The R_123 means turn 3 slices - this is the same as turning L and then
turn the whole cube R.

This notation was inspired by Bandelow's usage of slice moves.  The
advantage is, it makes sense for any cube. The disadvantage is, most
cubologists don't accept these "moves".

I have checked all patterns on my (physical) 4x4x4 cube.

I don't think using conjugation and commutatotrs is very user-friendly.
The maneuvers are not optimized and anybody will be able to figure out
how they were constructed using conjugation and commutators, though.

As far as I remember the patterns were the last thing I did in those
golden cube days :)

Does anybody know of a cube simulator for Mathematica ?

I recently bought a "Meffert's Challenge" puzzle, and I see there hasn't
been discussion of this puzzle on this list.  Maybe it is new.  It is a
round Skewb, like Mickey's Challenge, but with different markings.  When
solved, it has four colored rings on it.  The triangular pieces each have
about a quarter ring on them.  Four of the square pieces have two separate
quarter ring markings, and the other two square pieces are blank (actually,
they say "Meffert's Challenge").  I think it is fun because in addition to
solving the puzzle, you can try to make different "snake" patterns on it.
It took me a while to figure out how to make a snake that uses all but one
of the segments.

I threw away the packaging, and I don't remember who makes it.  I think it
was Pressman.  I bought it at a toy store in the Supermall in Auburn, WA,
and they also had a normal Skewb made by the same company.

Subject:  "Hints" for Solving the 5X

Since you 1] posted to this list and 2] have a 5X and have solved it
the past, I'm going to make the assumption that really want is not
necessarily a cook-book for solving the 5X, but enough hints to get
you started in the right direction.

If I'm wrong about this, you can stop here.  ;-)  If not, below is
high-level description of a scheme for solving the 5X that assumes
1] that you're 3X3X3-literate and 2] leaves unspecified the details of
the three other simple operations that you'll need.

(Now, this is far from elegant; and certainly not anything like a
maximal solution.  But at least it will 1] get your cube solved and 2]
at least you thinking about these things again.)




---
Step 1:

First, ignore everything except the corner cubies, the center (face)
cubies and the center-edge cubes.

Now, paying attention to those cubies only, pretend that you're
dealing with a 3X and "solve" it.


---
Step 2: Solve the non-center edge-cubies [NCEC].

First devise an operator that allows you to cyclically-swap three of
the NCECs (i.e. without messing with any of the previously solved
cubies).  With a little clever permutation, this single operation will
allow you to complete this step (but see Step 2A below).

(Note that since a NCEC _has_ to be in its correct orientation when it
is in its corrected location --i.e. a correctly placed NCEC can't be
simply flipped as can a center-edge cubie in a 3X-- you can complete
this step using this single operation.)


Step 2A: There is one wrinkle at this point.

It is possible to be in an "orbit" in which you can apparently "solve"
all of the NCECs except for two.  If you reach this point, leave the
two unsolved NCEC alone for the moment.  They will be easier to solve
after completing the next step.


---
Step 3: Solve the remaining non-center face cubies [NCFC].

Similar to the above, devise two operators: one that allows you to
cyclically-swap three "corner-like" NCFCs and one that allows you to
cyclically-swap three "edge-like" NCFCs (i.e. without in either case
disturbing the previously-solved cubies).

Again with a little clever permutation you should be able to complete
this step with this single operation.

(Note that since, for a given color, all four "center-like" NCFCs are
pretty much interchangable --as are all four "edge-like" NCFCs.  This
means that that any "bogus" symetries are invisible.  What this means
is that, by saving this step 'til last, you don't risk getting all the
way to the and finding out you're in some non-standard "orbit" that
you have to back out of.)


---
Step 2A Continuted:

Assuming that you've got this far, you should now be in a state where
the entire cube is solved except for --at most-- two NCECs.

In short, this state of affairs means that your cube is a wrong
"orbit"; i.e. there is a "hidden" symmetry among that cubies that
allows your cube to appear to be more nearly solved than it is.

The quickest way to get your cube in the "correct orbit" is as
follows:

Choose one of the "internal" slices that contains one of non-solved
NCECs (by "internal", I mean a slice that is neither a face slice nor
one that contains a center cubie).

Now rotate that internal slice by a quarter turn (i.e. by 90 degrees)
in either direction.

Now what you want to do is solve remaining cubies from its current
situation.

The tricky part here is keeping everything straight.  There are a
couple of things that you can do help this.

1] If possible, you can first manipulation the NCECs in such a way
that the two unsolved NCEC share the same slice and are on the same
face.  Then it will be possible --when performing the quarter-turn as
described above-- to bring one of the unsolved NCEC into its correct
location.

Once that is done, you will now have exactly three unsolved
NCECs.  Since these must necessarily be a cyclic permuation, you
should be able to solve these without further ado.

Now, all that remains is solving the remaining newly scrambled
face-cubies.


2] If you are unable to position the two unsolved NCEC as described
above, proceed as follows:

>From the current state, (i.e. after performing the quarter-turn
on the internal slice) re-solve the newly shuffled face-cubies
*while*being*sure*not*to*disturb*any*other*cubies!

Once you have all the faces solved, you should now have four NCEC in
the wrong locations, along the single internal slice.  Using the
operation that you developed in Step 2 above, this should be easy to
solve.


---
Step 4:  Place your newly-solved cube in a prominent place on your
desk and assume a smug demeanor when asked about it.



Hope this helps

 yes, I just happened to buy both of these puzzles myself today.  They
 are made by Pressman.  It is interesting to note that the copyright
 says, "(copyright) 1997 Uwe Meffert patent #5,358,247" for *both*
 puzzles.  (same mechanism)
 They also are selling the Pyraminx in the same type packaging.  Is
 the Pyraminx also a Skewb mechanism?  (I didn't buy one since I
 already had one) Now I wish they would bring back some other puzzles!
 :-)

Subject: new optimal solver

lately i've been working on a new optimal solver.  this is similar
to the previous program, but uses different subgroups.  let  H
be the subgroup in which

        the four edges  FR, FL, BR  and  BL  are all in place,
        and are correctly oriented
and
        the four  U  corners are on the  U  face (and thus the
        four  D  corners are on the  D  face, and they are oriented
        so that the  U  [respectively D]  facelet is on the  U
        [respectively D]  face.

then the cosets  H \ G  are described by triples  (e, cl, ct)  where

e  describes the location and orientation of the four edges  FR, FL,
    BR  and  BL,
cl  describes the location of the four  U  corners, and
ct  describes the orientation of the eight corners.

there are

24 * 22 * 20 * 18 = 190080  different  e  coordinates,
/ 8 \
\ 4 /  =   70  different  cl  coordinates, and
3^7    = 2187  different  ct  coordinates.

all combinations are possible, so there are  190080 * 70 * 2187 =
29099347200  cosets.  the subgroup  H  has 16-fold symmetry; it is
invariant under any symmetry of the cube that preserves the  U-D
axis.  therefore the coset space  H \ G  also has this symmetry.
up to symmetry, there are  12094  e  coordinates.  thus, we can
reduce the coset space to  12094 * 70 * 2187 = 1851470460
configurations.  store each configuration in half a byte of memory
(storing its distance from start).  the whole thing can be stored
in a tiny array of 925735230 bytes, approximately 883 megabytes.

the number of cosets (actual numbers, not reduced by symmetry)
at each distance is

distance   quarter turns       face turns
 0                     1                1

i have this running on one processor of a sun ultra enterprise 450,
configured with 1024Mb of RAM.  startup time is significant: it takes
about 85 minutes for quarter turns, 125 minutes for face turns, to
exhaustively search the coset space.

some rough estimates are that it is 6.7 times faster than my previous
optimal solver for quarter turns, 3.4 times faster for face turns.
this is not nearly as good as i'd hoped.  there seems to be some
performance issue with this machine.  it appears to be significantly
slower when accessing large amounts of memory at random, despite the
fact that it is all real memory, so no swapping is occurring.  the
performance drop off starts at about 256Mb.  my program runs slower
by a factor of 3 or maybe even 4 because of this.  my sysadmin has
reproduced the same behavior on a small test program, so the problem
is unlikely to be caused by my code.  i'm told that it is probably
some gross inefficiency in the cache paging system of the operating
system (solaris).  the os seems to have plenty of options, so perhaps
one of them will fix this problem and speed up my program by a factor
of 3 or maybe 4.  it seems ridiculous to me that things work this way,
but apparently they do.

nevertheless, the program is already fast enough for the tasks at hand.

Subject: all 24q maneuvers for superflip

with my new optimal solver, i've calculated all 24q maneuvers for
superflip.  there are three transformations we can apply to a
maneuver for superflip, none of which change its length.

     we may conjugate by any cube symmetry.
     we may cyclically permute the maneuver, i.e. replace

          sequence_1 sequence_2  by  sequence_2 sequence_1

     we may invert the maneuver.

in a previous message (august 7, 1997), i showed that, using these
three transformations, any maneuver for superflip can be transformed
into one that begins with one of the ten sequences

     U  R2        U  D' R      U  D  R      U  D  R'     U  R  F
     U  R  F'     U  R' F      U  R' F'     U' R  F'     U' R' F'

my program took 101 hours to exhaustively search these ten cases.
there are four inequivalent maneuvers; two were previously known:

R' U2 B  L' F  U' B  D  F  U  D' L  D2 F' R  B' D  F' U' B' U  D'    (24q*)
U  R2 F' R  D' L  B' R  U' R  U' D  F' U  F' U' D' B  L' F' B' D' L' (24q*)

the two new ones are:

U  D' R  F  U' D' L  D' F  R  U' R  U' D' F  U' F  L  B' U  F' B' L  B' (24q*)
U  D' R  F' D  L' B  L' U' R' D' B' U' D  L' F  D' R  B' R  U  L  D  B  (24q*)

this last one can be written as

     (U  D' R  F' D  L' B  L' U' R' D' B'   R_rl)^2

where  R_rl  denotes reflection through the R-L plane.

we can also count the total number of 24q maneuvers for superflip.
note that  U2 = U U  also is  U' U' , so can be cyclically shifted
in an extra way.  similarly,  U  D' = D' U , so this also accounts
for an extra cyclic shift.  and the same is true for  U' D'.
the total number of maneuvers therefore is

28 * 24 * 2 + 28 * 48 * 2 + 28 * 48 * 2 + 26 * 24 * 2 = 7968

where the first factor is the number of cyclic shifts, the second
factor is the number of cube symmetries we can apply, and the third
factor is 2, for inversion.  the first and last maneuvers only get
a factor of 24 for the number of cube symmetries, because a cyclic
shift by 12q gives the same maneuver in a different orientation.

the total number of 24q sequences is 274575811926317204506464.
the total number of even positions is 21626001637244928000.
so even positions have an average of 12696.56 different 24q maneuvers.

Subject: superflip  composed with  four spot

with my new optimal solver, i can show that the position

     superflip  composed with  four spot

is exactly 26 quarter turns from start.  this gives a new lower bound
for the diameter of the cube group.  the previous lower bound, 24q, was
from the position superflip, and was first established by jerry bryan.

let  F2 B2 U  D' R2 L2 U  D'  be our choice of orientation of
four spot.  although four spot is not central, the position

     F2 B2 U  D' R2 L2 U  D'   C_U2

moves only face center cubies:  (F, B) (R, L).  (here  C_U2  denotes
whole cube rotation by 180 degrees about the U-D axis.)  since quarter
turns do not move face center cubies, we see that the sequence above
commutes with any sequence of quarter turns.  the same is also true
for
     superflip . four spot . C_U2

in terms of singmaster's fixed face model, this means that we can
cyclically shift a maneuver for superflip composed with four spot,
but the part that is cyclically shifted gets conjugated by the cube
rotation  C_U2.  for example:

(B  U2 L) (U' D  L2 F2 R2 B  U2 R' L' D  R2 D  F2 U  R2 D  B)

creates this position.  if we cyclically shift the first three twists
to the end, we get another maneuver for this position:

(U' D  L2 F2 R2 B  U2 R' L' D  R2 D  F2 U  R2 D  B) (F  U2 R)

this observation about cyclic shifting enables us to prove

proposition 1.  superflip  composed with  four spot  is a local
                maximum in the quarter turn metric.

proof.  we need to show that any quarter turn takes us closer to
        start.  the 12 different twists split up into two different
        types under the symmetry of this position:  {U, U', D, D'}
        and {R, R', F, F', L, L', B, B'}.  we claim that any maneuver
        for superflip composed with four spot must contain twists of
        both types.  a maneuver consisting only of twists in
        {U, U', D, D'} clearly cannot produce this position.  also,
        a maneuver consisting only of twists in
        {R, R', F, F', L, L', B, B'} cannot flip any edges.  thus
        both twist types must occur.  now consider a minimal
        maneuver for superflip composed with four spot.  we may
        cyclically shift (and apply symmetry) so that the last twist
        is  U'.  thus, applying  U  cancels this last twist and
        brings us closer to start.  similarly, we can cyclically shift
        to get a minimal maneuver ending with  R', so applying  R
        also brings us closer to start.  since any twist is equivalent
        to  U  or  R , we have proved local maximality.     qed

the significance of this proposition is that this is the first case
beyond the hoey-saxe local maxima in which we can prove local
maximality without computer searching.  (please correct me if i'm
wrong about this.)

dan hoey noted (a long time ago) that the position  four spot  is a
local maximum.  however, i don't see that this can be proved without
computer search.  the sticking point is that four spot can be achieved
using only {R, R', F, F', L, L', B, B'}.  however, no minimal maneuver
consists only of these twists, a fact determined by computer search.

similar to the transformations for superflip, we have three
transformations to apply to maneuvers for superflip composed with
four spot.

     we may conjugate by any of the 16 cube symmetries that fix
     the U-D axis.
     we may cyclically shift the maneuver, as described above.
     we may invert the maneuver.

proposition 2.  by using the three transformations above, any maneuver
                for superflip composed with four spot can be transformed
                into one that begins with one of the six sequences

                R  U          R' U  D        R' U  F'
                R' U  R'      R' U  B'       R' U  L'

proof.  as shown in prop. 1, any sequence for superflip composed with
        four spot contains both types of twists.  thus, the two types
        occur as consecutive twists.  by cyclic shifting, and applying
        symmetry, we may suppose that the first two quarter turns are
        either  R U  or  R' U.  (this would already be enough reduction
        for my program).  we can cut down the case  R' U  further.
        there are eleven possibilities for the third quarter turn;
        only  U'  is not allowed.  the case  R' U U = R' U2  is
        equivalent under symmetry to  R U2, which is part of the case
        beginning with  R U.  the case  R' U D'  is equivalent under
        symmetry to  R D' U = R U D', again part of the case beginning
        with  R U.  the case  R' U B  inverts to  B' U' R, and this is
        equivalent to  R U B', which is part of the case beginning with
        R U.  similarly, the cases beginning with  R' U R ,  R' U F
        and  R' U L  invert to  R U R' , R U F'  and  R U L',
        respectively.  this leaves only the sequences listed above.  qed

my program exhaustively searched the positions

     superflip. four spot . R  U    through 22q  and

     superflip. four spot . R' U  D   \
     superflip. four spot . R' U  F'   \
     superflip. four spot . R' U  R'    >  all through 21q
     superflip. four spot . R' U  B'   /
     superflip. four spot . R' U  L'  /

and found no maneuvers.  thus  superflip  composed with  four spot
requires more than 24 quarter turns.  the total search time was about
153 hours.  to see that  superflip  composed with  four spot  can be
achieved in 26 quarter turns, use

U2 D2 L  F2 U' D  R2 B  U' D' R  L  F2 R  U  D' R' L  U  F' B'  (26q*, 21f)

it might be reasonable to ask for all 26q maneuvers.  this is probably
out of reach for now.  however, i suspect that there will be so many
different 26q maneuvers that it would not be of much use to see a long
list of maneuvers.  (i have a bunch already.)

superflip  composed with  four spot  also requires 20f.

proposition 3.  any maneuver for superflip  composed with  four spot
                of length <= 20f can be transformed to one that begins
                with one of the sequences   U2 R ,   R2 F  or   R2 U .

the proof is very similar to the reductions for superflip in the face
turn metric.

using this, a complete search for 20f maneuvers is straightforward.
there are two inequivalent 20f maneuvers for superflip composed with
four spot:

F  U2 R  L  D  F2 U  R2 D  F2 D  F' B' U2 L  F2 R2 B2 U' D   (20f*, 28q)
F  U2 R  L  D  F2 U  R2 D  F2 D  F' B' U2 L  U' D  R2 B2 L2  (20f*, 28q)

this also shows that no maneuver is simultaneously minimal in both
metrics.

I have created a page with a description of how I solve the 5x5x5.
Please check out www.wunderland.com/wts/jake.  Although I did spend a
fair amount of time on this page, I certainly consider it a first
draft, and I would appreciate any comments about it, either those
involving clarity of the explanation, or even better moves that would
perform the same functions.  Be warned that it is a long page,
although I'm sure you expected that.

One person wrote to me and said that he had all but two cubies solved.
I suspect his difficulty was "parity" which I cover in my Sixth Step.
I'm sure there are many good solutions to the 5x5x5, just as there are
for the 3x3x3, so if you have a half-solved cube you may need to scrap
your work if you want to use my solution.

Good luck.

Nobody has said so yet on the list, but I think this is
exciting news for Cube-Lovers, both the fact that a new
lower bound has been discovered for the diameter of the
cube group, and the fact that a new (and very long) local
maximum has been found by means other than computer search.

It seems to me that Mike's proof might provide an outline
for a method for looking for other local maxima.  I have
not at this point been able to use his method to find other
local maxima, but here is how it might work.

More generally, for any position x, calculate Symm(x)=K,
where K is as usual the subgroup of all k in M such that
x=k'xk, and where M is the group of 48 symmetries of the
cube.  Conjugation by K and grouping the elements of Q into
conjugate equivalence classes induces a partition on Q, the
set of twelve quarter turns.  In Mike's case, the partition
is {Q1,Q2} where Q1={U, U', D, D'} and Q2={R, R', F, F', L,
L', B, B'}.

The process I am going to describe is much simpler if we
confine ourselves to 2-way partitions of Q, such as Mike's
case.  I think the process I am descibing can be
generalized to more than 2-way partitions of Q, but some of
the steps get more complicated.  So for now we confine
ourselves to subgroups K of M which induce at most a 2-way
partition of Q.

Roughly speaking, this means that we need to find positions
that are fairly symmetric.  I have been meaning for a long
time to calculate a table of partitions of Q for each of the
possible 98 subgroups of M. Perhaps Mike's new result will
provide sufficient motivation to perform the calculations.

The next hurdle is that we must find positions x such that
x is not in <Q1> or <Q2>, so that a maneuver for x must
contain quarter turns from both Q1 and Q2.  Mike's position
certainly satisfies this criterion.   Notice that if we get
this far, we can say that a maneuver for x must contain at
least one element from Q1 and at least one element from Q2,
but the elements from Q1 and Q2, respectively, need not
necessarily appear at the end of the maneuver.  Also, by
the definition of Q1 and Q2, *any* maneuver from Q1 and Q2
can appear in a maneuver for x by K-conjugation.

So far, so good.  I would go about this type of a search by
determining which subgroups K of M induce a 2-way partition
of Q, and then by thinking about what a K-symmetric
position must look like.  But here's the rub -- the part I
cannot figure out *in general".  In order to get the
elements of Q1 and Q2 to the end of the maneuver for x, we
need positions which may be cyclically shifted, either in
the normal sense or in Mike's new sense where the part of
the maneuver that is shifted is conjugated by K.

There is a good bit of discussion in the archives about
cyclical shiftiness.  I'm going to go back and re-read that
discussion to see if it helps with this problem.  But any
position x whose symmetry group induces a 2-way partition
{Q1,Q2} on Q, where x is not in <Q1> or <Q2>, and where x
is cyclically shiftable (possibly with K-conjugation of
the shifted part) is a local maximum in the quarter turn
metric.

Subject: superflip composed with six spot

another position to consider is  superflip  composed with  six spot,
since its maneuvers also have a corresponding cyclic shifting property.
until recently, i didn't know any 24q maneuvers for this position, so
i had planned to do an exhaustive search through 24q.  however, by
looking at the new 24q maneuvers for superflip, i was able to modify
one to get a 24q maneuver for superflip composed with six spot:

D' R  L' F  L' F  B  U' B  L' F' U  F' U  D  R' U  R' F' D  L' U  D  F' (24q*)

as a result, i only did a partial 24q search, namely for maneuvers that
contain a half turn.  up to cyclic shifting and symmetry, the only such
maneuvers are

R' U  D  R' U  F' D  R' B  U' L' U' F' D  F' B' D' R' F  D  F  D' R2 (24q*)

and a suitable reorientation of the inverse maneuver.  (the inverse
position is the same pattern, but in a different orientation.)

superflip composed with six spot also requires 20f:

U2 F  B' R  F  L2 F2 D  B2 D2 R2 B' L2 F' D2 R2 D' B  R  B2  (20f*)

no maneuver is simultaneously minimal in both metrics; this is a
consequence of the partial 24q search.

Subject: New puzzle simulator
Date: Sun, 16 Aug 1998 11:32:28 -0400

I wrote up a puzzle simulator called Puzzler, containing the cubes
(2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5), a pyramid, a sphere, a skewb, and a
dodecahedron.  While not the same as a physical puzzle, its still pretty
fun to use.

Its just a beta version, just compiled yesterday, so there are bound to
be problems, and features that should/could be implemented.  Anyone
interested should download the program at
http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/puzzler.html, and let me know of any problems,
enhancements etc.

One of my friends asked me to implement the square 1 in the same
program.  In order to do so I would have to change a lot of the backend
code so I won't do so unless there is enough interest.

-Noel

P.S. I forgot, the program is for win95, win98 and winNT.

Subject: minimal maneuvers for X symmetric positions

X  is the subgroup of the cube symmetry group which preserves
the U-D axis.  there are 128 positions which have X symmetry:

     the UR edge can go in any of the 8 positions  UR, RU, DR,
     RD, UL, LU, DL, LD; this determines the location of the
     edges UB, UL, UF, DR, DB, DL, DF.

     the FR edge can go in any of the 4 positions FR, RF, BL, LB;
     this determines the location of the edges FL, BR, BL.

     the UFR corner can go in any of the 4 positions UFR, UBL,
     DRF, DLB; this determines the location of all the corners.

any combination of these is possible, which gives 128 positions.
4 of the positions have more symmetry, namely M symmetry.
(these positions are  start, superflip, pons asinorum, and
pons asinorum composed with superflip.)

minimal maneuvers for the other positions are:

as usual, when there are two maneuvers are given, this means that no
maneuver is simultaneously minimal in both metrics.  superflip composed
with four spot is #91. many of these are locally maximal.

I don't think Mike has said so explicitly, but he appears to
have adopted a very useful convention from Herbert Kociemba's
Cube Explorer 1.5.  To wit, Cube Explorer 1.5 flags the length
of a maneuver with an asterisk when the length has been shown to
be minimal. Cube Explorer 1.5 operates only in face turns, so it
omits the q or f designation of units.

But for example, Cube Explorer 1.5 might show the length of a
cube upon which it is operating as (13) meaning 13f, then later
in the search show the length as (12), and still later show the
length as (12)* to show that 12 face moves have been proven to
be minimal. The only difference between Mike's style and Cube
Explorer's style is that Cube Explorer puts the asterisk outside
the parentheses.

I loaded Mike's E-mail into Cube Explorer to take a quick look
at the X symmetric positions.  Many of them are familiar to
readers of this list, and all of them are quite pretty.
(Loading Mike's E-mail into Cube Explorer "just worked".  I
didn't have to edit it at all to remove extraneous text.  Cube
Explorer's maneuver reader seems to have a remarkable ability to
extract maneuvers in BFUDLR notation which are imbedded in other
extraneous text.)  If you have Cube Explorer 1.5 (and you
should!), I would encourage you similarly to load Mike's X
symmetric patterns into it and take a look.

The patterns look as expected for patterns which preserve the
U-D axis. The U and D faces are the same pattern.  The F, R, B,
and L faces are the same pattern and may be described as
being in the same orientation with respect to rotations of the
square.

For positions #1 through #62, the U and D faces may be described
as being symmetric with respect to the symmetries of the square.
They range from being solid, to having one dot, to being a +, to
being an X, etc.  All are glyphs.

Positions #63 through #124 are essentially the first 62
positions composed with superflip.  I had never noticed it, and
I don't *think* it has been described on the list, but for every
symmetry group, half of the corresponding positions can be
described as "basic" positions and the other half can be
described as the basic positions composed with superflip.  That
is, if Symm(x)=K, then Symm(xf)=Symm(fx)=K, where x is any
position and f is the superflip.

This is easy to see if we consider that  Symm(x)  is the set of all
m  in  M  that commute with  x, because

         m' x m = x     if and only if     x m = m x.

At some times since 1981 I've wondered whether symmetry discussions
are better done with commutativity rather than conjugacy.

So if  c  is any element of the center of G* -- i.e.,  c  commutes
with all elements of  M  and  G  -- then  Symm(x)=Symm(x c).  As is
well known to cube-lovers, the center of the usual cube group consists
of the identity and the superflip.  In the supergroup, we may also
compose these with Big Ben (all face centers rotated 90 degrees) and
Noon (Big Ben squared).

I am curious how the local maxima were determined.  4-spot
composed with superflip was based on sort of an "extended
symmetry" argument, but what about all the others?

If I had to guess, I would suspect that you found all minimal
maneuvers for each position and observed that there was a
maneuver terminating with each quarter (respectively, face)
turn for each position.  Or equivalently, perhaps you found all
minimal maneuvers unique to symmetry for each position and
observed that conjugation of the maneuvers would yield a
maneuver terminating with each required kind of turn.  Was it
something like this?

(All you would really need for the conjugation argument, since
you already know that the maneuvers in question preserve the U-D
axis, would be to find at least one minimal maneuver ending with
any of {U, U', D, D'} and to find another minimal maneuver ending
with any of {R, R', F, F', L, L', B, B'}.)

It is interesting that you found strong local maxima in the face
turn metric, rather than just "plain" local maxima.  In my
experience, finding strong local maxima with a computer search
is easier than finding "plain" local maxima.  Finding "plain"
local maxima includes finding weak local maxima (where at least
one face turn does not change the distance of the position from
Start).  If my guess about how you are identifying local maxima
is correct, then your method would not identify weak local
maxima.

Finally, I have mused previously to Cube-Lovers that strong
local maxima in the face turn metric may be extremely rare.  I
think I might be wrong.  My God's algorithm searches in the face
turn metric have already turned up more strong local maxima than
I expected, and your search of the X-symmetric positions turned
up more strong local maxima than I would have expected.

In short, I should not have included Big Ben in that paragraph, only Noon.

The long explanation is that both of these are in the center of the
usual supergroup, as is any position that differs from Solved only by
face center orientation.  But for the  Symm(x)=Symm(x c)  argument to
work,  c  must be in the center of the group generated by the union of
the supergroup with  M.  This is equivalent to saying that  c  must be
in the center of the supergroup and be M-symmetric.  Big Ben is only
C-symmetric.

Subject: minimal maneuvers for E symmetric positions

E  is the subgroup of cube symmetries consisting of rotations
(no reflections) that preserve the tetrad of corners  UFR,
UBL, DFL  and  DBR.  of course it preserves the other tetrad as
well.  there are 72 positions that have E symmetry:

     each corner must remain in place, but can be twisted.
     corners in the same tetrad must be twisted in the same
     direction; therefore, by conservation of twist, adjacent
     corners are twisted in opposite directions.

     the UR edge can go in any location in any orientation.
     this determines the location and orientation of all edges.

this gives 3 * 24 = 72 positions.  if the UR edge remains in the
F-B slice, then the position has more symmetry, namely H symmetry
(at least).  this accounts for 24 of the 72 positions; 20 of which
are H symmetric, and 4 of which are M symmetric.

E is a normal subgroup of M; in fact, it's the commutator subgroup.
therefore, any M conjugate of an E symmetric position is also E
symmetric.  the 48 remaining positions form 12 equivalence classes
under M conjugacy, of 4 positions each.  minimal maneuvers for these
are

as usual, i give a maneuver that is simultaneously minimal in both

local maxima in the quarter turn metric: #1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

(strong) local maxima in the face turn metric: #10, 11, 12.

yes, this is essentially what i did.  i added automatic symmetry
reduction to my program (this was a challenge to program, but it
makes things so much more convenient).  so now the program finds
all minimal maneuvers up to symmetry, from which local maxima can
be spotted easily.

i did not find all minimal maneuvers for #91 (superflip composed
with four spot) nor for #117 in the quarter turn metric, because
these are too far from start (26q, 24q respectively).  so for these
positions, which are locally maximal, it suffices to find minimal
maneuvers ending with each quarter turn.  as you see, symmetry is
helpful here.  also, all the X symmetric positions have order 2,
so any maneuver can be inverted.  this is also helpful.

yes, this is exactly correct.  i will leave it to someone who's more
interested in "weak" local maxima to determine those.

Subject: designs from Rubik's cubes

Hi, fellow cube-lovers
I am a recent member of the cube-lovers mailing list. I would like to
help me answer this question: has any of you constructed, or does anyone
of you know someone who has constructed, a composite, pleasant,
geometrical design on a set of Rubik's cubes? The design is a three
dimensional {but not necessarily cubical} structure that exhibits some
symmetry on all its faces. Such designs are quite different from the
picture-like structures built by Jacob Davenport. I saw his pictures
when I consucted an ongoing web search to answer the above question. So
far I was not successful, and so I seek your help.
I am the author of these designs. I know they can be done because I have
done them. I do not have a web page of my own yet, but a friend of mine
kindly offered to put three of these designs on his web page. They may
be seen at http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif/cube.html. This should
open my friend's speed cubing page. My designs are there under the
heading "Hana Bizek's cube art."  Yes, Jirka Fridrich is a speed cubist,
which is an art in itself. You will find other interesting things there,
including a signature of Erno Rubik.
A photo of a design has one flaw; you can only see three faces of the
design. What does the rest of the design look like? Answer: sometimes
opposite faces of the design are exactly identical, both in color and
geometrical pattern. One of my designs in Jirka's page, the so-called
ctyrsprezi design, is such a design. It has four colors only on its six
faces. Why this should be so is a cornerstone of the design theory. The
reason is explained in my book,"Mathematics of the Rubik's cube design,"
published last year. amazon.com has it online.
Well, O better end this message, or it will itself deberate into a book.
Any help you can offer in my search for a "cube sculptor" will be
gratefully appreciated. And of course I stand by these designs and
will answer any questions. My name is Hana M. Bizek and my email address
is hbizek@ameritech.net. Thank you very much.
I will be looking forward to hearing from you.  Best regards,
Hana

Subject: "Basic" vs. Superflipped Positions
To: Cube-Lovers <cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu>
Message-Id: <Pine.PMDF.3.95.980823231032.2685A-100000@PSTCC6.PSTCC.CC.TN.US>

I recently commented on the fact that half of Mike Reid's X-symmetric
positions were "basic" and the other half were superflipped versions of
the first half.  I further commented that this was true for all positions
associated with any symmetry group -- half are "basic", and the other half
are superflipped versions of the first half.  Well, I am not quite sure
that this is true in general.  Or more correctly, I am not sure you can
always tell the "basic" version apart from the superflipped version.

Consider any two positions x and xf, where f is the superflip.  We would
say that x is the "basic" position and xf is the superflipped position.
But if we define y=xf, then y is the "basic" position and yf is the
superflipped position, and it is also true that x=yf.

So which is the "basic" position, x or y? It appears that there is no way
to tell.  Yet when you look at X-symmetric positions, it is trivial for
the eye to see which ones are "basic", and which ones are superflipped.
So what is going on here?

I briefly (*very* briefly) hoped to find a unique subgroup H of G with
index 2 which did not contain superflip.  Then, it would have been natural
to call H the "basic" positions and Hf the superflipped positions.  But it
is well known to Cube-Lovers that the only subgroup of G with index 2 is
the subgroup consisting of those positions where are an even number of
quarter turns from Start.  And this subgroup does contain the superflip.
Therefore, there seems to me to be little possibility of a general way to
distinguish between "basic" positions and superflipped positions.

Upon further reflection, it seems to me that there is a natural way to
tell "basic" positions apart from superflipped positions for some symmetry
groups but not for others.  I have not examined all 98 symmetry groups (33
symmetry classes) of the cube in this regard, but I have looked at a few
of them, and can give a few examples.

Before looking at examples, we need to look at a subtle but important
point.  We may think of a position x as consisting of corners and edges
separately, so that x=x[c]*x[e].  Similarly, we may look at the symmetry
of the corners and the edges separately, as in Symm(x[c]) and Symm(x[e]).
The equation that relates the symmetries is
Symm(x)=Symm(x[c]*x[e])=Symm(x[c]) intersect Symm(x[e]).  But because
Superflip affects only the edges, we need consider only Symm(x[e]) when we
compare "basic" positions to superflipped positions.

Example 1.  Suppose Symm(x[e])=M.  Then it seems natural to view the
position as "basic" if all four edge facelets on each face are the same
color, and to view the position as superflipped otherwise. The eye sees
this distintion very clearly.

Example 2.  Suppose Symm(x[e])=X1.  X1 is the symmetry group in Dan Hoey's
taxonomy which preserves the U-D axis.  X2 and X3 are conjugate subgroups
preserving the F-B and R-L axes, respectively.  X is the symmetry class
consisting of X1, X2, and X3.  All of Mike Reid's X-symmetric positions
are in particular X1-symmetric.  For X1, it seems natural to view the
position as "basic" if all four edge facelets on the U and D faces are the
same color, and to view the position as superflipped otherwise.  For X2,
the same rule would apply to the F and B faces.  FOr X3, the same rule
would apply to the R and L faces.  The eye sees this distinction very
clearly.

Example 3.  Suppose Symm(x[e])={i,v}, where v is the central inversion.
For such a position, any particular edge cubie could be placed anywhere,
but each edge cubie would have to be placed diametrically opposite its
diametrically opposed edge cubie.  For example, if cubie uf were placed in
the rd cubicle, then cubie db would have to be placed in the lu cubicle,
etc.  Also, for Symm(x[e]) to be {i,v} the edges could not have any
additional symmetry.  In this case, I don't think there is any natural way
to distinguish between a "basic" position and a superflipped position.

Example 4. Suppose Symm(x[e])=I={i}.  In other words, the edges have no
symmetry.  In this case, I don't think there is any natural way to
distinguish between a "basic" position and a superflipped position.

Example 5. Suppose Symm(x[e])={i,c_u2}, where c_u2 is a 180 degree whole
cube rotation around the U-D axis.  In this case, the position would be
"basic" if opposite edge facelets on the U face were the same color and if
opposite edge facelets on the D face were the same color, and would be
superflipped otherwise.  The eye sees this distinction very clearly.

There are generally several different (equivalent) ways to
characterize a subgroup of the cube symmetries.  For example, of
the 48 symmetries, 24 of them are even and 24 of them are odd,
and 24 of them are rotations and 24 of them are reflections.
The E symmetries may be characterized as the intersection of the
even symmetries with the rotational symmetries, and hence
consist of the 12 even rotations.

The 12 even rotations consist of the identity, the three 180
degree rotations around the face axes (c_u2 around the U-D axis,
c_f2 around the F-B axis, and c_r2 around the R-L axis), and the
eight 120 degree rotations around the four major diagonal axes
(c_urf and c_ufr; c_ufl and c_ulf; c_ulb and c_ubl; and c_ubr
and c_urb).  It is the eight major axis rotations which give E
its tetradic nature.

In addition to the characterizations of the E positions which
Mike gave (the corners must stay home, perhaps twisted, etc.),
we can describe the E positions informally by the appearance of
the faces.  Each face must have the same pattern as its opposite
face, and each pattern must have the 180 rotational symmetry of
the square.

The hardest part (to me, at least) in thinking about what a
position x with Symm(x)=E must look like is to subtract out or
ignore those positions which are E-symmetric but which have more
symmetry.  Indeed, many of the Symm(x)=E positions look very
much like slightly broken versions of positions with stronger
symmetry.  For example, #3 and #6 look like slightly broken
6-spots.  #7, #10, and #12 look like slightly broken 6-H's.
#1, #2, and #4 look like slightly broken Pons Asinorums.  Etc.

This visual effect is the strongest if your cube adopts the
"opposite faces differ by yellow" convention, so that white is
opposite yellow, green is opposite blue, and red is opposite
orange.  Your eye will then tend to identify white with yellow,
green with blue, and red with orange.  With these
identifications having taken place, most (if not all) of the
Symm(x)=E positions look exactly like positions with more
symmetry.

Subject: depicting a cube

	With reference to Hana Bizek's reference to how one can show all six
faces of a cube, I found the following the most satisfactory.  View the F, U
and R faces along the diagonal.  Now imagine the back faces 'exploded' out,
i.e. moved outward along the axes.  When they are moved far enough, they can be
seen.  The effect is that the cube seems to be suspended in front of a corner
and the three back seem to have been projected onto the walls and floor.  I'll
try to make a drawing.

Well, that's a bit better, but one can't get it perfect on an orthogonal grid.

A mirror can be placed on those walls and floor so that the design's B,
L and D faces can be reflected off those surfaces. The design would need
to stand on a glass-topped table, so that the D face can be reflected
off the  mirrorred floor. The whole setup could be photographed.

Unfortunately, I do not have resources to implement this. I don't even
own a glass-topped table!

Here is a challenge for the programmers out there. Can you write an
applet that will slowly rotate my design in order for a viewer to see F,
B, R, L and U faces, then tilt it upward to expose the D face? Do these
moves any way you want, just make sure a viewer can see it all.Thank tou
very much.

You can find three of my designs at
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif/cube.html. Two designs there are
cubical. Opposite faces are identical, both in color and geometrical
pattern. To wit: e. g. F face is exactly identical to B face, etc. This
property holds for a majority of these designs, but there are
exceptions.

If static, generated images are acceptable, (i.e. if the pattern is more
important to your sculpture than its physical realisation in plastic),
you could achieve this reasonably easily with a ray-tracer - build the
cube model and situate it in a scene with three plane mirrors, or
perhaps models of some other reflecting objects for enhanced aesthetics
- perhaps even a glass topped table! A free ray tracer is available at
www.povray.org I have some source and sample images for cube models if
you are interested.

Hi,

my first mailing on this list. I've seen some stuff, and thought it
too hard (at the moment). _This_ discussion, however, I can handle!


Another way to do this is in VRML. It's quite easy to build up a model
of a cube in 3D, including colors.

For a sample of what can be done with VRML in combination with a computer
program to generate the stuff, go to:

http://www.iaehv.nl/users/richtofe/

Follow the link about 'Triplets'. These are 3D models, inspired by Douglas
Hofstadter. I have included some examples on that page, as well.

It wouldn't be hard to do the same for a cube model. Writing a text file
with LRUDTB and ' in it to describe the model, then and generating VRML is
not too hard.

This has the advantage over PovRAY that you can really rotate the model in
space, and look at it in all directions.

The mirror idea is nice, but it will mess up the design (Left-Right swap).

More thoughts/ideas?

Oh no! Please remember that those are Rubik's cubes. Their "physical
realization" is usually that they are stacked together to form larger
cubes. If *that* was all to the design problem, I wouldn't have the
nerve to make a posting to the cube-lovers msiling list. Some of its
members are first-class mathematicians.

I feel that an explanation of what I call the design problem is in
order. Ther goal of this problem is to create, by conventional cube
manipulation, a composite pleasant geometrical design on a set of
Eubik's cubes. The basic algorithm consists of three simple steps:
1} construct patterns on individual cubes
2} make sure that the colors match properly from cube to cube {color
control}
3} stack the cubes together.
You start with a set of solved cubes. If you have scrambled cubes, you
need to solve them. That is just one excellent reason why you *must*
solve the Rubik's cube comopletely. Being able to solve only one side is
woefully inadequate.

Don't  forget color control. Without it you don't have a design. This
unavoidable aspect of the design problem further complicates the design
algorithm. It is a little bit like chess. You try to consider two or
three moves ahead of your opponent to achieve a winning strategy..,. or
create a viable design from a set of Rubik's cubes.

The last step is easy. It is sort of like a three-dimensional jigsaw
puzzle. The patterned cubes you constructed are part of this jigsaw.

Here, in a nutshell, is a  description of the design problem. Please,
get our your Rubik's cubes and start twiddling.

Good luck,  Hana

#8. B2 F2 D  U' B' F  L  R' D  U'  (10f*)

This completes the list of strong local maxima 9f and 10f from
Start in the face turn metric.  I posted #1, #2, and #3
previously, but the rest are new.  9f is the shortest strong
local maximum.

I continue to think that all eight of these positions share a
special kind of symmetry that is related to the fact that they
are strong local maxima, but I can't quite get my arms around a
good description for this symmetry.  Generally speaking, they
look more symmetric if you look at corner cubies and edge cubies
separately than if you look at them in combination.  Also, they
look more symmetric if you look only at the colors of the
facelets (looking at two dimensional 3x3 faces) rather than
if you look at the location of entire cubies.

They do all share the following in common.  Looking just at the
colors of the facelets, all pairs of opposed 3x3 faces have the
same pattern for all eight positions. Hence, there are (up to)
three different face patterns for each position.  Also, if the
cube is colored according the "opposite faces differ by yellow"
convention, then the pairs of opposed face patterns for all
eight positions are the "yellow complements" of each other.
Finally, all the face patterns (and some of them are fairly
complicated, having as many as four colors) are symmetric with
respect a reflection across either a vertical or horizontal axis
of the 3x3 square making up the face.

Even though none of these strong local maxima are q-transitive
in the classic Saxe-Hoey sense, the "face symmetry" they all
share seems too unusual to me to be just a coincidence.

I think #8 is an especially interesting position.  All six faces
have the same face pattern, sort of a three colored checkerboard
(if that is not a contradiction in terms).  The position is
basically Pons Asinorum with the edge and corner cubies rotated
as a unit along a major diagonal axis relative to the fixed face
centers.

Subject: Rubik's cube kingdom

Hello, cube-lovers,

the following miniessay talks about that realm of human knowledge, where
the rubik's cube reigns supreme. The gates of this kingdom are open to
anybody, but only those who love the cube, venture beyond its gates. The
rest of humanity are either unaware of it, or ignore its existence.
Those folks are truly missing a lot. After finishing {if indeed you
choose to finish} this epistle, you may want to do several things:

  a} emit a few chuckles thinking what an insane idea this is

  b} pause to think about the contents, debating whether all this is
     worth your precious time

  c} email your ideas, commenrts, etc, to me at hbizek@ameritech.net

Thank you. 

                WELCOME TO THE RUBIK'S CUBE KINGDOM.

This is not a kingdom of people, it is a kingdom of ideas. Its king is
the Rubik's cube. We pay homage to our king by trying to learn more
about him and see if this knowledge could be extended to other areas of
human pursuit. I am now going to tell you what I think those areas are
and point to a couple of web sites where results may be found. This is
by no means a finite list. As new ideas occur to all of us, they should
be added to the kingdom.  The Rubik's cube kingdom is there for anyone
to benefit from, just as any other field. Please feel welcome to sample
and browse.

Initially, of course, one should master the Rubik's cube solution. The
ability to solve one side should be the absolute minimum. It is far
better and morre satisfying to be able to solve the cube completely,
that is, get all six sides a solid color. I have seen numerous solution
algorithms on the web. Someone might consider collecting those varied
algorithms in a handy volume for cube lovers and others to use. I have
seen some solutions on the web, in which you are presented with a
solved cube in a little square field. You are instructed to press 's'
to scramble the cube and 'r' to restore {i. e. solve} it. That is not
solving the cube! You have to understand the steps of the solution
algorithm.

The areas where the cube has any impact are art, mathematics and
science. Let me look at art first. Quite recently there was a small item
in TIME magazine stating  that the cube has entered Hollywood and is
the subject of some movies. I heard that there are also songs about the
cube. By the above definition those human expressions too belong in the
Rubik's cube kingdom. However, I am going to zero on two aspects:
pictures and sculptures.

At http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeArt one may see creations by
the people at Wunderland company {the spelling is correct} that depict
mostly 2-dimensional picture-like creations from a set of many Rubik's
cubes. They just show the pictures, thwy do not  describe their method
in any book, as far as I can determine {of course, I can be wrong}. But
from my  observation it seems to me they need to be worried about
continuity from one side of the cube to the one side of the next cube,
which is not too complicated. 

The sculptures are 3-dimensional structures and require some symmetry
on all the  faces of the cube, simultaneously. In this case, the
complete solution of the cube is a must. The required algorithm is
described in the book, "Mathematics of the Rubik's cube design," written
by me and published last year. As far as I know, I am the author of
these designs, described in my previous postings to the cube lovers. I
have stated a web site where three of these designs may be seen. I
repeat it here for completeness:
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif/hana1.html

Next, I am going to talk about science. I have to warn you: those
ideas are, as far as I know, unknown and undeveloped, as is, indeed,
the design Problem itself. First on the agenda is fractals and fractal
design prototypes. Some of the designs in my book, such as the Menger
sponge, are such fractals. One can think of the Rubik's cube as a
three dimensionl version of a Cantor set, which is a {one dimensional}
line.  Actually these fractals are neither three nor one dimensional;
they have fractional dimensions. But the 0th iteration are. One can
formulate rules for geometrical fractal iteration. Remember that
iteration preserves fractal dimension.  By the same token, for integer
dimension, it really doesn't matter if you subdivide by m or 10000n;
the dimension is always the same. Between the integer dimension there
are fractals of fractional dimension. These fractals can be reached by
breaking up of integer dimension or by some other
manipulation. Fractal design made from cubes suggest one such
manipulation, as witnessed by box fractal. But this is supposed to be
a miniessay, nor a book.

Another idea consists of computerizing the design algorithm, in some
comprehensive way so that the Rubik's cubes are used as 3-dimensional
cellular automata. It would be deliciously complicated game, perhaps
employing some of the patterns in the design theory.

Finally there is the question of what happens if internal combined faces
of a design that touch are colored the same? I will let you figure that
one out. It is not too hard. Personally, I had much more difficulty to
properly formulate the question than to provide the answer.

Finally, there is math. In this respect the ideas were formulated
partially by mathematicians in the 1980s during the heyday of the cube,
partially by cube lovers today. I would like to include my book in this
category.  At least its title indicates that there is some math, if that
has to be the only reason. And, as every cube lover knows, all possible
elements of a Rubik's cube form a mathematical group. A visitor to the
Rubik's cube kingdom will surely encounter some joys of group theory on
his travels.

Any objections, criticism, etc are welcome. Free speach prevails in the
Rubik's cube kingdom. Suppress free speach and not much is left.  

Hana

[ Moderator's note: I am somewhat concerned at the low
  information-to-woowoo ratio of Hana's "miniessay", but I think
  there are enough real ideas there that I've passed it on to the
  list.  I must, however, note that while "free speach" may prevail on
  the Internet, the contents of the cube-lovers mailing list is
  subject to editing for topicality, format, sensibility, and content.
  Which is to say that if the silliness level gets too high, you may
  have to find somewhere else to make your "kingdom".  I encourage
  guidance from the readership on where to draw the line; send your
  opinions to cube-lovers-request@ai.mit.edu. --Dan ]

Subject: Dogic
Date: Tue, 8 Sep 1998 20:53:22 -0400

A while back we heard about the puzzle "Dogic", an icosahedron puzzle.
After playing around with it for a while, I decided to model it in
Puzzler (http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/puzzler.html), since I dare not mix
it up until I have some moves to work with :)

That brings me to the question, has anyone made up a notation for moves
with the Dogic puzzle?  Perhaps similar to the Megaminx (R++, R+- R--
etc) moves.  I have yet to seriously sit down and try to solve it, but
eventually I will find some time and a few rudimentary moves would be
very helpful.

Also, if anyone wants a physical puzzle to play with, Hendrik Haak
(mailto:HendrikHaak@t-online.de) still has some available (that's where
I got mine)

-Noel

P.S. To those using the puzzler version, moves can be made along any of
the 12 axis in both minor (just the tip pieces) or major (the entire
slice) by dragging a cubie from one place to its eventual destination (I
didn't bother putting an entry for it in the helpfile).  Also, I had a
few requests for more detailed information on the puzzles and solving
them.  I have very nice solutions for the Megaminx, Pyraminx and Cubes,
but nothing written down for the Skewb, Masterball, or Dogic puzzles
(the skewb and masterball are quite easy so perhaps a solution is
unnecessary).  Any notes or information on these puzzles would be
appreciated.

While it is true that most of the cube art on our web pages 
(http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeArt) is two dimensional and 
therefore pretty easy to make, I have made a few designs that were bloody 
difficult.  I'm rather proud of writing "WTS" on both sides of a hundred 
some cubes.  I'm particularly happy with the chessboard made of four 5x5x5 
cubes with a symmetrical design on the sides.  Some of my failed 
experiments were still tough to make, even if they didn't look very good.  
If anyone has any good 3d design suggestions, I'd like to hear them.

Hana, here is my favorite pattern for a single 3x3x3 cube.  There is no 
easy set of twists from solved to this pattern.  I had fun doing this 
pattern on a 5x5x5 cube, and you should be able to create an analogous 
pattern with all of your cubes:

   -------
  |\ * * *\ 
  | \ o o *\
  |x \ x o *\
  | * \------     
  |x o|* x o|
  | * |     |
  |x *|x x o|
   \x |     |
    \x|o o o|
     \|------
              
The same pattern should be on the other three faces with the other three 
colors.  My ASCII art isn't the greatest but I hope this is clear enough.

I finally have had enough time to add support to my God's Algorithm
program to calculate weak local maxima.  The shortest strong local maximum
in the face turn metric is 9f, but the shortest weak local maximum has not
previously been verified.  It has long been known that Pons Asinorum is a
weak local maximum at 6f from Start.  I have been curious to know if Pons
is the shortest, and if there are any other short weak local maxima.

It turns out that 6f is indeed the shortest.  There are two such positions
unique to symmetry which are 6f from Start, the Pons and one other.  The
other one is quite pretty:

L2 R2 D2 U2 B' F  (6f*)


The eighteen neighbors are as follows.

L2 R2 D2 U2 F2 B'  (6f*)
L2 R2 D2 U2 F      (5f*)
B' F  L2 R2 D2 U'  (6f*)
