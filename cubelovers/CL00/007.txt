David Singmaster is a prof at an English university whose
name escapes me, who publishes a 40-page pamphlet on cubing
for about $5.00.  It took me months to get; I have it for xeroxing
in my posession.  It contains many transforms, including many
wierd solve-the-edge-cubes-first solutions.  As I have
pointed out, his noncanonical move counting is a problem.
