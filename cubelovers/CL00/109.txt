Seems the ever popular CUBE is getting places.  In this month's issue
of one of America's popular men's entertainment magazines there is a picture
of Zsa Zsa Gabor holding a cube, and a small explanation of what the cube is,
and who's marketing it, etc.  (Isn't Zsa Zsa Hungarian?) The way she is
holding her cube you see 2 faces - orange and green - and it is right.
