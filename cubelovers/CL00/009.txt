A simple transformation with a pretty resulting design:
Let CS = center slice which faces you and is
parallel to the axis of your body.
Then CS up 90, rotate cube 90 in either direction so
that the CS turns in the direcion of rotation.
Performing these two operations 3 more times gives
the desired result.
