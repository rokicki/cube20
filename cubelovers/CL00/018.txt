Yes, the cross design is possible.  I will let BSG try and describe it
if people want.  It is fairly straightfoward to tell if a position is
reachable.  I am thinking of onlining the proof that there are 12
equivalence classes of cubes (I think I have a fairly simplified
version), and if I do it should contain an algorithm to tell if a
position is reachable.
