IS IT POSSIBLE?

I just got a note from Martin Gardner who plans an article about the
cube in Sci.Am. sometime. But he claims that a person names
THISTLETHWAITE has proved a restoration procedure of 50 moves
and believes he can reduce it to 41.

Gardner also says that a 2x3x3 solid is selling in Hungary, also
by Rubic.
