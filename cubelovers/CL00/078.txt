   Has anyone learned whether Ideal will be "supporting" Rubik's Cube
with some vehicle like Parker's "Soma Addict" newsletter of some years
past?  They will certainly be missing a bet if they don't.  Just the
number of people who would pay for a solution...
 ...hmm...maybe we shouldn't suggest it to Ideal after all..
