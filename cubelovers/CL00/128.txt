Genereally, I have found themacros supplied by DAL to be quite useful,
but t|ere are a few bugs i've noticed. First of all, oC8&C9,
I believe DAL has the cw & ccw notations reversed.
Regarding C7:	What is M? I have not seen it referenced anywhere.
and last, in maco EB: the last move is f, not F.
(I`guess it was the 5 beers and 2 Drambuies.)
