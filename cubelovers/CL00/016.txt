Does anyone know a transformation (or series of) which will produce
the following pattern on each face where X and O are two different colors.

	|X O X|
	|O O O|
	|X O X|

I think this may not be possible which brings me the question which
is how one can say whether a particular arrangement is or is
not possible.
