Hi,

I'm currently working on my MSc dissertation on this topic. I'm
working in Java to build a Cube to which I can then apply algorithms
in Singmaster Notation. The approach I'm taking is to use an
incremental breadth first search to generate a library of
"interesting" macro moves (Richard Korf did some work on this a few
years ago).  I would then like to use a heuristic approach with the
macro moves to head towards the solution. Currently I am thinking of
using a version of the Manhattan distance but I would be grateful for
any other heuristic suggestions.

I would also be interested in a reply to Paul's question about the
least number of theoretical plane moves.

Best Regards,

[Moderator's note:  What is a "plane" move?  All cube metrics count a
 quarter-turn of a face as a single move.  Some also include a
 half-turn of a face.  Some also include a quarter-turn of a center
 slice, or perhaps also a half-turn of a center slice.  I've not seen
 anyone count an antislice move as a single move, though it seems
 fairly reasonable to me, since it's fairly easy to do with one motion
 of the wrist.  In fact, we might even include moves such as "F^2 B"
 under the rubric of "plane moves", so that there would be 45 generators.

 My recollection is that you may find fairly good bounds in the
 archives for the first two metrics--say a ratio of 3:2 or less--but
 not for the others. --Dan ]
