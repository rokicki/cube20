How about giving the player a choice between using a default
configuration, or customizing his/her own buttons, like in certain home
video games such as Street Fighter?

Another cool feature would be two simultaneous cubes, so players can
battle head to head, also like Street Fighter.  (I really like Street
Fighter)
