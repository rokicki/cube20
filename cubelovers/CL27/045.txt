White powder, used like graphite, sometimes for locks? Possibly
Tri-Flow (tm), which (iirc) is a Teflon (tm) particle suspension.

I experimented with quite a variety of lubricants, found a good one,
and then one of the periodic disruptions of my life came along and I
failed to note which it was! :(

"Teflon" is a Du Pont trade name for PTFE, polytetrafluoroethylene.

Btw, in case you do a Web search, watch "silicon" vs. "silicone".
The chemist who coined the term "silicone" was wildly optimistic
about people's ability to keep the two straight. Silicon, the
chemical element, is gray, opaque to visible light, brittle like
glass, and a lousy lubricant. You don't normally see it, nor can you
normally buy it.

Silicones are chemical compounds that include the chemical element,
silicon.
