Subject: cube computer solutions using procedural languages
Date: Thu, 22 Jul 1999 11:24:45 -0500

Have any of you done any work on solving the cube with computer programs
using procedural languages such as C? I've seen books on the manual methods
of solving the cube (with the cube in your hand) such as David Singmaster's
texts but haven't seen any publications regarding computer solutions using
procedural languages.

Do you have any suggestions you can pass my way? I am a good programmer but
not a cube solution expert. I am just a novice at best when it comes to cube
algorithms and efficient cube solutions.

I am attempting to work on a project involving solving the cube
programmatically and also planning on doing analysis/comparisons of various
algorithms to solve it. Any help, suggested methods, advice, tables,
algorithms, etc. that you may be able to provide me would be very greatly
appreciated.  I can think of a number of ways to approach this task but
would also like some of your folks expertise as well.  I am having trouble
getting going in the right direction.

Also what is the theoretical least number of plane movements that are
required to solve the cube no matter what its configuration and why?

You can reply directly to me.

Thanks in advance,
