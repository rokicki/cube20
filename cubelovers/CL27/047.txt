It seems my help file is poorly written, I've gotten some surprise replies
from people who I have told...

Puzzler does support cube move macros, in standard UDFBLR notation (use
udfblr in lowercase for inner slices and meM for central slices in the 5x5x5
cube).  To use this feature hit enter and enter the move...F2 will move the
F slice 2 times, F3 and F' are equivalent and will move counterclockwise 1
time, F1 and F move clockwise 1 time.  You can enter any number of moves in
sequence in a string then by hitting enter again the move will be executed.

One more note: these macros assume the cube is oriented so that you can see
three faces (exactly like the initial orientation of the cube).  So F refers
the the bottom left face, R is the bottom right face and U is the upper
face.

  /\

|\U /|

Last note: I assumed that UDFBLR was the notation used by most people.
However if there is another notation that is used or if some other notation
is required for experimentation, let me know and I'll put it in.
