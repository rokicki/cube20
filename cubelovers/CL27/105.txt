Hi, Friends!

The original color schema is (designed by Erno Rubik, and it is written in
Rubik's: The Magic Cube book also): blue is opposite to green, white is
opposite to yellow and red is opposite to orange. The differerence between
each opposite colour-pair is yellow: blue + yellow = green, red + yellow =
orange and white + yellow = (guess it! :-).  If blue is on the top and red
is in front of you, yellow is on the right side.
