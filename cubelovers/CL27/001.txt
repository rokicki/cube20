I have a Rubik's Magic Strategy Game that consists of the playing board,
16 playpieces and instructions.  Unfortunately we have lost the
instructions and our son, who's game it is no longer lives at home and
can't remember how it was played.

Would you have or know where I might obtain a copy of these
instructions. The game is of no use to us with out them.  The game was
distributed by Matchbox toys in 1987.

Any help you can lend would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You,
