The most problematic ones I've come across so far are the "Wisdom" Ball
(everything has to be lined up exactly right), Alexander's Star (same),
and the Pyramorphix (same). It's a neat puzzle, but it seems to have a
mind of its own, many times forcing you to turn a half/direction you don't
want to and gets jammed constantly. When you finally do get past the jams,
it's completely unexpected and flies at super speed. On top of this, the
centres are so sharp that when it happens, it often cuts your fingers. Has
anyone managed to come up with a fix for this? My guess is all that would
need to be done to fix all of these problems would be to make the edges of
the centre pieces more rounded, but I can't be sure about that.
