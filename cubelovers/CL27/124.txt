Subject: Re: Rubik's Cube Perpetual Calendar

	In response to Chris Pelley's message about a Rubik's Calender Cube, I
would like to say that I made one, although it may not be identical to the
one that Rubik manufactured. (I thought up the idea before I knew one had
been made commercially) I just mapped the letters and numbers out on paper
and then printed out all the characters I'd need with my printer and
affixed them to a blank cube.
I really lucked out because the scotch tape I had was exactly the same
width as the width of one cubie! I also used an exacto knife so I could affix
multiple characters at once, then cut between the cubies with the knife.
An example of how the date reads is:
 J U L
   2 8
19 9 9

The 19 (and 20 once we get there) are on one cubie.

I've attached a jpg of how I arranged all the characters. I make 
no guarantees that is works, but I'm pretty sure it does.
Sorry to those of you who can't receive files. I would have made the
drawing ASCII, but I can't make upside or sideways characters =(
In the drawing there may be some discrepancy between O the letter and zero.
The 'thinner' one is zero. As you can see, my cube is still on Jul 27. I
haven't changed it yet since yesterday.

[Moderator's note: I don't send binary attachments out on this list.
 However, I was able to decode Corey's picture, and here's a diagram.
 The characters ^ > v and < denote symbols that are rotated 0, 90,
 180, or 270 degrees clockwise, respectively.

             N^ .. ..
             O< 1v 0<
             Nv Ev 0<

  R< C^ V^   D^ A^ 1<   6^ 6^ 19v  20> .. B^
  6v 3< ..   .. .. 0^   6v 2v ..    .. 0> 9^
  A< 1> T>   Pv 2> G>   Lv Uv Jv    F< 5> Sv

             C< 8< Y^
             3v .. P>
             O< 4> Mv

 I believe the corner marked 0< should be 0^.  The cube only goes
 through 2001, though the addition of 2< on the blank corner would add
 another year.

 Sorry for the delay in sending this message out. --Dan ]
