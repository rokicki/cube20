Dear Gary

Sorry to hear that you had to wait 8 weeks for your Prof. cube to arrive.
So here is some good news for Cube Lovers. We are offering free
Airmail Postage for all of our puzzles ordered during the Summer Holidays.
I would also like to announce our New PUZZLER CHALLENGE of the Month
competition.  Starting with the 3x3x3 cube and Orbix which can be played
both with mouse or SpaceOrb.
The fasted time in each category, puzzle plus mouse or SpaceOrb receives
a free puzzle of their choice.  There will be a different Puzzle each month.
See: http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/JPuzzler/challenge.html
You can practice on line at:

For all cube lovers that do not have a SpaceOrb and would like one, we have
arranged a special deal with Spacetec who will ship the SpaceOrbs ordered
directly by UPS, at the Special Price of US$45.00 including free delivery in
the USA & Canada, add US$16.00 for all other countries, see our Puzzle Shop.

I will be announcing the start of the "Mind Sports Olympiad 2000, Puzzle
Championships soon.  There will be great prizes, puzzles must be played both
online as well as the real thing.  The finals will be held August 19 - 27
the Year 2,000 in the National Hall at Olympia in London UK, which has
9,000 square meters of floor space (approx 100,000 square feet).
Something very spectacular is being planned for the millennium year. We
intend to smash the record for the largest number of entries at any
Olympiad ever, which currently stands at 10,744 for the Olympic Games in
Atlanta 1996. This will be achieved by having a number of "biggest ever"
tournaments including the Puzzle Championships within the Mind Sports
Olympiad.

HAPPY PUZZLING TO ALL
Uwe
