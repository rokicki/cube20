I recently saw one of the original Ideal Perpetual Calendar cubes sell on
EBAY for over $100 US dollars!  I decided it would be cheaper and more fun
to try and make my own.  Based on photos I have collected, I've tried to
reconstruct the original sticker scheme.  This turned out to be quite a fun
puzzle by itself, since there are only a few ways it can be done.  For
example, by a lucky coincidence, there just happen to be exactly the right
number of sides for the middle letters of the months (P, O, C, A, E, and U).

I did a quick scan of the cube-lovers archives to see if anyone had posted
the sticker scheme before.  I found nothing.  I was wondering if anyone who
still has their calendar cube could post either a detailed description, or
even photos from a few different angles.

My own homemade version can be seen here:

I just printed out the stickers I needed on paper, then cut and scotch-taped
them to a "blank" cube.  I plan to make a somewhat higher-quality version
with real stickers once I nail down the original Ideal sticker
configuration.

Thanks to anyone who can help!
