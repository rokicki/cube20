Subject: Speed cubing

Hello, Wayne and other speed cubists,
    if you see about 15 year backwards you would realize that a few
speed cubists have their average time below 20 sec and quite a lot of others
below 25 sec.
But you are interested in CURRENT Best Time and Average Time, I see.
After a few weeks of practicing my times are:
18 sec, 24 sec, (not bad after some years of 'abstinence' :-))
My method is Jiri's.
Beside that, I practice in solving the cube in minimum moves (face moves)
for which I use slightly different method for first two layers:
2x2 subcube first, 2x2x3 next, 2x3x3 - two layers and for the last layer
I may or may not use some more moves than Jiri's method uses.
My average number of moves is about 48 within 2 min restriction.

    Mirek
