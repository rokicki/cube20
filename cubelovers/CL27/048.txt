Subject: Building a twisty puzzle

I have been in the process of building plans for a twisty puzzle that is
no longer available.

I have been re-doing the design for a few weeks now and I want to start
molding or crafting the pieces soon. This is where I am coming undone.

I believe I will have some success crafting the three different pieces
required using clay, and filing back the pieces once dry.

>From here, I believe making plaster cast molds of the clay pieces will
allow me to start making all the identical pieces.

Now, the problem... what can I use to fill the mold? Can I use plastics
or a type of resin?

I would greatly appreciate any ideas or input. I'll be posting the
design on my site as soon as they are nearing completion. Maybe I can
get comments on whether the whole thing will work at all.

Many thanks,
Wayne

[ Moderator's note: Should this turn out to be a puzzle covered by a
  patent, I'll have to drop discussion of the subject. It is my under-
  standing that construction of patented objects is an infringement
  even if the object is made for personal use, and even if the patent
  holder has ceased production.  But I have no objections to the
  general topic of materials and construction techniques suitable for
  puzzles, though if any subscribers find this drifting too far from
  the topic, please let cube-lovers-request@ai.mit.edu know.  --Dan ]
