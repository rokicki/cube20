i already sent this to noel directly, but since others are sending
suggestions here i thought i'd toss in my thoughts about a keyboard cube
interface...

this is a wonderful user interface design challenge.  i've thought about it
before, because i have never been comfortable with any of the mouse-based
interfaces for moving 3d objects around.  i've never used one that seemed
fully intuitive to me.

i'd love to see an interface like this:

* 5 faces of the cube visible at once (all except B), perhaps something
like this (except square, and with the individual cubies showing of course):

      +------------------+
      |\                /|
      | \      U       / |
      |  \            /  |
      |   +----------+   |
      |   |          |   |
      | L |    F     | R |
      |   |          |   |
      |   |          |   |
      |   +----------+   |
      |  /            \  |
      | /      D       \ |
      |/                \|
      +------------------+

* unshifted keys for turning each of the visible faces either CW or CCW, a
total of 10 keys in all, and repeated on the left- and right-hand side of
the keyboard.  the following diagram shows the cube operations thus
associated with various keys (though the diagram is laid out mostly like
the keyboard, i've added space between the hands for clarity):

     w:L'  e:U'  r:U   t:R         y:L'  u:U'  i:U   o:R

       s:F'        f:F                     j:F'        l:F

         x:L   c:D'  v:D   b:R'          n:L   m:D'  ,:D   .:R'

* shifted keys for turning the cube itself.  again, available on both
hands.  3 axes of rotation, two directions each ==> only 6 keys needed on
each hand.  but why not have even more duplication?  for example, suppose
(in real life) you want to roll the cube forward away from you.  you might
do it by either grabbing it from the R side or the L side.  hence the same
10 keys as above, when shifted, work to turn the entire cube in the same
direction as they turn the faces when unshifted.
