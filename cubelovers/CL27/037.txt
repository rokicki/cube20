I added support for the SpaceOrb 360 by SpaceTec to Puzzler, grab this
version at:

http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/Puzzler.EXE

You must have a SpaceOrb 360 to try it out, but it is very very nice to use
compared to the mouse.  Twist the orb to rotate the puzzle, and press the
buttons and twist to do moves.  After a little practice you'll be able to
solve a cube like it was in your hands!

Only the cubes (all sizes) have support for the SpaceOrb, I may add support
for the other puzzles at a later date.
