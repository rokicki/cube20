Dear Cube-Lovers list:

I received several very interesting replies to my e-mail last week
regarding inventing techniques to solving cube puzzles.  Here are some
excerpts of note that were e-mailed to me but not the list.

First, part of what I wrote ...

Wei-Hwa Huang sent me this teaser about conjugation.

Later, at my request, Wei-Hwa Huang was kind enough to elaborate on
conjugation.

Tom Magliery also has a system for discovering solution techniques.

I also received a good suggestion that discovering new sequences may
be easier on a computer simulator.  This, way the cube can be reset to
the solved state quickly before each new attempt to make it easier to
see what the trial sequence actually changes.  Unfortunately, I lost
this particular e-mail and forget who sent it, so I cannot attribute
it.  My apologies to the author.

Fred Wheeler
