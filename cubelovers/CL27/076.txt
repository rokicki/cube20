The game is similar/equivalent to Rubik's Eclipse. The rules are as
follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set Up:
At the beginning of the game, the board is empty. One player
takes the 8 circle pieces, and the other player takes the 8 square
pieces.

Objective:
To win the game you must get 3 of your game pieces of the same
color (black or silver) in a "locked" row, either vertically, horizontally
or diagonally. A row of 3 is "locked" when none of the game pieces
in it can be flipped onto an adjacent square, because all the
adjacent squares are occupied.

Rules of play:
Players alternate in taking turns. The Circle player starts the game
by placing a circle piece, either side up, somewhere on the board.
Subsequently, starting with the Square players's first move, each
player's turn consist of two actions: Flip and Place,  _in that order._

Flip:
On each turn, the player must flip _any_ one of their opponent's
pieces already on the board. Flipping a piece means moving it to
any adjacent vacant square (horizontally or vertically, but not
diagonally) while _reversing_ the sides. The grey becomes black
and vice versa.

Place:
Each player must, on each turn, then place one of their pieces,
either side up, on any vacant square on the board, _even if this
results in a winning line for the opponent._

Note: A player _must_ flip an opponent's piece, even if this may
result in a winning line for the opponent.

If it is not possible to flip any of their opponent's pieces, the player
still goes on to placing a piece of their own.

Play goes on in this manner, with each player first flipping any of
their opponent's pieces (not necessarily the last one placed),
before placing a piece of their own. This means once placed on the
board,, players will never touch their own pieces again, but they
can change position and color of their opponent's pieces.

A player may leave an opponent's row of 3 without loosing the
game (provided it is not "locked").

Winning the Game:
The first player to archieve a "locked" vertical, horizontal, or
diagonal line of 3 of their _own_ game pieces, all with the same
color (black or silver), is the winner. A "locked" line is one in which
none of the 3 game pieces can be flipped because all the adjacent
squares are occupied.

If the game continues until the last piece is placed on the board,
and both players end up with a winning line, or neither player has
won, the game is a draw.
