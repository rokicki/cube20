[Moderator's note: This note was delayed because I generally give web
 page announcements lower priority than discussion.  Also, I usually
 drop announcements of changes to web pages that have been previously
 announced, since interested people can learn about the changes from
 the web page itself.  In the last 18 months or so, change notices for
 the following pages have been suppressed in this way:

     http://www.snipercade.com/cubeman
     http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hq8y-ishm/
     http://www.rubiks.com/
     http://www.ue.net/mefferts-puzzles/
     http://home1.gte.net/davebarr/Cube/
     http://128.192.40.238/pink/

 I'm willing to accept suggestions from the list membership about
 these policies; direct them to cube-lovers-request@ai.mit.edu. -- Dan ]
