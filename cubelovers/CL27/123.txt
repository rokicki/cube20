Chris,

You may want to look at www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/CustomCubes.html for 
some more information about making a custom cube.  Kristin also owns a 
French calendar cube, if I remember correctly, but I imagine that if you 
have successfully made a calendar cube that you don't really need to know 
how hers works.
