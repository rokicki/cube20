Subject: square-1 and megeminx

Is there a world record for the the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5 rubiks cubes?
If so what is it?

I was wondering what in your opinion is the hardest rubiks like cube
available right now.

On a web page several people from rated the greatest to least in
difficulty:

1)square-1
2)megaminx
3)5x5x5
4)4x4x4
5)?
6)?

Anyway it went something like that. Would you agree? I learnt how to
do square-1 all by myself.

Would you consider Square-1 one of the hardest cubes to do? If so would
this be considered good of me to learn? Although I only tried about 4
times my record when it was in a cube is 2 minutes. Do you know of a
world record for Square-1 or any good websites? Do you know what an
average would be for the best time? (perhaps 90 seconds for those
really into it?)

I was wondering how this compares to others times and acomplishments. At
http://byrden.com/puzzles/ I almost figured out the megaminx. I got
everything except the last row. Is the Megaminx one of the hardest
Rubiks like puzzles available? After I get bored of my 5x5x5 that I
orderd thinking about buying the megaminx. Do you know of a world record
on the megaminx? What would be a average time (perhaps 3-4 minutes?)

If you are not sure of answers thats fine. Then do you know of any good
websites I can go to?

Thank you very much.
