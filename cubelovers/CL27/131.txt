Subject: 5x5x5
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

My new 5x5x5 cube arrived a few days ago [took it 8 weeks to be delivered
'cos I was too cheap to get air-mail], and I have a couple of questions
pertaining to it:

Does anyone know a [reasonably] simple move to swap two edge pieces [the ones
on the very edge, not the center and not the corner] around?

Also, does anyone know of an equivalent to the Cube Explorer or anything like
it that can do 5x5x5 cubes?

Thank-you very much,
Gary (-;
