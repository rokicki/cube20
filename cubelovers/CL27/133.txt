Subject: scrambling puzzle

anyone know the "shortest" sequence of moves to "scramble"
a cube...  By scramble, my definition is:

all six colors on each face (except for 2x2x2), no 2 adjacent tiles
of the same color, and no "dominating" color on a face (ie for
a 3x3x3 cube, no more than 2 of a single color on a face, for
4x4x4, no more than 3 of a given color on a face).
