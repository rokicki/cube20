Gotcha.  And your idea seems sound.  But...

Arrow keys are sufficiently nonstandard I would very much prefer
something else - say, a shifted slice move to rotate the whole cube.
(Under some reasonable circumstances it can be hard to even tell what
you'll see for "the arrow keys", if they even exist.)

In passing,

> Extension C:  Add another grid for the right side of the cube:

>  v b n

I'd probably prefer
   u i o
   j k l
   m , .

I might even argue in favor of w e r / s d f / x c v for the other set,
simply because they're the home keys for the three principal fingers of
the left hand.

Other than that, it sounds like an eminently reasonable approach.
