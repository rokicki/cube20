Subject: Re: Reinventing (and some edge-flipping techniques)

	Der Mouse's message reminds me of a point which I had meant to include.
In my algorithm, most of the moving involves just two adjacent faces, which I
find easier to remember and to carry out.  The Spratt wrench (which I don't
really know, so I'll have to try it, BTW, who was/is Spratt?) doesn't have
quite this simple structure.
