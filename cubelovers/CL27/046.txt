Subject: Cube-manipulation programs

Well, with the current discussion going on about Cube manipulation
programs, I'll toss out my minor contribution the genre.

It's a C program that takes simple text lines describing maneuvers and
prints out a text representation of the resulting cube, together with
its cycle structure.  (I specifically chose to make it text-only
because I'm comparatively often on text-only links.)  It also allows
you to define names for operations and then use them as primitives.

A sample transcript, which defines the Spratt wrench as an operator and
then uses it to flip the four F-face edges:

> .set WRENCH (SLICER F)4
`WRENCH' defined
> WRENCH F2 WRENCH F2
Cube:
              u u u
              u u u
              u f u
        l l l f u f r r r b b b
        l l f l f r f r r b b b
        l l l f d f r r r b b b
              d f d
              d d d
              d d d
Cycles: (uf)+ (lf)+ (fr)+ (fd)+ [2]
Already centered

Another example:

> F SLICER F'
Cube:
              u f u
              u f u
              u u u
        l l l f f f r r r b l b
        l l f r d d b r r b u b
        l l l f f f r r r b u b
              d d d
              d b d
              d b d
Cycles: (u,b,d,f) (ub,bd,rf,fl) [4]
Centred: (ul,fl,fu,df,bd,rd,rb,ru,rf,dl,bl) (ulb,flu,dlf,bld) (ubr,fur,dfr,bdr) [44]
>

The numbers in [ ] are the smallest power to which that operator must
be raised to get the identity.

While I don't expect it ever attain the popularity of slick graphics
programs, there may be a few people interested in it; if anyone is, you
have only to drop me a line asking for a copy....
