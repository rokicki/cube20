If anyone has a Spaceball, it should make quite a nice input device.
It senses both torque about all 3 orthog. axes, and linear
displacement forces ditto; a total of 6 channels. Displacement could
select a layer, which could be highlighted (anyone for alpha-channel
translucency?), and torque would rotate the selected layer.
