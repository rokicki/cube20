There are two separate ideas here.

A process of the form XYX'Y' is called a commutator rather than a conjugate.
As you say, a commutator which moves very few cubies can be a very useful
process.  In fact, the number of cubies moved by XYX'Y' can be used as a sort
of informal measure of how close X and Y come to commuting. In the extreme case
where X and Y do commute, we have XYX'Y'=YXX'Y'=YY'=I so that no cubies are
moved. And conversely, two processes X and Y which "nearly" commute and/or
which intersect in very few cubies are good candidates for forming a useful
commutator.

A process of the form Y'XY is called a conjugate, and in particular is called
the conjugate of X by Y.  Note that YXY' is also a conjugate, and in particular
is called the conjugate of X by Y'.  This can be a little confusing because a
few books (incorrectly in my opinion) call YXY' the conjugate of X by Y.

Of Y and Y', which is the "real" process and which is the inverse is totally
arbitrary.  For example, if Z=Y', then Z'=Y.  So we could write a conjugate as
YXZ (the conjugate of X by Z) and another conjugate as ZXY (the conjugate of X
by Y) if we know that Y and Z are respectively the inverses of each other.

It is sometimes said that the conjugate Y'XY results in X shifted by Y, which
is the real utility of using conjugates to solve a cube.  Use a process you
know, but shift it to apply to a slightly different set of cubies.

Your process A=R'DRFDF' consists of the conjugates R'DR (the conjugate of D by
R) and FDF' (the conjugate of D by F').  It is often the case that useful
processes can be formed from both commutators and conjugates.

I am perversely proud that my own personal solution technique for solving the
cube consists of only two processes  --  one for the corners and one for the
edges  --  plus conjugates of those two processes.  I think it is indicative
of the power of conjugates that a cube can be solved with so few processes
provided only that they are combined with conjugation.  I am "perversely proud"
because my "two processes" technique probably yields one of the slowest
solution times of anybody on Cube-Lovers. I am always embarrassed to read about
those people who can do it in under 30 seconds.  I have taught myself some of
the faster techniques, but I always find that after a few months the only
technique my hands can remember is the old, slow one which I invented myself
many years ago.
