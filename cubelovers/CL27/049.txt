Subject: RE: Wrist pains

	When I went to a meeting on RSI problems, the speaker mentioned 'mouse
finger' which is about as debilitating as the white finger suffered by people
who use pneumatic drills (or jack-hammers).  When the speaker went to one
small computer design firm, she found two people suffering from it, one having
essentially lost the use of his right hand and having had to change to using
his left hand!
