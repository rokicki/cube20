Hello all,

I just want to say thanks to all the great help & advice everyone has
given me.  I wish I had time to E-mail everyone personally.  I'm so glad
I found out about this mailing list & all of the great web pages.  (Yay
internet!)  You have helped me reach my goal of beating the 30 second
barrier.

It all started w/ a little book fair where I picked up "The Simple
Solution to Rubik's Cube" by James G. Nourse for $.25 last year.  It
then snowballed, and I learned everything I could about the cube, spent
tons of money on different puzzles, & put a lot of time into it.  After
the first 4 months of intense cubing, my records are:

LAYER METHOD
30" best
36" average

CORNERS FIRST
26" best
37" average

I've been on a break for a while now ever since my hands started to
hurt.  Already I've started to loose my edge, & forgot some of the
moves.  I'm slower now, but I can still solve it under 45" guaranteed.
When the summer comes, school will be over and I'll have more free time
to train again  & hopefully reach my new goal of consistently finishing
under 30".  For now I'll give my hands a well deserved rest.

I just bought that book for a quarter on a whim.  Who knew a little cube
would have such a great impact in my life.  Thanks again for all of the
support.
