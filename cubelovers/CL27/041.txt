Many people have suggested different lubricants on their web pages.
Many have referred to silicon.  Where can I get this?  What other ones
are good?  Where can I find them?

[Moderator's note: I skipped sending this message two weeks ago
 because discussing cube lubrication with someone complaining of RSI
 symptoms seemed like a bad idea.  Then I got a large pile of
 interface-related messages.  But now that the backlog is mostly sent
 out, we might want to return to considering what lubricants to use.

 The lubes I remember from the archives are vaseline (greasy, erodes
 plastic slowly), soap (temporary), candle wax (drips flakes), and
 molybdenum disulfide (doesn't help, destroys cube quickly).  The only
 silicone product I've used is Armor-All, which is a protectant that
 provides a very little lubrication.  Does anyone know what silicone
 Alex is discussing? Any other good ideas on lubricants? -- Dan ]
