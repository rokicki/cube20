The cube is most likely the original Rubik's cube made in Hungary by Politoys
in the early 80's.  I bought many of those being in Czechoslovakia during the 80's.
Basically two types wrapped in a blue cardboard box were sold.
The first one has opposite colors w-y, g-b, r-o and it tends to fall apart after a
few months of speed cubing. A positive thing is that this type is well suited for
speed cubing, it doesn't require perfect aligning of cubicles. A negative thing is
that stickers don't last long, the glue is bad.
The second type has colors w-b, g-y, r-o, I think.  I always changed stickers to
get w-y oposite colors. There was a very slight difference between cardboard boxes.
This cube requires better aligning of layers before a next move (the construction
was a little bit improved), the glue is better, but the plastic used I rate lower.
