                        you meant to say "column" here

this is sort of a grab-and-move interface (in my mental picture, one
keypress "grabs" a face, and the next "moves" it).  i think i might like
this paradigm better than my own suggestion of before (unshifted single
keystrokes for face moves, shifted single keystrokes for cube rotations).
one nice advantage is that it makes it as easy on the keyboard interface as
it is in real life to do RL' and R'L, for which i suspect most people's
mental model is really a single turn of the middle slice.

i think i'd prefer some different key assignments than wei-hwa suggests,
though.  for example, i think i'd like to "grab" with the middle key in the
line, and then "move" with the outer one.  for example:
    "de" = R
    "dc" = R'
(according to wei-hwa's definition of "move", our two suggestions are
compatible.  mine only adds redundancy.)

>This method does not have moves for rotating the three front to back layers
>nor 180-degree moves.

another suggestion for 180-degree moves:  allow the user to tap the second
key in the sequence 2 (or 3) times for 180 (or 270 aka 90') degree moves.
thus, e.g., "wee" = U2.  this is intuitive not only to me:  someone else
posted that in their keyboard interface of years ago, they didn't use the
specially-assigned 180 keys, but in practice just tapped the 90-keys twice
anyway.

an additional suggested extension:  let me do things with both hands!
(this is my favorite aspect of my own keyboard interface, posted a few days
ago.)

perhaps a similar nonad(?) of keys could be used for R-face-relative
operations analogous to the F-face-relative ones above.  this is like
wei-hwa's extension C, except i'd rather use my right hand in its "normal"
typing position.

how about a third set, in the middle of the keyboard somewhere, for doing
D-relative things?
