When I read David Singmaster's algorithm in his Notes on Rubik's Magic
Cube I thought his idea of curing the orientations of the edge-piece
before positioning them was a great one, and adopted it in my own
algorithm.  One may be able to get away with only 6 turns to cope with
the orientation, which is quite a gain on the number of turns needed
if one takes the obvious route and orients once the pieces are in
position.

I then went on to apply the same principle to the corner pieces, by
orienting them next, which can be done in 7 or 14 face turns by
selecting the first of the following (for three twists) or the first
followed by the second suitably applied (for two or four twists):

F U2 F' U' F U' F'
L' U2 L U L' U L

These processes, which I mentioned in my last post, move the corner
pieces as well as twist them, and also move the edge pieces but
preserve their orientation.  So, if applied after the edge pieces have
been oriented but not positioned, they get the top face of the cube
the right colour, and it can then be solved by orientation-preserving
moves of the edge and corner pieces.  I may be rather bad at
perceiving patterns, but I find the simplification of having to look
only at the faces of the top-layer pieces that lie in the side faces
of the cube in order to work out what needs to go where enough of an
advantage to make this order of the stages worthwhile even if it did
not take fewer moves in total.
