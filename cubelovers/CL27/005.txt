Here in the northeastern US, high-pressure sodium (Na) vapor lamps are
common; they have a much broader spectrum that the essentially
monochromatic low-pressure lamps. The latter are rather strange! They're
also more efficient, I'm fairly sure. I haven't looked at a cube under
the h.p. lamps, though.
