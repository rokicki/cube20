  Oddly enough, I have been thinking about a method to manipulate a
cube by use of the numeric keypad.  It seems most moves can be
completed rather naturally, but I do not know if it works in practice.

  Anyways, take a keypad like this:

7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3

  This corresponds to a face of a cube quite nicely.  Suppose you
wanted to rotate the right face clockwise.  One could enter 36 or 69,
for example, which you could conceptually think of as the direction
your hand would move to rotate the right face clockwise.  Counter
clockwise would be the other direction.  (96 or 63 or even 93) The
same technique could be applied to the left face or top face or bottom
face.  The middle slices could be rotated just as easil: 52 would rotate
the middle vertical slice down.

  The question is how to effect rotating the front and rear faces.
For me, 19 and 91 seem natural for F and F' because they basically
mimic the twisting motion.  The rear is more troublesome, but perhaps
for symetry 73 and 37 might be used?

  Anyways, that could take care the turns, Cube rotations could be as
simple as a shift followed by a direction.  shift-5-2 might rotate the
cube along the X axis such that U is now F and F is now D, etc...

  I do not know if keypad entry is any more or less prone to these
types of entry, but I think that the general mechanism might work.
