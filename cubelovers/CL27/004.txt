I always had problems solving the cube in bars.  I would always have a
"friend" that would want to drag me into a bar and make money off of my
cube solving skills, but the lighting was always low and I couldn't tell
the colors apart.

Along those lines, I have a brass cube.  Easy to solve, or nearly
impossible?  It is heavy, even though I believe it is only "plated".

I have a picture of it on my web site at:

I also have a "cubo 15" cube you all may find interesting.

Thanks!
