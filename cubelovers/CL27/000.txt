(a) doesn't this depend on the manufacturer?  (b) doesn't taking it
apart at all do that anyway?

I can't see how.  Based on how I saw my cube move as I did this, I
don't believe it's putting significant stress on any of the face-center
cubies.  Remember, what I said to do was to push the wing cubie away
from the corner cubie, not vice versa; the only face cubie anywhere
near the operation is the one you're prying towards, and the wing cubie
is pivoting around that, not prying past it.

After disassembling my cube, I remembered this advice, and tried to get
one of the face centers off.  Even with the cube disassembled, I
desisted for fear of breaking the plastic rather than the glue join.

Perhaps there are multiple production runs in existence and some of
them come apart more easily this way than others?
