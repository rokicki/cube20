Subject: Inventing your own techniques


I've been reading Cube-Lovers e-mail for a few months now and am
enjoying it very much.  It is one of the great benefits of the
Internet that people with a common interest, but spread so far apart,
can so easily communicate like this.

For me, the most fun, and the ultimate challenge, in cubing comes from
figuring out how to solve the puzzle in the first place.  I avoid
published and posted techniques.  I'd really like to hear from people
on this list on how you go about inventing new moves and techniques or
how you feel about learning to solve a puzzle on your own.

I vaguely remember how I learned to solve the 3x3x3 back in the early
80's.  I was in 8th grade at the time; now I'm in 25th grade.
According to my family I quite thoroughly infatuated by the puzzle at
the time.  Solving one side was faily easy and then I was able to get
2 and 3 sides, but with a disorganized and perhaps even random method.

I heard from a friend (who had a solution book) that the key to
solving the top and bottom was a set of special moves that allowed you
to manipulate the bottom corner pieces without affecting the top side.
I set out to find these moves on my own and did.  I would carefully
record the position and orientation of each corner piece, then move a
top corner out of position and then back into position in a different
way and check how the bottom side changed.  This led to a few
sequences which I could repeatedly apply to solve the bottom corners.

The rest was fairly easy, except for the situation in which two edges
were flipped.  I had to have someone show me a move to get past this
point.  I couldn't figure it out.  Otherwise, I had a 50% chance of
solving on any given attempt.

Now I have a 4x4x4 and a 5x5x5 cube as well.  I've been able to solve
these primarily using extensions of the techniques I learned for the
3x3x3 and a few new extras, but only to a point.  I'm now stuck if one
pair of "wing" pieces are switched.  If two pairs are switched, I can
solve it, but not if only one are switched.  Again, I solve it 50% of
the times I set out.

Of course, there was at least on posted solution for this very problem
to this list a couple of weeks ago.  I saved it to a folder just in
case I decide to resort to it, but in the mean time want to figure
this out on my own.

Regards,
Fred Wheeler
