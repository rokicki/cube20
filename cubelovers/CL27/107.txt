Subject: hello to all

	Hey! I just thought I'd drop a line to introduce myself since I've
subscribed to your mailing list. My name is Brian Davis (my friends all
call me "_pink". The underscore is silent.) I live in Athens, Georgia USA
and Manage a Computer Graphics Facility at the Univ of Georgia.
	I have been a cube fanatic since day one... I've got a pretty good
collection and several volumes of notes (as I sure most of you do) but feel
there is still more out there. I have noticed many names here on the Cube
Lovers List that have some wonderful www pages. Maybe I'll find some time
to create a www cube presence of my own that doesn't overlap too much.
(this might be hard to do as you guys have it pretty well wrapped up right
now...)
	I have "e-talked" with Tim Browne some previously (don't blame him
for me being here, he's innocent really) and when I found he was here and
the list seems to still be alive I thought I might as well subscribe.
	I'll start out by sticking my neck out a bit and see if any one
wants to hear some information I have about Square 1 moves or
inner-workings (since I've crushed a few out of curiosity and could take
picts to post on the web) or the mechanics of the Skewb since I've had to
put it back together after an employee dropped it.
	At any rate, I'm glad to be here and will try not to ramble so
incoherently in the future.

btw: anyone have a Siamese Cube that they would like to get rid of? ;) Ok,
how about just answer a few questions about so I can try to construct
one... 8)
