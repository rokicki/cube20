I'm going by what I have observed -- which is mostly Ideal cubes.  The
Ideal Deluxe cube has white opposite blue, as well as their Revenge
and the three normal cubes I have in my collection.  I can check the
orientation of the minicubes in Rubik's Race and the "deluxe-ish"
cube supplied with Rubik's Game.

The 5x5x5 in my collection is also white opposite blue, although it
isn't Ideal (pun intended).

The OddzOn cubes are also blue opposite white, so I think it's safe
to say that the majority of cubes out there are blue opposite white.

 From http://www.rubiks.com/cubesolution_new.html :

>Note: we use the color arrangement of the original Rubik's cube (i.e.
>blue is opposite to green, red is opposite to orange, and yellow is
>opposite to white; if the blue side is on the top, then the red is
>on the left and the yellow on the right, and so on), because this

>since 1995 are colored differently (i.e. blue is opposite to white,
>green is opposite to yellow, and red is opposite to orange).
