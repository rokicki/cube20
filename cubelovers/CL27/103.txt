Subject: Standard file format for Rubik's Cube is just about ready
Date: Fri, 4 Jun 1999 12:14:00 +0100

	Following on from my mail
of the 21st May...

	I have defined a language for writing
down the state of a standard Rubik's cube.
Many people offered suggestions, and I thank
them.

	The language now has its own website:

	http://byrden.com/rubxml/

which contains an online demo program to
read the language and draw the corresponding
cube in "unfolded" format. People who want
to record their "pretty patterns" may find this a
useful resource!

I have one question that I want to ask now. This
language needs a "default colour scheme". I
understand that one way of colouring a Rubik's
Cube was much more common than the others,
but I don't know which one. Can anyone specify it
exactly for me?
