Subject: Re: Lubricant

White lithium grease is pretty good, but I don't know about its long term
effects on plastic. If anyone has ever changed a distributor / points on an
old car, there is a small tube of grease that is intended to be used on a
plastic metal contact point. It is actually absorbed by the plastic and
allows it to remain quite frictionless. If you want some good advice on
this stuff look for an auto parts store with people that know more than
just what they read from the packages or an older mechanic.

[ Moderator's note: Be sure to read the tube or find a MSDS for
  warnings about prolonged contact with skin.  If you can absorb Li+
  from this, it's serious bad news. --Dan ]
