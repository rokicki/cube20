Hello again,
	Thanks to all who sent me a welcoming note.

A few notes of interest:

Dale: Crazy 5 combined cubes man! I might have to try it... Did you also
attach the edge cubes or just the corners?

Chris (or Chris and Kori): I've been to your page(s) many times. Nice site!
I've been to ebay a bit but I'm not giving out my ebay nickname... ;) I
have the Pyramorphix and am not sold on the last pict of my wanted page
being one in scrambled state...

Jared: Thanks for the tip. I'll follow up and let you know what turns up.

Bob Harris: Hey! another Georgian! Glad to see I'm not the only one. I'm
sure we shall be talking a bit...

Noel: If you are talking about the octagonal prism then the answer is just
like the 3x3x3 but if you're talking about the Octahedron (double pyramid)
then unfortunately I cannot help as I have not had the chance to hold one
in my hands...

Hana: Thank you for the wonderful note. I have not had a chance to visit
your site but it will be first on my list when I get home. I am intrigued
to see what you have been doing!

Pete Beck: Did the money order I sent ever arrive? The beachball is a Skewb
of 4 colors (thus the subclass) I contacted Meffert's a few weeks back and
they informed me that the beachball is not in production but they are going
to make more available in October! I have found info on the bandaged cube
but need clearer direction as to which pairs of cubies are 'glued'
together... As for Unknown #2 on my wanted page, when tracing the
dissections I can only imagine a 2x2x2 with non cubed cubies... Who knows...

Others inquired about my Square 1 and Skewb notes. Ok. I'll do a write up
on each under two different posts as to keep things separated. Posts to
follow...

Thanks again to all for making me feel at home.

[ Moderator's note: also Wei-Hwa Huang noted that The "Unknown #1" on
  Pink's web page is just a taped cube. ]
