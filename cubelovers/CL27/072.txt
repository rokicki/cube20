I know how to disassemble it!  First you get it into the original shape that
it comes in, and turn 180 degrees.  Then you twist it about 22 degrees and
pry out one of the dart (edge) pieces.  This can best be seen in a diagram,
and I have a rough sketch at this address:

Once one piece is out, they all come out easily, similar to Rubik's Cube.
Putting it back together is similar-- do the same thing in reverse.  The
mechanism is really neat!
