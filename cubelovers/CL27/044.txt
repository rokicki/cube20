Silicon in its (relatively) pure form is somewhat difficult to get hold
of and probably not a very good lubricant.  You probably mean silicone.

I don't know how well it works - I haven't perceived a need for
lubricants for my Cubes - but one I wouldn't write off without trying
is graphite, available easily and cheaply as pencil lead, the softer
the pencil the better.  The major downside I would expect is black dust
rubbing off on fingers and to a lesser extent everything you set the
Cube down on.  (But it's a kind of black dust that washes off easily.)

[Moderator's note: John Bailey also advises graphite, applied carefully and
 sparingly.]
