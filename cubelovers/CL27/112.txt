Subject: Solution for the size 2 octahedron

After playing with the size 2 corner moves based octahedron, I found that
the solution for most of the edges is trivial, just a matter of putting them
into place using standard puzzle moves.  The only part of the puzzle that
needs a special move is the final step that you may be left with a pair of
faces that need to be switched:

The following represent a tip of the octahedron, and sides A and B must be
switched

     R->
     |
_____|______
     |
  A  |  B


The following move accomplishes this:

Down
Rotate Counterclockwise
Up
Rotate Twice
Down
Rotate Twice
Up
Rotate Twice
Down
Rotate Clockwise

The "Up" and "Down" moves refer to the right half of the octahedron, cut
through the middle of the tip and leaving the left half steady.  The Rotate
moves refer to rotating the tip in place.

Anyone with a good notation for this and the size 3 corners based
octahedron, or the side based size 2 or 3 octrahedra let me know.

[Moderator's note: Isn't a corners-based octahedron just a face-based cube
 with the corners flattened and the faces made pointy?  I think BFTDLR or
 BFUDLR would work for notation. --Dan]
