Subject: Different versions of the Ideal cube

Recently I've acquired a couple of older cubes from ebay.  One was sold as
"the original rubik's cube" by Ideal.  When I opened it up I noticed that
the quality was not the same as my original cube that I bought in 1980 or
so.  The stickers were not as bright for one thing.  On my "original" cube
the orange stickers are almost fluorescent, whereas on this version the
color is dull, and its not a faded version of the original color.  Its
clearly a different shade of orange.  The yellow and green colors are not as
bright.

And then there is the center white sticker.  On some older Ideal cubes there
is a logo on it, on this one I just got the logo was a separate decal.  On
my 1980's cube there is no logo at all.

Next we come to differences in the actual pieces.  On some Ideal cubes the
cubies are solid, well, probably hollow in the center, but there is no
openining.  But on others there is an opening.

Does anyone know anything about the history of the Ideal cube?  Were there
different runs of production?  Did they start "cutting corners" to lower
cost?  Is there any way to tell from the packaging, which cube is the
version that has the nice bright colors?

Sorry if this has been discussed in the past, I'm relatively new to this
list...

[ Moderator: The archives have quite a bit about various types of
  cubes.  Are you sure the open-corner cubes were from Ideal?  I
  thought those were the pirated knockoffs. ]
