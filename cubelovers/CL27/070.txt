Hey there. I've got a problem with my Square-1 puzzle. A few days ago, I
got a whole bunch of sugar grains stuck inside which are screwing up the
mechanism big time. At first it seemed as though the it was getting better
as the sugar was ground down and flushed out during each rotation, but now
it's getting affected by the dampness and the sugar's turning into a
pretty decent adhesive. The only real solution seems to be to take the
puzzle apart, clean it, dry it, and reassemble it. Someone on rec.puzzles
suggested soaking it in water, but given that the stickers are laminated
paper instead of plastic and the possibility of rusting the mechanism, I'd
rather not do this. Besides, I'd really like to see the internal workings
of this Machiavellian torture machine. :-) If anyone on this list knows
how to disassemble/reassemble the puzzle, I'd really appreciate it if you
could let me know how to do it. :-) Thanks in advance. L8r.
