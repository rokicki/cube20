Subject: Cube program by Roger Broadie

I'd like to say that the cube program from Mr. Broadie is quite nice,
actually is something I have been searching for for a while and something I
requested to several Web based cube programers and never found, the ability
to have a sequence interfase is something very useful mostly when you are
looking for patterns and you find these lists on the web that don't show the
actual result but just describe it with some sort of complicated notation,
trying to do it with a real cube is a real pain since you have to do all the
moves and if you make a mistake you have to start all over again by solving
the cube and then making the moves that would take you to the final pattern.
Well done Mr. Broadie and keep up the good work, please let the list know
when you have the Windows version  ready. ;-)
