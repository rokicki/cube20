Subject: Optimal solver for Windows now available

I finished my optimal solver program for Windows now. It optimizes the
maneuvers written to the output file of the Cube Explorer program.

I am quite satisfied with the performance. I searches 1,100,000 nodes
per second on a P350. 90MB of RAM should be enough (though I run it on a
machine with 256MB). A depth 17 search on random cubes typically takes
less than one hour. I made a test run with 10 random cubes and optimal
solutions for all of them were found within 35 hours (6 had length 18
and 4 had lenght 17).

The exe file and the source code are available at
