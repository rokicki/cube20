I just got back from Target & saw a new Rubik's product.  It is a 2x2x2
puzzle of Darth Maul's head! (he's from Star Wars: Episode 1)  It comes
in the usual cardboard & plastic box except it is colored in Black &
red.  I think it is $14.99.

I haven't had a chance to buy one and try out the mechanism though,
because I spent all my money hoarding the action figures....

May the force be with you...
