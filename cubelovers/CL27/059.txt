Subject: RE: Lubricant

	I used to use silicone grease of the type used for O-ring seals in
diving equipment, etc.  I haven't seen any damage caused by this.  WD-40 has
also been suggested and I have used it, but I think it may damage some
plastics.  Note that the central spindle is often made of a different plastic
than the other pieces and I think it is more subject to attack by some of the
lubricants.
