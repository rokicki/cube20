On what point does the Spratt wrench fail?  That's always been my
favored edge-flipper.  (On the 3-Cube, that is; when solving a
dodecehedral puzzle I bought from Mr. Bandelow, I was forced to develop
other edge-flippers, and the one I ended up with maps easily onto the
Cube.  In 3-Cube terms, it's based on R F' R' F, which induces a
3-cycle (fr,fd,dr) on edges.  By applying this, rotating the cube 120 degrees
about its rfd-lbu long diagonal, and applying the inverse, you can get
a two-edge flipper at the price of disturbing four corners.  The
dodecahedron I solve by doing edges first with this procedure, then
using (the dodecehedral analog of) (R F' R' F) 3, which leaves edges
alone and produces two corner swaps, to fix up the corners.  But when
solving the 3-Cube, I still find the Spratt wrench more convenient.)

What I'd like is a puzzle like the dodecahedron, but with an additional
turning mode: 72 degrees on a cut through the center.  The puzzle as it stands
has face-cut lines that make it clear such turns are conceivable,
though designing a mechanism for them would be interesting.  Perhaps
when we get force-reflecting datagloves.... :-)
