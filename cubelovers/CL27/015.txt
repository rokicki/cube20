I had some ideas on this once. The first keyboard layout below is easier
to learn but the second would be faster once you had mastered it.

[QWERTY keyboard]

1)

U = r
U'= u
D'= f
D = j

R = 7
R'= m
L'= 4
L = v

F = h
F'= g
B'= y
B = t

2)

Any mappings using this set of keys:

  er  ui
asdf  jkl;

The simulator input key should be configurable so you can try out these
variations once its written. If you want help implementing it, feel free
to ask me - just in case I ever have some free time on my hands!
