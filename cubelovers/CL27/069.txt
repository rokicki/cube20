My apologies for leaving out a couple of things in my note about conjugation
and commutators.  But if I hadn't left them out, I doubt that we would have
received Dan's very nice little message about rightward and leftward
composition.

I should have mentioned the rightward vs. leftward composition issue. As Dan
points out, it is certainly the case that Y'XY can be correct in one book while
YXY' can be correct in another.  However, what I *meant* to say was that I had
seen books in which (unless I was missing something obvious) the author's
definition of conjugation did not correspond to the author's composition
direction.

All I was really trying to say was that irrespective of the author's chosen
direction, YXY' and Y'XY are both conjugates.  It's just that in one case, you
have the conjugate of X by Y and in the other you have the conjugate of X by
Y', and which is which depends on the right vs. left system the author is using.

I cited the reason "X shifted by Y" as a reason for preferring the conjugate of
X by Y to be Y'XY in the Cube-Lovers system.  I should also have mentioned the
homomorphism vs. antihomomorhism issue.  There are two reasons for preferring
Y'XY to YXY' for the conjugate of X by Y in the Cube-Lovers system, and
regrettably I only mentioned one of them.  Homomorphism is the other.

Dan covered the homomorphism issue extremely well, so I would like to make some
additional comments about the "X shifted by Y" interpretation of conjugation.

Let us suppose that we have a maneuver

    A = L2 F2 L2 U  L' R B R2 D2 R2 B' L R' U'

which flips the uf cubie and the df cubie while leaving the rest of the cube
unchanged (the rest of the cubies are said to be fixed by A). The uf and df
cubies are the edge cubies which are in the middle of the top row and the
middle of the bottom row of the front face, respectively. (The given maneuver
for A is minimal in the face turn metric, but the exact maneuver doesn't matter
for our purposes.)

Suppose that instead we want to flip the ul cubie and the df cubie.  A maneuver
which will do so is U'AU.  The U' move brings the ul cubie into the uf cubie's
place while leaving the df cubie where it was.  The A maneuver flips the
*contents* of the uf cubicle which is now the ul cubie and flips the df cubie
as usual.  The U moves returns the (now flipped) ul cubie to the ul cubicle.

We might write the actions of the A maneuver as follows:

     A:  uf ->  fu  (flips the uf cubie)
         df ->  fd  (flips the df cubie)

We might write the actions of the U  and U' moves on the edge cubies as follows:

     U:  uf ->  ul          U':  uf -> ur
         ul ->  ub               ur -> ub
         ub ->  ur               ub -> ul
         ur ->  uf               ul -> uf

Hence, if we just consider the AU part of U'AU, we have that the uf cubie goes
to fu which in turn goes to lu.  (If U performs uf -> ul, then it equivalently
performs fu -> lu).  So the uf cubie is carried to the ul cubicle and flipped
to be lu.  This is the general idea of what we want (to flip the cubie which is
in the ul cubicle), but it is the wrong cubie in the ul cubicle.  So preceding
AU by U' "cancels" the movement of the cubie (and also the movement of all the
other cubies) and retains only the flip of the cube.  The net result is that the
cubie which is flipped is shifted from being the uf cubie to being the ul cubie,
as desired.  A is shifted by U, which is what we wanted.

It should be clear that UAU' flips the ur and the df cubies.  UAU' flips the ur
rather than the uf cubie, which we can describe as saying that A has been
shifted by U'.

Essentially any two edge cubies can be flipped by variations on this basic
theme.  Our next example will involve whole cube moves.  We denote the whole
cube move of grasping the right face and turning the whole cube clockwise and
counterclockwise by c_R and c_R', respectively.  So c_R' would bring the bu and
fu cubies into the uf and df cubicles (respectively), A would flip them, and
c_R would return them to their original locations.  The net result is that the
maneuver (c_R' A c_R) flips the bu and the fu cubies.

It is standard on Cube-Lovers to denote the 24 rotations of the cube by C, and
we might write a C-conjugate as c'Ac where c is some fixed but arbitrary
element of C.  c_R and c_R' are just two particular elements of C.  Working
with a real cube, you probably wouldn't even think about C-conjugation in this
particular context  --  you would just do it.  That is, if your hands knew how
to perform the A maneuver to flip the uf and df cubies, and if you needed to
flip two edge cubies which were on opposite sides of the same face, you would
just rotate the whole cube in space to bring the two cubies which needed to be
flipped into the uf and df locations and then you would perform the A maneuver
--  simpler to do than to describe.

It is more common on Cube-Lovers to talk about M-conjugation than to talk about
C-conjugation, where M is the group of 24 rotations and 24 reflections of the
cube.  C is a subgroup of M.  So c_R and c_R' just as well elements of M as
they are of C, and our (c_R' A c_R) maneuver is a good example of
M-conjugation.  M-conjugation lets us deal with reflections in addition to
rotations, which in effect means it let's us treat clockwise and
counterclockwise moves as equivalent when appropriate for symmetry purposes.

But when we are dealing with whole cube rotations of a real cube, we are just
dealing with C-conjugation.  In the case of our A maneuver, C-conjugation means
that c'Ac lets us flip any two cubies anywhere on the cube which are opposite
edge cubies on the same face of the cube.

Finally, whole cube rotations are a convenient way to apply the maneuver A to
any face of a real cube.  But mathematically, we really do not have to perform
whole cube rotations.  We can use C-conjugation (and more generally,
M-conjugation) to apply the "same" maneuver to a different face.  Consider
again (c_R' A c_R).  If we write out A, we get

     c_R' (L2 F2 L2 U  L' R B R2 D2 R2 B' L R' U') c_R

But the maneuver (c_R c_R') is equal to the identity, so we can insert it between
each face move thusly.

    c_R' L2 (c_R c_R') F2 (c_R c_R') L2 (c_R c_R') U (c_R c_R')  etc.

Now, we can re-associate thusly so that we have the c_R-conjugate of each face
turn.

    (c_R' L2 c_R) (c_R' F2 c_R) (c_R' L2 c_R) (c_R' U c_R) etc.

Finally, if we actually perform the calculations, we discover that conjugation
by c_R leaves L, L', L2, R, R', and R2 alone; it takes F, F', and F2 to U, U',
and U2, respectively; it takes U, U', and U2 to B, B', and B2, respectively;,
it takes B, B', and B2 to D, D', and D2, respectively; and it takes D, D', and
D2 to F, F', and F2, respectively.  Hence, conjugation by r_C gives us a
maneuver to flip the bu and fu cubies thusly.

            A = L2 F2 L2 U  L' R B R2 D2 R2 B' L R' U' (flip uf and df)
   c_R' A C_R = L2 U2 L2 B  L' R D R2 F2 R2 D' L R' B' (flip bu and fu)
