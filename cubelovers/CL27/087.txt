The reason that "negative turning" is necessary is because the prior
turn did not get the faces lined up exactly.  Let's look at the sequence
"R U".  You turn the right face a quarter turn, then you turn the upper
face a quarter turn.  If you make the R turn a fraction of inch too far,
then the cube will correct itself when you try to make the U turn.  But
if you make the R turn a fraction of an inch too short, the upper face
will lock if you first try to turn it clockwise.  The "negative turn"
doesn't lock up because it is counterclockwise.  When you then start to
turn the U face counterclockwise it straightens up the R face so that
the U face is free to turn in either direction.

"Negative turning" is sometimes necessary, but a better solution is to
always either overturn or underturn by a fraction of an inch depending
on which way you plan on making the next turn.  So if you are planning
on turning "R U", make sure your "R" is a fraction of an inch past a
quarter turn, but if you are planning to turn "R U'", make sure your "R"
is a fraction of an inch short of a quarter turn.
