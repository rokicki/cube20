I have finished the last touches on JPuzzler, the Java port for Puzzler for
Windows.  Many people with other operating systems asked if I was going to
port the program and well, this is it.

Speed is an issue.  The program runs very well on a PPro200 or better, but I
believe the video card that is used makes the biggest difference because on
a PII-300 with a basic video card the program ran slower.

JPuzzler was written in 100% pure Java so it should work on any Java
compatible browser but for now it has only been tested on Netscape 4.5+ and
Internet Explorer 4+.  I don't have access to other hardware, so I am
particularly interested in hearing from players with Macintosh computers, or
any flavour of XWindows.

All 17 puzzles from Puzzler are implemented and I will probably add more in
the future; suggestions and criticism are welcome.
