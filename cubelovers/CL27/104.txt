The most common color scheme was
 White opposite Blue,
 Green opposite Yellow,
 Red opposite Orange.
 If you hold Yellow as Front and Red as Up, then Blue is Right.

Color "purists" have complained about this, preferring
 White opposite Yellow,
 Blue opposite Green,
 Red opposite Orange.
 -- note that each pair is the same color except for some "Yellow" added.

If all my friends jumped off a cliff... what reason is there for me to live?

[Moderator's note: You say white opposite blue was common, but when
 was that?  My experience and other reports lead me to believe that
 what you call the "purist" color scheme was most common in 1985 (viz
 _Rubik's_Cubic_Compendium_) and I don't recall seeing any change
 since.  It also is reportedly most common in the chirality you
 describe, which is called the BOY version because blue, orange, and
 yellow appear in that order clockwise around a corner.  The mirror
 image coloring is called YOB (a Cockney term for a yokel).  I don't
 know of any cute naming schemes for the enantiomorphs in color
 schemes in which the blue, orange, and yellow faces do not all
 meet--Dan ]
