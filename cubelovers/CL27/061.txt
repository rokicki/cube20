When I learned how to solve the cube (some 20 years back, I think...),
I was taught a layer-by-layer solution, consisting of 'modular' moves.
Most of the modularity occurs on the 3rd layer, namely:
- In flipping the edges, I use (RE)^4 to flip the UR edge. Then, I move
  the top layer so that there's another edge to be flipped at the UR
  position and I repeat the same procedure.
- In rotating the edges, I was taught the above-mentioned {R,F]^2 to
  rotate an edge by 120 degrees. Later, I 'discovered' that [F,R]^2
  does the same thing backward.

Most other layer-by-layer methods I've seen have formulas to flip 2
edges in the top layer, but you'll need two for the different confi-
gurations. Also, these methods mostly have two, three or more formulas
to rotate the edges in the toplayer, depending on configuration.

My method may not be the fastest around (it takes me about 2 minutes
to solve The Cube), but I don't need many formulas for it:

1st layer: on my own (make a cross, fill in the corners)
2nd layer: 2 formulas (standard layer 3 to layer 2 swing, two directions)
3rd layer: 4 (exchange edges, flip one edge, exchange corners, rotate
           one corner)
