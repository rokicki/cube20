Subject: repairing broken cubes

I recently broke one of the face cubies of my 4X4.  I attempted to
repair it by drilling a hole for a pin and gluing it together (it broke
in the "ankle" that holds the "foot" to the top.)  I tried several
different types of glues and epoxies and nothing seemed to stick very
well.  I finally used some woodworkers glue and it is holding together
for now.  I'm being very carefull and cannot do any fast moves with it.
Does anyone know of a better way to repair these types of breaks.  I
would not have attempted the repair at all if the cubes were still
readily available, but since they are out of production I have little
choice.  This is the second 4X4 I've broken in this manner.
