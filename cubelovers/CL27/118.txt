Subject: Square 1 Notes

Greetings to all,

	Ok, I've been extreeeeeemely busy as of late but I did find a few
mins at lunch today to throw together some of my notes on the Square 1
puzzle.
	First my standard disclaimers:

1.) The web page design and layout for getting the Square 1 back to cube
shape have been stolen directly from Christian Eggermont. My notes were
very similar but I liked his presentation much better than mine. The only
thing I have done to his notes was to rearrange the classification of
shapes as to their 'distance' from cube shape. To see his original work
please refer to:

http://web.inter.nl.net/C.Eggermont/

2.) I expanded on Andrew Arensburger's cube preserving formulas and also
adopted his piece notation system. To see his original work please refer to:

http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~arensb/Square1/

3.) Some formula were revised and expanded upon from Richard Snyder's
Square 1 Solution Book. Nice book but sometimes a bit cryptic.

4.) I know that there has to be some errors in my notes. If you find them
please advise me so that I might make the corrections necessary. (Actually
now that I think about it, I believe that in the Edge moves section there
is a mistake where I say to turn the bottom 30deg in one direction but it
would make an impossible Right turn... if you see this just turn the bottom
the other direction... I'll try to find it and correct it asap)

5.) There are 2 or 3 pages of blank diagrams or unfinished notes that
indavertantly got included. Please disregard anything that looks unusual...
(hopefully that won't be every page you look at...) ;)

	Ok, so if you're not asleep by now you can hit

http://128.192.40.238/pink/SquareList.html

for the shapes list as to get from where you are now back to cube shape.
There is a link at the bottom of that page to 3 PDF files. One to
manipulate Corners, one for Edges and one for my initial thoughts on 2x2x2
cycling of Square 1 quadrants. I hope there is some info of use for
somebody.
	And as always... feedback is very welcome.

later all,
_pink
