Subject: Speed cubing

	A UK TV program is looking for a speedy cubist.  I suppose anything
under a minute would be considered speedy.  Is there anyone in the UK who has
this kind of current speed?  If so, could they email  chrisit@seventowns.com 
and send a copy to me since I've had some other possible inquiries.
