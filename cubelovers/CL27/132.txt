  Thanks to Chris's post, and his web page, I found a new shop
in Germany for twist-to-solve puzzles.  It is

Hendrik Haak's Puzzle Shop  http://www.puzzle-shop.de/

  Has anyone in the group ordered from this shop and what
have been your results?  I especially like the looks of the
dogic, octagon, mozaika, and octaedercube puzzles.  Has anyone
tried these, and does anyone have pictures of them in mid-twist,
on their web pages?

  Thanks for any info.

Howard Drake
