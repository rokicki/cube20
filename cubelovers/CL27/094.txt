Have you customised your cube?

If so please let me know what you have done to it to make it run
faster, smoother etc.

We will pay for this information.

Thanks and look forward to hearing from you

[Moderator's note: This is more hucksterish than I usually pass
 through to cube-lovers, but in case anyone wants to know who's in the
 cube biz, this is one of them.  She also wants to buy Rubik's Revenges.
 (Who doesn't?  I've gotten a dozen such requests, either ignored or
 answered with the explanation that no one is selling them now except
 in one-off auctions.  Be sure to let cube-lovers know if that changes.)

 Anyway, this is Chrisi's ad; if you want to read more ads from her,
 her addresses are above; the ads won't run on cube-lovers. --Dan ]
