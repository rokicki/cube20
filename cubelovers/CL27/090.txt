Sorry to say (because it's no longer made), the Deluxe Cube from
Ideal had differently-shaped details inside so that with moderate
amounts of misalignment, it would self-align as you began a move. It
also had plastic colored tiles attached.

"Negative" turning seemed to be unnecessary if you used ordinary
care, but I wasn't trying for speed.
