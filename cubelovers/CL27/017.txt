Hello-

We talked in the past about Oddzon (Current distributor of Rubik's Products
for Seven Towns - the holder of the Rubik's brand) and the version of the
Rubik's Cube on the market.  If you are tired of those stickers that fall
apart and would like a well built cube...one that has a sprung indexing
mechanism which would mean that a layer would gently "click" into place
when aligned along with tiles instead of stickers, then it's time for you
to place your vote and influence them.  They are currently looking into
making a "Deluxe" Rubik's Cube, but, need to see if the market will support
such a product.  Anyway, you can place your vote at the following link:

Be sure to browse their web site while you are there.  Check out their news
link to find out more on the production of the "Deluxe" Rubik's Cube.

Happy Cubing!
