WD-40 will make it stick REALLY badly! Please don't do it.  Not
because it will dissolve the plastic (although it might), but because
it's too thin. Also I have seen in the past a problem with the kind of
solvents in this kind of product where it seems to 'realise' any small
cracks in plastic, causing it to just fall to bits the next day.
Silicone grease sounds good to me.

[ Moderator's note: I'll remind you that last month Alex Montilla
  suggested (for low-quality tiled cubes), "If you use WD-40, it'll
  eat away at the plastic resulting in really smooth turning.  It'll
  be great for about 3-4 weeks of daily cubing, but the WD-40 will
  take its toll, and the cube will start falling apart.  But for a few
  bucks every 3-4 weeks is worth it to me."  So WD-40 is bad for the
  cube, but possibly good for the turning, at least temporarily.
  That's the way the cubie crumbles.  --Dan ]
