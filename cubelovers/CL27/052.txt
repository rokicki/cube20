 In the US there exists a magazine called, "Inventor's Digest"  which
 I have a subscribtion to and which is currently running a series of
 articles about building prototypes from molds.  It would probably be
 just what you are looking for.  It explains the whole process.  If you
 want, I can get subscription information for you or information on how
 to order individual articles.  You may wish to look in your local
 library to see if they carry the magazine (au = australia?) but I'm
 not sure your country would carry it.  If you want I will send you
 excerpts just ask.  (is this something the whole list would want to find
 out about?)

[ Moderator's note: I doubt we have that many molder/fabricator people
  on the list (but I could be wrong).  It's also somewhat questionable
  how large typed-in excerpts can be before we run into copyright
  problems.  So I'd suggest people who are looking for excerpts should
  contact Douglas Zander at the above address.  Subscription/ordering
  information is more generally useful and less problematic, so please
  send cube-lovers that info. --Dan ]
