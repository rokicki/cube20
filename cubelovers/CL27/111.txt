Subject: Q: fix a pyramorphix?
To: cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu (cube)

Hello, I wonder if anyone can help me.  I allowed a friend of mine to
play with my pyramorphix and it broke in his hands.  One of the inner
pieces broke apart.  It was the piece that sits on the dowel with four
little rods sticking up.  Does anyone know if any local (USA) shop fixes
this particular puzzle?  Does Meffert's Puzzle & Games fix them in Hong
Kong?  (I'd prefer a local shop)  Does anyone have a broken pyramorphix
they would sell me a piece to replace mine?  :-)   Thanks for any help.
(Is Meffert the inventor of the pyramorphix?)
