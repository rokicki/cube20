Hi all,

I've been having some marathon cubing sessions lately, and sometimes my
wrists, fingers, or forearms would hurt.  It's really hard to stop
because I'm so addicted, but I have to because I'm scared I might get
carpal tunnel syndrome or some sort of repetitive stress problem.  I
love computers, and since I'm studying computer science, and because
I'll have many many hours on a keyboard ahead of me, this scares me even
more.  Does anyone else have have this problem?  Any advice?  Thanks.

[ Moderator's note: Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw is mentioned in Singmaster's
  notes as being one of the first to develop cubist's thumb; Roger
  Frye also got a wrist sprain as he mentioned on this list in 1981.
  Repetitive stress injury is nothing to play with, and continuing
  only makes recovery take longer, so stop now! Switch to a simulator.
  Simulators I've seen are somewhat less convenient to use than a real
  cube (though I haven't seen the recent ones), but if that's the case
  I hope this motivates you to change that sorry state. -- Dan ]
