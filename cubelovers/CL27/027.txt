If anybody wants a SpaceOrb 360 (for experimentation please, I generally
don't just give away stuff out of the kindness of my heart, although
that's not unknown either) just drop me an email with a mailing
address.  I still have the box around here somewhere, just don't
remember where.  If I dig around long enough I know I can find the
instructions too.  I don't have it in front of me, but I'm sure it's
just a serial device like a mouse.
