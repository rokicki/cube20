[ Moderator's note: Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw is mentioned in Singmaster's
  notes as being one of the first to develop cubist's thumb; Roger
  Frye also got a wrist sprain as he mentioned on this list in 1981.
  Repetitive stress injury is nothing to play with, and continuing
  only makes recovery take longer, so stop now! Switch to a simulator.
  Simulators I've seen are somewhat less convenient to use than a real
  cube (though I haven't seen the recent ones), but if that's the case
  I hope this motivates you to change that sorry state. -- Dan ]


As a programmer, I am no stranger to repetitive stress related aches and
pains.  I even had cubist's thumb way back :)  My simulator, puzzler, has
mainly a mouse interface and this given enough time can cause you to be
rather sore as well.  I was wondering if anyone had an idea for a "hands on
keyboard" approach that would allow you to naturally move the puzzles'
slices.

There is a macro interface for the cubes to enter moves in UDFBLR notation,
but I am thinking of something that you could, with practice, manipulate a
cube in realtime using a keyboard.

Any ideas would be appreciated and I'll try my best to implement the best
one.  If simulators "felt" like a cube when you used them they would be more
fun (and move without jamming etc)
