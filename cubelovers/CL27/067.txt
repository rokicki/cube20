I concur with Marius.  I used to practice solving underwater in my swimming
pool, back when I averaged 33 seconds!  I would use a cube with just a small
amount of vaseline.  After taking the cube out and letting it dry a couple
hours, it would turn VERY WELL.  Also, the deleterious effect on the plastic
seems to be negligible, as I still have those same cubes and they still
operate smoothly some 15+ years later.
