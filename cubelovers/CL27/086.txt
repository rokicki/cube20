Subject: "Negative" Turning
Message-Id: <11000-3733527C-9578@postoffice-123.bryant.webtv.net>

When the cube locks up on me, I have to turn the layer in the opposite
of the desired direction anywhere from a little jiggle to over 90 degrees in
order to straighten out the pieces.  I'm sure all of you have to do this
too.  I'm calling it "negative" turning.  Is there another term for
this?  I do this rather unconsciously now.

All this locking up wastes time, especially with numerous unsuccessful
efforts.  I'm guessing when fractions of seconds count, time spent
fixing could be spent doing more turns.

I'm wondering, do any of you perform negative turning before starting
any turns to prevent a lock up before it starts rather than try and fix
it after it happens?  Or do you incorporate these negative movements
within combos in anticipation of frequent sticky situations?  When
practicing frequently used combos I have incorporated negative turns
into them with some success.  Does anyone do this to all moves?  It
would take a long time to achieve this w/ all of my combos, so I'm
looking for someone who has.  Would it take longer to do combos w/
negative moves "built in", or just fix the problem when in comes.  Or
maybe there is someone out there who makes turns so accurately he never
experiences this.

Thanks.
