To my fellow cube-lovers:

Josef Jelinek and I have made a web page devoted to the cube. He
contributed cube solution algorithms, accompanied by graphics and I
contributed 12 of my 3-dimensional designs, many of them recent. That
means they were constructed after my book was published in 1997. I also
sketch another problem resulting from these designs, that of fractals.
You may find all this in our URL: http://cube.misto.cz.

Any comments, criticism, etc would be appreciated. I still did not get
my question answered, either by you or by the search engines. It is
this: Is there anyone, on or off the web, who has created something
similar to what I have done? I know about the people at Wunderland, and
have seen thir work; however, what I have done is different.

Thank you very much for any input you can provide.
Hana M. Bizek
