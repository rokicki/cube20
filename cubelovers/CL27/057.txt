Subject: RE: Re : Re: Inventing your own techniques

	The technique of solving the cube by use of commutators and conjugates
is what most people worked out in the early days.  However, I can testify that
it took us some time to realise that one could use second level commutation.
That is, FRF'R' = [F,R] only affects seven pieces, but in fact it only affects
one piece in the L face, so taking the commutator with the L face produces a
3-cycle of corners.  Likewise  [F,R]^2  only twists one corner in the L face
and combining it with turns of L allows you to twist three corners the same way
or two corners opposite ways.
