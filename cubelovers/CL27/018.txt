I fought with this issue back in about 1985 when I was originally working on
the 2x2x2 and the corners of the 3x3x3.  I created a data base for each, with a
program which would allow you to manipulate the cube on the screen, and the
program would always show you your exact distance from Start.  Actually, the
screen would show you two renderings of the cube  --  one was the cube you were
manipulating and the other was the representative of the same cube under
reduction by symmetry.  It was the representative that was looked up in the
data base.

I tried all kinds of input mappings, none of which were very satisfying.  One
obvious thing to try is U for Up, D for Down, etc., but on a QWERTY keyboard
this is not very easy to deal with.

Keyboards in 1985 only had a numeric pad, not the additional arrow and page
up/down keys of modern keyboards.  Within the numeric pad, I ended up using up
arrow for U, down arrow for D, right arrow for R, and left arrow for L.  That
left the question of F and B.  It *sounds* kind of dumb, but using the
numeric pad + key for B and the numeric pad 0/INS key for F worked about as
well as anything.  With these mappings, I could manipulate the cube without
looking at the keyboard and with very little movement of my hand.

I used the shift keys for things like U' and U2.  So left shift plus up arrow
was U' and right shift plus up arrow was U2, etc.  I read the shift keys
directly from the keyboard hardware (this was early DOS, and you could do such
things).  I wouldn't necessarily recommend accessing the hardware so directly
these days.  However, I found that I almost never used the shift keys.  Rather,
I would tap the up arrow key quickly three times for U', and I would tap the up
arrow key quickly two times for U2.

I did not implement an interface for whole cube moves.  Rather, to rotate the
whole cube I would do something like RL' or R'L or UD' etc.  Well, this
works for the 2x2x2, but not for the corners of the 3x3x3.

It's tricky to make the interface simple and intuitive, and also to make it
functionally rich at the same time.
