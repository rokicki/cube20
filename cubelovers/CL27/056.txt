Subject: Rubiks Cube, Megaminx and Square-1 

Is there a world record for the the 4x4x4 and the 5x5x5 rubiks cubes?
If so what is it?

I was wondering what in your opinion is the hardest rubiks like cube
available right now.

On a web page several people from rated the greatest to least in
difficulty:

1)square-1
2)megaminx
3)5x5x5
4)4x4x4
5)?
6)?

Anyway it went something like that.

Would you consider Square-1 one of the hardest cubes to do? If so would
this be considered good of me to learn all by myself? My best time is
83 sec. As if now I am not sure what my average is.  Do you know of
a world record for Square-1 or any good websites? Do you know what an
average would be for the best time?

I was wondering how this compares to others times and accomplishments. At
http://byrden.com/puzzles/ I almost figured out the megaminx. I got
everything except the last row. Is the Megaminx one of the hardest
Rubiks like puzzles available? After I get bored of my 5x5x5 that I
ordered thinking about buying the megaminx. Do you know of a world record
on the megaminx? What would be a average time (perhaps 3-4 minutes?)

Currently I am more interested in the Rubiks cube. Lately I have been
trying to improve my time. I have a personal record of 50 seconds, and
an average time of about 80 seconds. However, I learned how to do the cube
all by myself. I didn't get help from others, websites, books...
I was wondering If you learned by yourself or if you got help? Then what
is your time?

I don't believe that I will ever get much faster. Learning by yourself
is a really hard task. I was wondering if there is any one out there who
agrees that getting help from resources is cheating?

In my opinion they make the people who haved learned by themselves look
bad. This is just my opinion, you don't have to agree.

If you are not sure of answers that's fine. Then do you know of any good
websites I can go to?

Thank you very much.
