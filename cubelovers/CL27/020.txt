Or a extension of your scheme might be to combine arrow keys with the
keypad, in a two-handed approach.

I.e. 6^ or 6v rather than 36 or 69; no order dependence this way.
(Likewise, I find the arrow keys more mnemomic.)  The model is that you're
"grabbing" the specified cubie and rotating it in the specified direction.

In its most natural form, this assumes that the numeric key-pad and the
arrow keys are separate (as they are on my keyboard), although one could
certainly use some other set of "directional" keys aside from the standard
arrow keys.

And as I say, this also assumes --most naturally, although not
necessarily-- a two-handed approach.

For completeness, too, there is also the slice between the front and back
face.

Rather than muddy the paradigm, perhaps other (non-assigned) keys should
be used.

The handy "0" key might make a natural candidate for the front face.

On the other hand since the back face and middle slice are rather
"pathological" cases in this paradigm, might it perhaps make sense to use
keys "outside" the model?  For example "R" and "M".  (Or, less
mnemonically --and depending on the set-up of your keyboard-- "/" or "*"
or ".", which on my keyboard are right beside the numeric keypad keys.)

(For these last cases, perhaps on the <- and -> keys should by
operational.  The up and down arrows being less meaningful here.)

This seems like a good scheme.
