Hi,

This is a very interesting problem.  I've been scratching my head for a
while, and I've cooked up with a keyboard combination that could work
for virtual speed cubing.  I tried to follow a few guidelines: speed
cubing friendly; ergonomic and intuitive.

There are of course, two types of rotations that are required to solve
the cube: body rotations (rotate the whole cube) and slice rotations
(rotate individual faces).  For each type of rotation there are three
additional sub-types.  For body rotations, there are three axes x, y
and z.  For slice rotations, there are 1/4-turn clockwise, 1/4-turn
counterclockwise and 1/2-turn.

Let's define the three body axes as follows: the z-axis will intersect
the U and D faces.  The x-axis will intersect the F and B faces. The
y-axis will intersect the R and L faces.

 Okay, now ergonomics.  When I solve the cube, I notice that my left
hand does most of the body rotations and my right hand does most of the
slice rotations.  I tried to keep this intuition in assigning keyboard
keys by making the left hand perform body rotations and the right hand
perform slice rotations (well, sort of...).  The most intuitive form
that I could think of for your hands to be in is the fetal or "clawed"
position.  This can be satisfied by placing the left-hand fingers on
the A, W, E and F keys and right-hand fingers on the J, I, O and ; keys
(assuming a QWERTY keyboard layout).  To be speed cubing friendly,
these 8 fingers should never have to leave these keyboard key
assignments.
__________________________________________________________________________________
For body rotations, the keyboard key assignments could be:
F - clockwise body rotation about the y-axis (i.e. if we were rotating
    a face it would be R)
E - clockwise body rotation about the x-axis (i.e. if we were rotating
    a face it would be F)
W - clockwise body rotation about the z-axis (i.e. if we were rotating
    a face it would be U)

To perform a counter-clockwise body rotation, hit the SPACEBAR key with
the right thumb in combination with the key assigment (e.g. F and
SPACEBAR)
__________________________________________________________________________________
For the slice rotations, the keyboard 2-key assignments could be:
F and J - 1/4-turn clockwise of the L-face
F and I - 1/4-turn clockwise of the R-face
F and O - 1/4-turn clockwise of R-face and 1/4-turn counterclockwise of
the L-face

E and J - 1/4-turn clockwise of the F-face
E and I - 1/4-turn clockwise of the B-face
E and O - 1/4-turn clockwise of the F-face and 1/4-turn
counterclockwise of the B-face

W and J - 1/4-turn clockwise of the U-face
W and I - 1/4-turn clockwise of the D-face
W and O - 1/4-turn clockwise of the U-face and 1/4-turn
counterclockwise of the D-face

To perform 1/4-turn counterclockwise slice rotations, hit the SPACEBAR
key with the right thumb in combination with the 2-key assignment (e.g.
F and J and SPACEBAR)

To perform 1/2-turn slice rotations, hit the N key with the right thumb
in combination with the 2-key assignment
(e.g. F and J and N)
__________________________________________________________________________________
I've ordered the keys in order of their importance.  As you can see the
J key is responsible for "LEFT-LIKE" slice rotations
I key is responsible for "RIGHT-LIKE" slice rotations
O key is responsible for middle slice rotations

You might ask, why make O the middle slice and not I, since it's the
middle key?  Well, when you actually solve the cube, you never move the
middle slice.  You only move the left and right slices to effectively
move the middle slice.  Furthermore, this operation is performed much
more seldomly than normal R and L slice rotations.

Anyways, you can see with this keyboard mapping you only need a total
of  8 keys to perform all of possible rotations you need to solve the
cube.

If we really want to make this speed cubing friendly we could also do
the following:
-body rotations should be performed in real-time; the speed of rotation
should be an adjustable constant that the user can tweak to his or her
preference
-slice rotations should be instantaneous.  There's really no point in
watching a slice rotate.  Just wasting time...
