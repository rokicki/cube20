Another alternative for Windows is Herbert Kociemba's Cube Explorer 1.5, which
is easily found with Web based search engines, and which I think can also be
found on the download section of the Cube-Lovers site.

Cube Explorer 1.5 does not allow you to type in a maneuver directly, which I
think is what you are after. But it will do something just about as good, and
in some ways even better. It will read in a standard ASCII text file which
contains maneuvers in standard Singmaster notation (the BFUDLR notation), and
it will then show you the end product.  The file can contain any (reasonable)
number of maneuvers, and the program will show you the end product for each
maneuver all in one fell swoop (or swell foop, if you prefer).

One thing Cube Explorer 1.5 does not support that you may be looking for is to
manipulate the cube and look at each intermediate position.  But that's usually
not what I am looking for.  I am usually looking for the end product of a
maneuver.  (Of course, you could put each intermediate position into your ASCII
text file.)

You can create the ASCII text file for Cube Explorer 1.5 by typing maneuvers
into the file with the text editor of your choice.  But most typically I just
cut and paste maneuvers out of an E-mail into the text file, and then have Cube
Explorer 1.5 read the file.  It's much easier and less error prone than typing
the maneuvers myself.

Here is a case where Cube Explorer 1.5 may be "even better".  Take a
Cube-Lovers message with lots of maneuvers, cut and paste the whole thing into
an ASCII text file, and read the file into Cube Explorer 1.5.  Instantly, you
see the positions for all the maneuvers.  You don't even have to worry about
deleting the extraneous non-maneuver text from the E-mail.  For example, take
Mike Reid's lists of minimal maneuvers for highly symmetric positions, or take
my lists of local maxima and put them into Cube Explorer 1.5 in this fashion.
The results are quite pretty.  There are many other messages in the Cube-Lovers
archives with lots of pretty patterns, but these two come to mind quickly.

(By the way, converting BFUDLR strings to a graphical representation of a
position is an extremely useful feature of Cube Explorer 1.5, but it has
several other nice features. For example, you can give it a graphical
representation of a position and get back very quickly --  in a matter of
seconds -- a very good suboptimal maneuver for that position.)
