Subject: RE: Wrist pains

	Beryl Fletcher, who organized my first cube at the International
Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki in 1978, also developed Cubist's Thumb.
The early cubes were stiff and one held them with a corner pressing on the
tendon of the left thumbb, in the fleshy part of the thumb.  With olde people,
the tendon sheath, or rather the inner lubricant, has become a bit aged and the
constant pressure leads to a chronic inflammation.  This is readily treated by
a small operation which cuts open the tendon sheath.  Both Dame Kathleen
Ollerneshaw and Beryl Fletcher had this.
	When I was working on my Notes, I did a lot of checking of move
sequences and typing and got definite pains in the wrist.  Since then, word
processing has also occasionally produced RSI problems.  Fortunately, rest lets
it go away, but I have had physiotherapy several times.  There were several
periods when I had to stop typing for several weeks!  The most unusual
diagnosis was stiff neck due to tension while typing.  Physiotherapy helped
that.  All the warnings/instructions about RSI are worth heeding.  Take breaks.
Stretch regularly.  Make sure your work station is comfortable.  Etc.  RSI is
real and I've known several people semi-permanently disabled by it.
