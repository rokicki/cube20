This is what my Rubik's Calendar looks like (use a non-proportional
typeface).  The date is as I took it out of the box, from which I
deduce I last played with it in 1982, since I certainly haven't
touched it this decade. Curiously enough, it will be correct again
this year.

The digits in the lower right corners  of the cells indicate the
orientation in quarter turns from the vertical as shown in the
diagram.  But the orientations can be worked out anyway for all except
the centre pieces, because of the requirement to be the right way up
on the face showing the date.
