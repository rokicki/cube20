Subject: RE: Different versions of the Ideal cube

	Ideal certainly did use oriental suppliers when the Great Cube Craze
was on and I recall several qualities of cube appeared here.  I can't remember
for sure if they ever sold the open cornered versions.  I definitely don't
recall examples with markedly different colors.  When Rubik's Fourth Dimension
was launched here, I saw that they were using distinctly poor quality cubes,
presumably from China or thereabouts.  One person at the launch said hers broke
within an hour.
