	I am having problems with this step.  My cube is in a
	configuration that this maneuver does not solve:

                YYY
		YYG  <- Back face
		GGG

	    BBW ORO BBW ROR
	    BBB ROR WWW ORO  <- Bottom face
	    BWW ORO BWW ROR

		YYY
		YGG  <- Front face
		GGG


	FRFRFR does not solve the corners for this position.
