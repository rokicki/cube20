Hello Cube Lover's

	Thanks to all who have provided information that should help me to
track down some of the items on my wanted list. I have had several requests
for pictures of cubes I have and picts of disassembled cubes. Well good
news! I purchased a digital camera yesterday and will be taking picts of
all requested items this weekend (time permitting) and I will post them
online.

A good weekend to all.
