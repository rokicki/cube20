Has anyone been able to get through to Puzzletts at all? I've been trying
to get through to their site for the past month or so, but it's always
"down, overloaded, or unreachable" (surely they could narrow it down a
bit better than that!). Does anyone know what's going on? Has it crashed
and burned for good? L8r.
