Hi all,

Has anybody even built (or throught about building) a device 
which physically solves a cube? Something like a combination 
of a vision system to recognize the colors, a 'robot arm'
which can perform the rotations and a computer to solve the 
mathematics and to operate the robot arm.

I'm currently thinking about making such a system, so I'm 
interested if anybody else has done something similar.

Greetings,

[ Moderator's note: I'm sure there are some mentions of such efforts
  in the archives.  I seem to recall one such project at the
  University of Maryland. --Dan ]
