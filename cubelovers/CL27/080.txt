I would prefer that there is no preview time. Solving the cube isn't just 
turning the faces, it's also deciding which faces to turn. Surely, time spent 
in examining the cube is therefore part of the solving time.

I used to do a run of 11, then take the median (middle) value.

[Moderator's note: While would I avoid previews in principle, I
 understand that the official contests were carried out with a free
 preview period.  It seems unavoidable that we qualify all our records
 with the conditions under which they are measured--with or without
 preview; best score, average, or median; by sight or by touch; in air
 or underwater; solo or mixed doubles; etc. --Dan ]
