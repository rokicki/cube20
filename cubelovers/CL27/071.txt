 Although I'm not really sure of my info, I believe WD-40 was
originally a Water Displacer, hence "WD". Fairly sure it was meant
to displace water from mechanisms made of metal. It's possible that
its lubricating properties were secondary. As a semi-amateur
mechanical technician, I gather that it's not intended to be used as
a long-term lubricant. Used as intended, it seems to be a very good
product.

 As to compatibility with plastics, I once was cleaning the inside
of a computer printer that had a clear plastic rack which engaged a
gear on the print head drive motor (which, amazingly enough, was on
the print head itself; no kidding). I was using rubbing alcohol, as
I remember. Whether it was the alcohol itself, or an adiitive to
dilute it, I don't know, but the rack crystallized, cracked, and
fell apart in only a few minutes. Astonishing to watch.

 Alcohol is usually a safe solvent for electronic work, but
apparently not for some plastic mechanical parts! Of course, I had
knowingly ignored the warning not to use any solvents for cleaning.

 Lesson from this is that there's some risk in applying liquids of
unknown compatibility to some plastics. HDPE won't be bothered by
any liquid you're likely to apply. Silicones (not spelled "silicons")
should be safe, very likely, and Teflon powder would be. (Just don't
get that powder near a cigarette or flame; decomposition products
are very poisonous.)
