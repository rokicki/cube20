Subject: "The" Hungarian cube ??

I recently bought a rubik's cube from someone.  It was in a blue cardboard
box that has Hungarian all over it.  The closest thing to a logo says:
"Politoys" and under that it reads: Hungary Budapest.  On one side of the
box there is a long three paragraph description which I can't read and it's
signed by E. Rubik.

When I opened it up I found a cube that looks in every way identical to the
Ideal version of the rubik's cube.  Same colors.  Same "Rubik's cube" logo
in the center white square.

Does anyone know if this is, in fact, a very early version of the cube or
did someone put an Ideal cube in this box?  What was the first and original
cube?  The guy who sold it to me is also very curious.  Could it be that
Ideal took over and this is a later production that was begin sold in
Hungary?  I'm wondering then why there is no indication of "Ideal" anywhere
on it.
