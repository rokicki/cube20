Gene Johannsen sent in a reply agreeing that he had probably made a
twisto in scrambling the cube. The moderator did not forward that
reply to the group, hoping instead to determine a sure answer to the
question.  I'm sorry if the delay has cast doubt on Wei-Hwa Huang's
antislice algorithm (which I have not examined in detail).

The problem is actually fairly difficult if we want a definitive
answer for any antislice-group position--Singmaster (p. 54) despairs
of presenting Morwen B. Thistlethwaite's analysis of the antislice
group, settling instead for an outline.  I must admit that I have not
yet found a complete answer that can be carried out by hand.  However,
I have a method that will recognize positions in a group four times
the size of the antislice group, and that is good enough to weed out
almost all of the near misses.  In fact, a simpler method that will
detect positions in a group 972 times the size of the antislice group
is sufficient for the case in question.

As in Singmaster we consider a corner-based representation.  That is
to say, we keep the BLD corner from moving, and perform an antislice
as a half-turn of the F, T, or R face together with a quarter-turn of
the adjacent center-slice.  [ For newcomers, I'll mention that my use
of "T" for "Top" instead of "U" for "Up" is an intentional preference;
see 22 Feb 90 and 28 Oct 94 in the archives for an explanation. ]

In this representation the face centers form a movable part of the
cube.  We could represent their position as a permutation of the six
face centers, but it is more convenient to represent them as a
permutation of the four major diagonals of the enclosing cube, as Jim
Saxe and I did for the Tartan cube (16 February 1981).  We may label
the faces and diagonal-endpoints as follows:

     Z---X
     | B |
 Z---W---Y---X---Z
 | L | T | R | D |
 Y---X---Z---W---Y
     | F |
     Y---W

The T antislice acts on the face centers as (F,L,B,R) and on the
diagonals as (W,Y,Z,X).  Similarly, the R antislice induces the face
permutation (T,B,D,F) and the diagonal permutation (W,Z,Y,X). The F
antislice induces the permutations (L,T,R,D) and (W,Y,X,Z).  In the
following, I will use note the diagonal permutations.

In addition to the face centers, there are three orbits of edge cubies
and two orbits of corner cubies (ignoring BLD).  The corner
orientation never changes, and reorientation of edges is applied to an
entire orbit at a time.  I label the edges and corners as follows:

         [Z]--Z3--Xp
          |       |
          Z2  B   Y2
          |       |
 [Z]--Z2--Wp--Y3--Y---Y2--Xp--Z3-[Z]
  |       |       |       |       |
  Z1  L   X1  T   Y1  R   W1  D   Z1
  |       |       |       |       |
  Yp--X2--X---X3--Zp--W2--W---W3--Yp
          |       |
          X2  F   W2
          |       |
          Yp--W3--W

The diagonals W-Wp, X-Xp, Y-Yp, and Z-Zp are labeled Wc, Xc, Yc, and
Zc, respectively, for the purpose of recording the face center
position.  In addition I label the orientation of the edge orbits as
P1, P2, and P3, where P1^2 = P2^2 = P3^2 = I.  (These could be
represented as permutations of 2-sets, but that seems unnecessary).

So the three antislices are:

    Fa = (W,X)(Yp,Zp) (W1,Z1,X1,Y1) (W2,X2) (W3,X3) P1 (Wc,Yc,Xc,Zc),
    Ta = (X,Y)(Wp,Zp) (X1,Y1) (W2,X2,Z2,Y2) (X3,Y3) P2 (Wc,Yc,Zc,Xc),
    Ra = (W,Y)(Xp,Zp) (W1,Y1) (W2,Y2) (W3,X3,Y3,Z3) P3 (Wc,Zc,Yc,Xc).

         corner perm   edge perm                    ori  center perm

It is immediately apparent that each antislice is an odd permutation
of each orbit of corners, of each orbit of edges, and of the center
diagonals. In addition, the number of Pi orientations is changed by
one on each antislice.  Thus we expect to see each of these seven
parities agree in any position of the antislice group.

Gene Johannsen's position (after replacing color letters with position
letters) is

        BBB
        BBF  <- Back face
        FFF

    LLR TDT LLR DTD
    LLL DTD RRR TDT  <- Down face
    LRR TDT LRR DTD

        BBB
        BFF  <- Front face
        FFF

which is represented as

    (X,Y) (Wp,Zp) (W1,Y1)(X1,Z1) (X2,Y2) (W3,Y3,Z3,X3)

in the corner-based representation.  Here the permutations on the
corner orbits and two of the edge orbits is odd.  But the
{W1,X1,Y1,Z1} orbit has an even permutation and the orientation and
center positions are the identity, of even parity.  So the position
cannot be in the antislice group.

I noticed that the difference could conceivably be caused by a single
error, say an F-slice move:

  Fs = (W1,Z1,X1,Y1) (Wc,Yc,Xc,Zc) P1,

and with a short program in GAP I was able to find the following
single-error process for Gene's position:

    Fa Ta Fs Fa Ta' Fa Ra^2.

Now I'll apologize to anyone whose head is reeling, and invite anyone
who's game to join in a little bit of slightly tougher group theory.
This will show you how far I've been able to analyze the antislice
group, and the part that remains mysterious.

Note that the parity constraints above allow:

    6 permutations of {W,X,Y},
    24 permutations of {Wp,Xp,Yp,Zp},
    24 permutations each of {W1,X1,Y1,Z1}, {W2,X2,Y2,Z2}, and {W2,X2,Y2,Z2},
    8 subsets of {P1,P2,P3}, and
    24 permutations of {Wc,Xc,Yc,Zc},

with a parity constraint on the seven components that reduces the
number by 2^6, for

    6 * 8 * 24^5 / 64 = 5971968

possible positions.  Singmaster notes that the actual size of the
antislice group is 6144 = 5971968 / 972 positions.  Clearly there are
more constraints at work than permutation parity.  Most of them are
due to life in a certain quotient group.  The group S4 of permutations
on four letters contains a normal subgroup consisting of the identity
plus the three pairs of two-cycles:

    H = { (), (W,X)(Y,Z), (W,Y)(X,Z), (W,Z)(X,Y) }.

The quotient S4/H then has six elements, and is isomorphic to S3.  We
can see this explicitly by writing down the blocks of S4/H:

   Block 0      Block 1    Block 2    Block 3    Block 4    Block 5

   ()           (W,X,Y)    (W,Y,X)    (W,X)      (W,Y)      (X,Y)
   (W,X)(Y,Z)   (W,Y,Z)    (W,Z,Y)    (Y,Z)      (X,Z)      (W,Z)
   (W,Y)(X,Z)   (W,Z,X)    (W,X,Z)    (W,Y,X,Z)  (W,X,Y,Z)  (W,X,Z,Y)
   (W,Z)(X,Y)   (X,Z,Y)    (X,Y,Z)    (W,Z,X,Y)  (W,X,Y,X)  (W,Y,Z,X)

The top line of each block shows the element of S3=S({W,X,Y})
corresponding to the block.  Note how easy it is to recognize the
blocks 3, 4, and 5:

    If you have a four-cycles, use one two-cycle from its square;
    If you have a two-cycle containing Z, use the disjoint two-cycle.

This procedure will yield the S3 representative from these blocks.

Now remember the antislices?

    Fa = (W,X)(Yp,Zp) (W1,Z1,X1,Y1) (W2,X2) (W3,X3) P1 (Wc,Yc,Xc,Zc),
    Ta = (X,Y)(Wp,Zp) (X1,Y1) (W2,X2,Z2,Y2) (X3,Y3) P2 (Wc,Yc,Zc,Xc),
    Ra = (W,Y)(Xp,Zp) (W1,Y1) (W2,Y2) (W3,X3,Y3,Z3) P3 (Wc,Zc,Yc,Xc).

Ignoring the orientation component, we see that the action of every
component of Fa is from block 3, every component of Ta from block 4,
and every component of Ra from block 5.  So for every position in
< Fa, Ta, Ra >, each permutation orbit will be in the same block, and
the orientation component must still agree in parity.  So instead
dividing by 2^6, we divide by 6^5 2 = 15552, for

    6 * 8 * 24^5 / 15552 = 24576

positions, which is only four times the size of the actual antislice
group.

The factor of four arises if we fix all but the {Wp,Xp,Yp,Zp} and
{Wc,Xc,Yc,Zc} orbits.  There are only four possibilities for the last
two orbits, rather than the sixteen that my analysis provides.  (As
Singmaster notes, when the other components are the identity, the four
possibilities consist of SOLVED and the four Zigzag/Laughter
patterns).  Unfortunately, I have not found any way to describe the
correspondence between these components in general, to make the
analysis exact.
