It is one of a series of three that are on sale in the UK in the
cheaper toy shops.  They were mentioned on Cube-lovers in March.

The big one that you have works pretty well and makes a handsome
display object.  There is also a normal-sized cube also with tiles
that is about the most horrible to turn I have ever met - the
shop-keeper even felt compelled to warn of the fact me in advance.
Then there is also a key-ring sized cube (30 cm) which turns tolerably
well and has conventional stickers, though not firmly stuck on, for
only 73 pence in my local shop.  Apparently the children like them
because they are so easy to solve by rearranging the stickers.
