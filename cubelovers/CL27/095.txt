Subject: Huge Cube!

My cousin came back from england on his recent trip and brought me home
a cube. Most cubes are 57mm. This one is.. wait for it.. 90mm. Has
anyone else got one of these? I'd never heard or read about one before.

It's a tile cube that is of average quality. It was bought at a market
near a place called Kensington.
