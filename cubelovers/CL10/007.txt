Subject: Contents of CFF31

Last Friday I received issue #31 of Cubism For Fun.  A short summary of
the contents:

1.  Short articles by Jan de Geus and Frans de Vreugd about Cube Day 1992.
2.  An article by Herbert Kociemba about a classification of pretty
    patterns on the cube.
3.  Reflections by Tom Verhoeff about puzzles and computers.
4.  Announcement by Koos Verhoef and Tom Verhoeff of a contest *.
5.  A short article by Jaques Haubrich about Rubik's Tangle and how to
    position 24 parts in a cube like way (four on a side).
6.  An article by Jan Verbakel about the creation of castles with solid
    pentominoes.
7.  A short article by Trevor Wood on the pecking of octacubes.
8.  A short article by Jaques Haubrich about a difficult packing problem.
9.  An article by David Singmaster about a gathering in Atlanta in honor
    of Martin Gardner.  (Nearly the whole puzzling world appears to have
    been there.)
10. A new contest by Anton Hanegraaf.
11. Announcement of the 13th Dutch cube day on August 22 in Amsterdam.
    This day is next to the 13th International Puzzle Party.

*   This is an interesting puzzle indeed.  Consider the densest sphere
    packing in 3D.  This is the packing where you start with a lattice
    of spheres based on a triangular lattice, and put on top of it another,
    similar, lattice such that each sphere of the new layer fits in a hole
    in the lower layer.  Add more layers.  Pick from that all possible
    configurations of 4 connected spheres.  There are 25 such
    configurations.  The puzzle is to create from these 25 pieces a
    pyramid with a side of 8 spheres (which contains 120 spheres), with
    a hole at the center that consists of a pyramid with a side of 4
    spheres (remember those sums of triangular numbers!).  It is not
    known whether there is a solution.  The authors tell how they have
    a TRS-80 now running 5 years on this problem, using backtracking
    techniques.  Until now the first 6 pieces did not move.  The could
    fit 24 pieces already 521,010 times.  The puzzle was first announced
    at the previous Cube Day.

CFF is a newsletter published by the Nederlandse Kubus Club NKC (Dutch
Cubists Club).  It appears a bit irregular, but a few times a year.
Yearly membership fee is now NLG 25.- (Dutch Guilders) which amounts to
approximately $ 15.-.  Information:
