Games People Play in Harvard Square had a number of 3X3X3 that go by the
name "Fourth Dimension" or something like that (they various have logos and
a picture that looks like a profile of Rubik on four of the center faces).

It was something on the order of $10.

It also seemed more cheaply made than my other, older cubes.  It felt,
well, "lighter" in my hand and is rather more difficult to turn than I'm
used to.  It's not that they're unusable, and it's just not that they're
just stiff, rather that they seem to be slightly out of alignment.  Perhaps
if you are someone who knows how to fine tune these things...
