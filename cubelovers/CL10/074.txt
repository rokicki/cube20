Subject:   Unique Antipodal of the 3x3x3 Edges

In answer to the question by Dan Hoey, I printed out the unique
antipodal of the 3x3x3 edges  --  the one configuration that is
15 moves from Start using only q-turns on the edges of the 3x3x3.

It is really quite extraordinary and wonderful.  I already knew
that there were only four equivalence classes with 24 elements.
Well, two of them are Start itself and its antipodal.  Without
further ado:


          *6*              *6*
          6*6              3*4
          *6*              *1*
          *2*              *5*
          2*2              3*4
          *2*              *2*
       *3**1**4*        *1**1**1*
       3*31*14*4        5*23*42*5
       *3**1**4*        *6**6**6*
          *5*              *2*
          5*5              3*4
          *5*              *5*

         Start          Antipodal

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
