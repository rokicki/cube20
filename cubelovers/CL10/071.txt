Subject: Re: God's Algorithm, 24-fold Symmetry, Edges of 3x3x3

These results look very interesting, though I haven't had time to
examine them closely, nor even (in a few cases) quite understand them.
I especially like to see the categorization by symmetry class.

I was somewhat startled to see the unique antipode of the 3x3x3 edges
in the quarter-turn metric.  Do you know what pattern that is?
