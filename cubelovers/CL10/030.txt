Sorry.  I can't let this one pass by without comment.

Unless Snyder or his agent is talking about a God's Algorithm for
Square-1, this statement is ridiculous.
I doubt that this number includes myself, as I have only told a few family
members and friends that I have solved this.  (I expect many of you can say
the same thing.)

Harder than Rubik's?  This is a matter of opinion and definition.
Do they mean conceptually harder, harder to derive a solution method,
harder to prove a solution method, or harder to achieve an individual
solution attempt?  Or does harder just mean more time?  More time
to derive a solution method, more time to prove a solution method,
or more time to achieve an individual solution attempt?
I don't really doubt the last.  Except for the Pyraminx (and the 2-Cube),
all of the puzzles of this type take me longer to solve than the Cube.
I think that the Rubik's cube still holds the record as the puzzle that
took me longest to derive a solution method.  (Of course all of the others
borrowed substantially from the cube.)

Sorry, I don't have any.  Except the 10x10 Rubik's Tangle.
