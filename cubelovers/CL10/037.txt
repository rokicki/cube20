Well, I finally know what all the square's group antipodes look like.
Next message I'll post a detailed summary on these patterns.

I wrote a colour printer driver for my cube program today, tested
it and it turned out pretty slick. I'm using a Star NX2420 rainbow
printer and I'm (out of necessity) using

   FACE         Star NX2420    Code    Real Cube
   ----         -----------    ----    ---------

  TOP/DOWN     BLACK/CYAN     0/2     WHITE/BLUE
  LEFT/RIGHT   VIOLET/ORANGE  3/5     RED/ORANGE
  FRONT/BACK   YELLOW/GREEN   4/6     YELLOW/GREEN

...which works pretty good except violet is more like blue. I could
have also used magenta (sort of a pink) for red but it does not
(contrast well with orange.

Should make the DOTC (Domain of the Cube) Newsletter look a lot
better if I can ever finish the damn thing!

More notes to follow....
