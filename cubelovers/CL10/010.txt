Subject: Rubik's Shrimp

I hear on Usenet that there's a show on BBC1 called Wildlife 100,
where people saw a Mantis Shrimp playing with a Rubik's Cube.  Reports
are inconclusive as to whether it was able to actually turn faces, or
whether it just waved it around, or even just took it apart.  Now if
they could get it to turn faces, presumably they could film it and
play it back in reverse....
