Subject: Diameter of cube group?

   Disclaimer: this sounds more authoritative than is intended--I really
   don't know what I'm talking about.
Don't worry.  Mathematical reasoning stands on its own merits.
   It couldn't be very pointy.  From the most distant configuration,
   there are 6 positions immediately before it.  There are 6^2 two steps
   away, 6^3 three steps, etc.  (well, 6^2 - 1 and 6^3 - ?) actually.
Very good.  This is a necessary insight, regardless of the exact
numerical details.  (For example, you mean 12, not 6.)  But the
possible flaw is that there might be more than one maximally distant
state; if their sets of neighbors overlap viciously enough, this
effect could make the tail pointier.  You can make valence-12 graphs
(not of groups, just arbitrary graphs) that have fairly bumpy
distance-vs-population functions.  Any argument that rigorously
constrains N(d) must somehow appeal to the fact that the cube graph is
a Cayley graph, that is, the graph of a group.

[...]

   This gives me the feeling that Monte Carlo is fairly valid.  (How's
   that for rigor?)

It's a start.  But we have to use groupness somehow.
