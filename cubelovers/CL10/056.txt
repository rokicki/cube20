During the Christmas toy season last year, a local supermarket/department
store chain (Meijer in Michigan) had 3x3x3 cubes.  I don't recall the
manufaturer, but they used the "Rubik's Cube" brand name.  They also
had a picture on the center cubies on each face that had to be
correctly rotated for a "proper" solution.  I can't recall the price,
but it was reasonable.  Maybe they will be easier to find as Christmas
gets closer.

Good luck,

Carl Raymond
