Fascinating news from Dik Winter about the solving of 9000 configurations.

Can someone please remind us exactly what Kociemba's algorithm is; or at
least a breif outline of how it works.   I know I've heard the name before,
but can't remember anything about it.

Thanks,  Bill Taylor.         wft@math.canterbury.ac.nz
