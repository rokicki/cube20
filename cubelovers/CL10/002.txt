NO cubing isn't dead.
CFF will hold its annual meeting the
day after IPP, which is in amsterdam this year.

their newsletter is still published.

There is a renewed interest as indicated by
sales of magic solids.  In particular
ISHI PRESS, san jose is comerrcially
selling:
  5xs
  super novas - hungarian made regular dodecahedrons

I believe that there are 2 books on square 1 in
the editing stage.  I don't know when/if they will
go to print.

there was discussion and a solution to square 1 
posted to this list, in addition the test issue
of a puzzling magazine from ISHI press featured
square 1.

check the literature.

THE FUTURE IS PUZZLING,
