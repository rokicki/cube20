As they commute I did it the other way around.  But I am highly
suspicious that you tried it yourself.  10 minutes and only down
to 22 turns.  But continuing, possibly for weeks/months.

On another machine I am trying to prove that 20 is minimal for
superfliptwist.  90 hours gone, still nothing.  Most of the time
is not spend with phase 1 set to 16 turns.  Phase 1 to 13 got it
doen to 20.  Nothing new with phase 1 to 14 or 15.  16 turns in
phase 1 allows at most 3 turns in phase 2.  The latter can be time
consuming.  I do not know in how many cases actually something is
done in phase 2.  When I get to 17 turns in phase 1, I suspect in
most cases in phase 2 it is immediately clear that it can not be
solved.  But I am patient.
