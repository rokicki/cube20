I only have one quarter of that puzzle...(section 4).

I worked on it for a considerable amount of time, and concluded that the only
solution method was trial and error.

So I wrote a program to do it for me.
I know all 16 solutions (2 unique)*(2 identical exchanged pieces)*(4
orientations).

Has anyone come up with a method, besides trial and error, that solves
this thing?  (or the 10x10?)
(hmmm--I wonder how much the other 3 would cost?)
