Subject:   God's Algorithm, 24-fold Symmetry, Edges of 3x3x3

I just finished tabulating the results with 24-fold symmetry for
the edges of the 3x3x3 cube.  I have added them to the table
I posted earlier today which had 1152-fold symmetry.

A couple of reminders.  In the case of 1152-fold symmetry, most but not
all of the equivalence classes have exactly 1152 elements.  In the case
of 24-fold symmetry, every equivalence class has exactly 24 elements.
Thus, you can almost, but not quite, get from the 1152-fold column
to the 24-fold column by multiplying by 48.  Also, my program actually
generated the 1152-fold column.  However, it did not generate the
24-fold column.  That would have taken far too long.  Rather, I generated
the 24-fold column from the 1152-fold column by determining the sizes
of all the equivalence classes.  Finally, note that the total figure
for the 24-fold symmetry column can be calculated as
40,874,803,200 = [12!(2^12)/2] / 24, so the total is correct.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
