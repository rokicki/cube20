Subject:   God's Algorithm for the Corners of the 3x3x3

Here are my God's Algorithm results for the corners of the
3x3x3 cube.  I explained in the last post what I mean by
1152-fold symmetry and 24-fold symmetry.  The 1152-fold
symmetry is what I actually calculated.  In this particular
case, I did not do the 24-fold symmetry calculations myself
based on the size of the equivalence classes as I did
with the 2x2x2 cube.  Rather, I went back and found the
figures in the Cube-Lover archives (Dik Winter's post).

It turns out that the maximum distance from Start is the same
for the corners of the 3x3x3 cube as it is for the 2x2x2 cube.
I found this rather surprising, although the archives of
Cube-Lovers do provide a reasonable explanation.  I am just
going to have to go back and read it five or ten times until
I fully understand it.  In any case, I was curious about the
following question.  Suppose you are N moves from Start on the
corners of the 3x3x3.  How many moves from Start would you be
on the 2x2x2 if the 2x2x2 was in the same configuration as the
corners of the 3x3x3 where you currently were.  As it turns out,
I stored the results for the 2x2x2 in the same data base as
I stored the results for the corners of the 3x3x3, so the
question was easy to answer.  Here are the results.
