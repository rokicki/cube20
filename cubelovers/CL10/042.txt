All this misses the point (so to speak) which is that 12^N is _exceedingly_
pointy for our purposes. If one samples only 1000 positions out of ~10E19,
then one could very well miss a 12^N tail of length 14 moves!

The estimate of 22 as an upper limit relies on the intuition that
the distribution is MUCH blunter than this.
