Subject:  Re:  Hint wanted for 4x4x4

Hi Ronnie

Let me try to restate the problem slightly to make sure we are talking
about the same problem.

Basically, you can solve the entire cube, except that the pieces "1" and
"2" in the diagram are flipped/exchanged:

  XXXX
  XXXX
  XXXX
  X12X

Assuming this is the problem, the hint is as follows: 

The problem here is that some of the face pieces are not really in their
right places.  In short, one of the center slices is 1/4 turn out of phase.

The simplest way to proceed (at least for me) is to move to the following
state: 

  XX2X    (i.e. rotate one of the central slices 1/4 turn)
  XXOX
  XXOX
  X1OX
    ^
    |
Now, you can solve for pieces "1" and "2" and --using these pieces as a
landmark-- proceed from there.

Hint #2: You can help avoid this problem by solving the face pieces last.


Extra Credit: Actually, the state as shown in the first diagram above is
pretty interesting in that the analogous position on a 3X3X3 cube (i.e. a
single flipped edge cube) is of course impossible.
