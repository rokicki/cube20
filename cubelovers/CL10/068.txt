Subject:   Addendum to God's Algorithm for the 2x2x2 Cube

I had intended to include the following table in my first
post concerning God's Algorithm for the 2x2x2 cube, but
I forgot.  It addresses the question of how large are the
equivalence classes in the search tree, where the equivalence
classes are generated by the two rotational symmetry groups
and the one reflectional symmetry group.  Most of the
equivalence classes have 24*24*2=1152 elements, but some have
fewer.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
