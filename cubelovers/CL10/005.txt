Subject: 3x3x3 puzzles and other lists?

Hi,

I have recently found this mailing list and have just finished reading
through the earlier postings.

Perhaps this don't really belong to this list, but I have a list of
different puzzles that in their final state is a 3x3x3 cube. Among them are,
of course, Rubik's cube. The Soma cube and related puzzles are also there.

If you'd like a copy of the list, please MAIL me.

I also wonder if you know about other mailing lists or such which deals with
puzzles (preferrable mechanical). (I know about USENET/NEWS group rec.puzzles.)

Thanks

Johan
