Disclaimer: this sounds more authoritative than is intended--I really
don't know what I'm talking about.


It couldn't be very pointy.  From the most distant configuration,
there are 6 positions immediately before it.  There are 6^2 two steps
away, 6^3 three steps, etc.  (well, 6^2 - 1 and 6^3 - ?) actually.

This is necessarily so, as if any of the configurations reachable with
two twists (for example) are closer in than (max - 2) steps then you
could reach the maximum configuration by getting there and then doing
the two steps.

This gives me the feeling that Monte Carlo is fairly valid.  (How's
that for rigor?)
