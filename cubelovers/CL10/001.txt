I'll say... when I saw this post it reminded me that I've been watching
this group for about two months hoping to see some mention of Square-1,
but have been left disapointed.. (wimper wimper whine.) :)
So let me ask... Does anyone have a solution to Square-1?  Is there
a simple ``operator'' based method, like there is for the cube?
If it is simple enough to explain in text, could someone please
post it?  Has there been a ``solutions book'' published?

obviously in the dark on recent cubic developments,
joe
