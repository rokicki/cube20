Subject: Kociemba's algorithm

I have received a few requests for information about the algorithm and
for the program.  I have put the program available for ftp.  In the
set of files there is also a Description I edited from a number of
messages I mailed a long time ago to this mailing list.  They give
a reasonable description of the algorithm.

Ftp to ftp.cwi.nl.  File is: /pub/dik/cube.tar.Z.  Do not forget
to set binary mode.
