I was extremely surprised as well.  With all my previous work, there
was no unique antipode.  I don't know what it is yet, but I can find
out without a whole lot of trouble.  It is somewhere on the 31-st
tape, so I just need to spin that tape, looking for a record at level
15, and  print it out.  I will try to get to that sometime in the
next few days.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
