Subject: Re: Hint wanted for 4x4x4

Ronnie B. Kon asked for a hint but not a solution.  So here is a hint.

If I understood correctly your descriptions of two transforms which you
asserted to be equivalent, then in fact they are not equivalent.
(Of course, if I didn't understand your descriptions correctly, then
this isn't a hint.)
