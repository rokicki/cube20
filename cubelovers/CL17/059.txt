My permutation group memory is rusty.  Is it the "degree" of G you're
asking for?

I also get n = 32 as the smallest |S_n| divisible by |G|.  I suspect
one can argue |G| must divide |A_n| (still requiring only n >= 32),
and if we can argue |G|*12 must divide |S_n| (accounting for all
parities of edges and corners) we get n >= 33.

On the flip side, I'll assert G has degree <= 42 (which is less than
the obvious representation in S_48).  If anyone can prove me either
right or wrong, please do so.  My assertion is based on the following
hand-waving argument:

G is a wreath product (or some kind of product) of the following
subgroups:
A:  S_8   8! corner positions
B:  3^7   3^7 corner orientations
C:  A_12  12!/2 edge positions
D:  2^11  2^11 edge orientation

Clearly subgroup A has degree 8 and C has degree 12.  

I claim (wave hands wildly:-) that BxD has degree at most 22, since it
can be embedded in an S_22.  I use every even factor of 22! for a component
of 2^11, and every third factor of 22! for a component of 3^7.  

Divisibility arguments suggest some smaller S_n might embed 2^11x3^7,
but I don't know whether such embeddings can be realized.  This is an
obvious area to consider for lowering the upper bound on degree(G).  By
divisibility we can conceivably embed 2^11x3^7 in an S_18, but not in
an S_17.

Finally, the degree of a wreath(?) product is bounded by the sum of
the degrees of the multiplicands, hence 
degree(G) <= 8 + 12 + 22 = 42.

If this (alleged) degree 42 construction is valid, is 42 minimal?  I
strongly doubt it.
