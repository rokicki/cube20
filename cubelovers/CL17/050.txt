Um...If I were a better net.person, I'd look up which version of the cube 
has that number of elements, but wouldn't it be correct to say that each 
move of the cube is a permutation of the pieces of the cube, i.e. the 26 
cubies?  (Or even, depending on which cube-model you are using(This is 
what I should have looked up), if you ignore center cubie orientation, 
the 20 cubies?)

If that logic holds, then the largest possible S_n would be S_20, much 
less than the 32 that you claim is minimal...

...I think I'm just confused--can you alleviate that problem?
