I am not quite sure why it took me so long to figure out that
Q2-conjugation was the appropriate symmetry when generating G
without B and B'.  With the wisdom if hindsight, it is perhaps
because the Q2 subgroup of M could be described as fixing the
B and F face centers, and I was thinking only in terms of fixing
the B face center.  Obviously, you cannot fix the B face center
without also fixing the F face center.  Thus, it is clear that
Q2-conjugation is also the appropriate symmetry when generating
G without F and F'.

Q1 and Q3 are subgroups of M which are conjugate with Q2 in Dan's
taxonomy of subgroups of M.  Q1 fixes the T and D face centers, and
would be the appropriate symmetry when generating G without T and T',
or without D and D'.  Q3 fixes the R and L face centers, and would be
the appropriate symmetry when generating G without R and R', or without
L and L'.
