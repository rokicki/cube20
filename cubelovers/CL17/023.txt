This problem was solved by David Benson in Oct. 1979, who was one of
the earliest cube pioneers. Dr. Singmaster reports on this in his
2nd Addendum of "Notes".

Let A = R1 L3 F2 B2 R1 L3, then AUA = D1

AUA = R1 L3 F2 B2 R1 L3 U1 R1 L3 F2 B2 R1 L3   (17 q, 13 q+h)

Perhaps Jerry will find something shorter.
