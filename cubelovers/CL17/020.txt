   Hi fellow 'netters,

   My name is Samantha Jerrings and I recently started using a magazine
   subscription club in the USA that has a FREE 1 yr. magazine subscription
   deal with your first paid order- and I have been very pleased with them.
   ...

it's because you're on Cube-Lovers.  Needless to say, I'll be protesting
this misuse of our mailing list.  Please do not respond to -me- about this
message.  And I would certainly encourage you not to order any magazines
from these slime-balls either!
