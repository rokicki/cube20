Well, I did get up to 12 q turns deep ;-)
Good enough for 2 half deep searches...

 But there is another possible verification method by counting the
number of even positions and odd positions and totalling them.

This is almost Cube Philosophy... how can we be certain about the true
nature of God's Algorithm? How can we be certain our cube databases
are completely accurate? I suppose it is not really a big problem
as long as the various cube programs all agree, and a human
observer executes such processes on a real cube.
