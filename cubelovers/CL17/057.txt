My suspicion is that "bad" or "good" parity is determined by what your
formulae are composed of.  An even number of center-plane moves will
preserve parity, and the opposite is true for odd center-plane moves.

If there really is a reason you're getting bad parity moves, that could
determine it.

However, I ran into a straight of 5 "good parity" situations recently,
and didn't really notice it until later, so perhaps it's a psychological
phenomenon as well (we gloss over good happenings, and dwell on tragedies.)
