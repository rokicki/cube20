Actually, I think the 4 "trillion" estimate is ignoring the center orientation.
Let's see:
  8! corner positions
x 3^7 corner orientations
x 12!/2 edge positions
x 2^11 edge orientations
= 4.325x10^19
Well, forty-three quadrillion.

Five center orientations force the sixth, so multiply your number by 4^5 to 
get the answer 4.429x10^22 positions, counting center piece 
orientations.  That's 44 quintillion.  Whew.

I remember when I solved the 5x5x5 cube (finally), someone asked me if I
had solved the "invisible" 3x3x3 inside it.  I'm not sure I even want to
think of trying to solve that.  I'll work on the 3x3x3x3 first.  :P
