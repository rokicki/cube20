Subject: Motif puzzles

Hi
  I converted my puzzles at ftp.x.org in /contrib/games/puzzles to
use Motif.  By default, the puzzles will compile and link with just the
X-Windows includes and libs.
 
  If there is demand, I could supply the Motif versions statically linked
for SunOS4.1.3.  The Motif versions have no increased functionality but may
be easier to use.
 
Cheers,
