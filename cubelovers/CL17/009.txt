Sorry to follow up on my own post, but I messed up a bit :)

>  12      4      U.R.F.D'

There is also U2R2F' which has less face turns but more quarter turns.

>  70      6      U.R'U.R.F.R'

This transform has in fact order 140!
The correct ones are:

 70   6   U.R.U'R.F.B'
 70   7   U2R'U2F'L'

> 110      8      U.R.U2R'F.R.L'

This should be U'R'U.R.F.D'B'L' (8 qt)

I converted my order-searching program to C and am now running
it on a Sun - expecting results on order 11 soon.
