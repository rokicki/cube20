Alas, there is little I can currently do about this, beyond complaining to
various postmaster addresses (which I have done).  As the Internet becomes
more of a capitalist free-for-all, even a moderately small mailing list
like Cube-Lovers (less than 200 members) becomes a target for things like
this.  The only real solution, given that it is no longer possible to rely
on people's courtesy, is to go for some kind of moderation.  And in fact, I
am developing some software to moderate Cube-Lovers (and another mailing
list I maintain).  When I'm done, the only changes you all should notice
are: (1) no more junk mail and (2) a slightly longer turnaround time when
you submit a legitimate message.  Until I've got that working all you can
do is ignore these losers.
