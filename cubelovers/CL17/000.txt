#   Here are a few Dino cube calculations. The calculations for the
# cube with an X cut on each of the 6 sides, assuming period 3
# rotations of 3 edges (there are 8 of these, one for each corner)

# The Dino cube has 12! /2 = 239,500,800 essential states
# Fixing one edge gives the Dino cube a fixed orientation
#  in space and gives 11! /2 = 19,958,400 combinations

# It has less combinations then the standard pyraminx, but more
#  than the 2x2x2 Rubik's Pocket cube.

# The Dino cube has 12 edges which can not flip, observed by Rubik
#  himself back in 1982 (re: Rubik's Logic & Fantasy in Space.)
# Dino cube has trivial centre
