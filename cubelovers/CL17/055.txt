It took me about 6 years. That problem was a little background process in my
brains. Then i went to the army. In the evenings i used to 'play' with 4x4x4
until one day. I noticed the same thing as you. 2 flipped edges can be
solved by turning one inner slice 90 degrees. Since then i haven't
discovered anythig new about this parity problem. That's why i asked if
anyone could do it less than 39 turns.

I have thought the center piece movements too. It must be very hard to see a
parity from certers, even if they were marked (position and orientation).
There are so many different 'right' positions too.

This reminds me another old question: 3x3x3 are told to have about 4
trillion (or whatever) different positions. How many of these positions are
'solved cube' but with different centerpiece combinations? Once i had 3x3x3
with 6 different pictures (picture/side). Friends asked me to solve it. When
i was completed, they laughed at me and pointed the bottom center piece,
which was out of orientation (i can't remember how many of centers were out
of order).

>Finally, here is my question.  On the 4x4x4, I get "bad parity" darn
>near every time.  Why isn't it 50-50 like the situation I have with

I don't know, but i guess: 1/4 you get it right and 3/4 goes wrong. I think
we must count that there are 2 inner slice states: right and wrong. There
are also 2 outer slice states: right and wrong (2 corners at wrong
position). It makes me think that 1/4.
