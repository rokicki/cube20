I certainly agree that confirming minimality is an important result.
Thanks, Jerry.

If I understand this, there are 16 positions at 9q from Start and 8q
from B, and there are 16 other positions at 8q from Start 9q from B.
Is each of the first bunch adjacent to exactly one of the other?  And
vice versa?  It would be good to get them reduced by Q2-conjugacy, as
well.

The reflections are similarly rrv, rrbv, ttv, and ttbv, where t and r
are the whole-cube rotations by the Top and Right faces, and v is the
central inversion.
