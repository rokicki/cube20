I agree that U's are more "consistent and standard", but for reasons
that have been discussed several times, T's would probably be better.
However, the effort to switch from U's to T's has not been very
successful.  Personally, I have *tried* to switch to T's, and it just
doesn't feel right.  So I have to share the blame for sabotaging the
switch to T's.
