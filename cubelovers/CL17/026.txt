Briefly, I am a old time cube fan and I am blind.  I have been blind for
about 9 years now due to complications from diabetes.  I recently
encountered a "Braille Or Tactile Rubik's cube" available from Japan.  I
finally received my cube from there after much expense and effort but it
was worth it.

Describing the cube:  it has designs on each side that can easily be
differentiated from the other.  ie; circles, plus, dotted circle,
smooth, six dotsand textured side.  I am now able to solve all but the
last bottom slice from memory but I would like to ask if anyone has a
xolution that I can read that would make sense to me?  I wish to solve
this and then move on to the other puzzles I have read on this list
mentioned.  I will have to mark them tactilly also.
            
Thanks for the time,

Tom Baccanti
