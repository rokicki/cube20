Hi
Recently I asked the question:
>   I have a question, I hope this makes sence. ;)   On a "nxnxn"
> tetrahedron with period 2 or period 3 turning or a "nxnxn" octahedron with

Well, if you believe proof by example on a simulated puzzle, then
Tetrahedron period 2 turning: never happens
Tetrahedron period 3 turning: starts when n=4 with center triangle
Octahedron period 3 turning: starts when n=4 with center triangle
Octahedron period 4 turning: starts with n=4 with center triangle
 
New versions of my pyraminx and octahedron puzzles will be out soon
to reflect this.
 
Cheers,
