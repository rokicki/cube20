Subject:   Preliminary Search Results for <F,U,L,R,D>

The first step in finding |B| in <F,U,L,R,D> is to build a little
Start-rooted data base using only the ten generators F, F', U, U', etc.
I was able to search eight levels deep with a "quick and dirty" search.
To search deeper would take a good bit longer.  I hope that eight levels
will be enough to calculate |B|.  By constructing a companion
B-rooted data base, I should be able to test up to 15 levels deep.
(B is odd, so eight levels deep for each half-depth search only
gets you 15 levels total instead of 16.)

I haven't started the search for B yet, but I thought the
results so far might be of minor interest in their own right.  As
I indicated before, these are actual cube positions.  I haven't
figured out any way to apply conjugacy classes to this problem.

I find it a little puzzling that the branching factor is not
monotonically decreasing (c.f., level 3 to level 4).
