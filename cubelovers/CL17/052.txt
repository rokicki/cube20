But my incorrect results for the 3x3x3 Corners plus face centers
passed this test, and were still incorrect.  Indeed, the incorrect
search found all the positions, the parity of all the lengths
was correct, the maximum length was correct, and the number of
positions at the maximum length was correct.  Yet, some of the
lengths were incorrect.
