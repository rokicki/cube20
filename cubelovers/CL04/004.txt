I just got mine (two) today.  I had a friend who was in Boston on a
business trip get them (to Phoenix) for me.  They are also available at
The Name of the Game in Faneuil Hall-Market Square also for $15 (14.99).

I spent a few hours playing this evening, wondering what tools others
have come up with.  I seem to be able to get three faces which share a
vertex into perfect shape, and then kind of falter.  Oh well, it will
have to wait until after work tomorrow (Friday).
