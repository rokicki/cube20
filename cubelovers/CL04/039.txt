Subject:  Rubic's Domino
I found one (for $11.00) at Games People Play in Cambridge.  Made in
Hungary, not by Ideal.

Haven't solved it yet.  The notes say you should be able to solve it
in 15 minutes.  It is a 3x3x2 construction; one face white; one black.
Each cube is numbered as on a domino.  The object is to get the numbers
and colors arrainged.
