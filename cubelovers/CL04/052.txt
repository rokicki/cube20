    I am really interested in when the _ Gardner is going to get
    his act together and publish THE cubing article-- each month
    for the last n I have eagerly taken the cover of SciAm and
    been disappointed. This is clearly THE mathematical game
    (since the inception of SciAm, with the possible exception of
    Conway's LIFE), and I wonder what he's waiting for.  About a
    week ago, I actually dreamt that I opened the SciAm wrapper
    and found the Cube on the cover, introducing a WHOLE ISSUE
    about it (Social implications, Ancient Cubing, Cubing in the
    Soviet Union, etc...)

Well, there finally was a Metamagical Themas column on the cube in
March '81.  Unfortunately, that article was mostly old hat to the
readers of Cube-Lovers.  The July '82 issue, just out, is a
different story.  Hofstadter discusses about twenty different
``Cube'' puzzles, based on all the regular polyhedra (and the
tesseract), several arrangements of twist axes and several coloring
schemes.  It even mentions cubing in the Soviet Union!  Stan Isaacs
<ISAACS at SRI-KL> is the Cube-Lovers representative for the new
article.

At last I can believe that Hofstadter's column will replace
Gardner's.
