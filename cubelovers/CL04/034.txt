There was a report on the Moleculon suit on WCVB, including a closeup
of the patent's picture page. The picture is of a 2x2 cube with the
cubies held together by magnets (the patent shows how the magnets are
to be arranged so the object will hold together).  The inventor of the
"Nicholls Cube" was shown working it.  It doesn't turn; you pull it
apart, turn it, and then stick it back together.  He never quite
claimed to have made a 3x3 version, and carefully tried to fudge the
distinction between his 2x2 frob and Rubik's 3x3.

My impression was that the guy is a sleazo trying to get an out-of-court
settlement from Ideal for $100k or so.
