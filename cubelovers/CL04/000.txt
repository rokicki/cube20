Those of you who look through the archives of old Cube-Lovers mail will notice
that I have split off a new section of the archive.  The mail now lives in:

MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL0	;oldest mail in foward order
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL1	;next oldest mail in foward order
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL2	;more of same
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL3	;still more of same
MC:ALAN;CUBE MAIL	;recent mail in reverse order

(I have also corrected a problem with the tabs in MAIL0 so that the diagrams
contained therein are readable once again.)
