Re:   "Pentominoes"...

   GABRIEL toy company markets a nice set of pentominoes under the name
"HEXED".  They are the makers of the puzzles "Hi-Q" and "PYTHAGORAS".  The 
latter is a nice set of "tangrams" if you  are interested in them.  You should
be able to get any of these in any well stocked toy store ( like Toys 'R Us ).
If you are interested in getting solutions for them, me ( Yekta Gursel ) and
a friend of mine ( Douglas Macdonald ) wrote a program on a microcomputer to 
solve any pentomino problem.  The description of the program appeared in
November 1979 issue of BYTE.  It is written for a COMMODORE PET, but can be
adopted toi any microcomputer relatively easily.  If you do not have access to
a microcomputer we can print the solutions out for you just for the cost of
paper and postage ( a few dollars ).  If you are interested please let me
know.  My network address is YEKTA@MIT-MC.
