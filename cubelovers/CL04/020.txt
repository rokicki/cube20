I just spoke to Ideal Toy. They are aware of the edge flip problem
and give a tool to do it in their published solution. However, it
requires 32 moves and they ask us to provide them with a shorter one if
found.  They also say they are unable to do a complete checkerboard
of any kind on C^4 and would like to know if we can do it.
