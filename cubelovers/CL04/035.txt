  Well, I finally got one (UPS from Boston).  I agree with the preceding
messages; basically, I could solve most of it with 3^3 techniques,
and work out a couple of variations to get edge halves together; then
if a 2-edge monoflip or exchange is left over, do an odd slice move and
recover.  Some of the tools are quite long, however; does anyone have
a short edge flip or exchange, or a short half-center exchange?
