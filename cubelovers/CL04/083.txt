  The current OMNI (Oct.) has mention of various "cubes" from Meffert, in
the Games section.  Doesn't say much, but has nice pictures.  The main one
of interest is the Megaminx, a cube-like cutting of a dodecahedron, so
each face has 5 corners, 5 edges, and one fixed center (which only rotates,
but does not move relative to the others), exactly as in the cube.  Scot
Morris claims the Cube has 10^19 combinations, the Revenge has 10^48, and
that the Megaminx has 10^69.  Is this correct?  Meffert claims the Megaminx
is harder than the Revenge, but I would bet it is easier, in the sense
that cube moves should move over easier, and do closer to the same things
as before.
