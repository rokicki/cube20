  The July issue is out, with an update on Cubes by Hofstadter.  Don't
miss it.
  Also, the first Rubik's Cube Newsletter from Ideal came.  It's an 8
page glossy, mostly about Cube contests and Ideal's new puzzles.  So
far, mostly an Ideal advertising sheet.
  I got a letter from Ideal which said that "Revenge" won't hit California
until August!
  Adam Alexander is doing a promotional tour for Ideal with his "Alexander's
Star".  He said it is not out in the East yet - we get the star, East coast
gets the revenge, and the meet somewhere in the middle.  He lives in N.Y.,
was (is) a mathematician, and has lots of Cube-like inventions and models,
mostly built out of cardboard so far.
