I spoke to a person at Moleculon and was given the U.S.
patent number, 3655201.  I sent for a copy and will report
again when I have read it. It will likely be several weeks
before I receive it so if someone is near DC and feels
motivated to get the patent sooner, please do so. I will
also check out the Patent Gazette and see if there is anything
of interest there.
