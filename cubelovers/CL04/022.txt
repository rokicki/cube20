   I shared your frustration.  I'm in L.A., and, upon calling Ideal's office here, I
learned that they are following a rigid schedule of TV ads first before
introducing the toy in any area.  Here in L.A. (and probably in the Bay Area),
the TV ads are not scheduled until mid-June!  Curiously, Minh Thai's solution
book is already in some bookstores here.

   Anyway, I wound up calling Games People Play in Cambridge, and
mail-ordering one ($15 + $2 handling + UPS mailing cost) using a credit card. 
A two-minute transcontinental call before 8 am PDT is about 40 cents.  I hope to
have my Rubik's Revenge in a day or so now.
