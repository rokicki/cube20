From The Nation, August 7-14, page 103 (a continuing column of Reagan's
slip ups, called There He Goes Again:  Reagan's Reign of Error):

           Reagan: Elizabeth Drew wrote in the June 21 New Yorker that
         in a White House meeting, the President lauded the inventor of
         Rubik's Cube as exemplifying the virtues of American free enterprise.
	 
	  Truth: Erno Rubik, the inventor of the cube, is a Hungarian
	professor living in Communist Budapest.
