Re:   Addition to my pentominoes message...

Sorry, I accidentally sent the pentominoes message to you instead of the 
CUBE-LOVERS.  

   What I wanted to add is that one can also get a set of hexaminoes, though
this is a little bit harder.  They are marketed in England under the name 
"Spear's Multipuzzle".  The set comes with a few extra pieces, but nevertheless
contains a full set of hexaminoes.  The quality is not as good as Gabriel's
"HEXED".
