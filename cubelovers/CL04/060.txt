Subject: Invisible group of the 4^3
To: CUBE-LOVERS at MIT-AI


The 4^3 doesn't have a supergroup in the sense of the 3^3 --
the orientations of the ceter cubies are determined by their positions.

However, there is one fairly natural adjunct group that people might 
try thinking about and solving.  A 4^3 shows 24 center cubies,
24 edge cubies, and eight corner cubies.  But if it were really
a solid cube chopped up by parallel slices, it would have eight
more cubies buried inside.  Call them stomach cubies.  The eight
stomach cubies form a 2^3 buried in the 4^3.  They move when you
twist slices.  Can people come up with tools to frob the
stomach cubies without disturbing the visible cubies?  What is
the order of the adjunct group?
