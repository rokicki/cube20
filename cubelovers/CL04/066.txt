Sorry, I don't have any answers for you.  I'm strictly a hacker and not a theorist,
but I always find puzzles such as the one you describe to be a lot of fun.  I
would like to suggest that whenever a new one such as this shows up the
announcement of its arrival includes a reference to where it can be obtained.
