  Dan:  Could you explain to me how you got the formula of you message
of 23 Aug.  I can see more-or-less what you're doing, but I haven't been
able to parse the formula.  Also, I haven't seen your notation before.
I take it that "U3" is equivalent to "D1'", except hold the D1 in place.
How do you represent half twists?  Only by two quarters, or is there a 
shorthand?  From a group theory perspective, is it easier to talk about
hypermoves than slice moves?  Will that also be true on the 5^3, 6^3, etc?
