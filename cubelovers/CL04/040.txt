To: cube-lovers at MIT-MC

Jeff Adams (MIT math graduate student) and another person have coauthored
a 4x4x4 solution book which should be on the shelves shortly.  I'll try to
get more information.  The 3x3x3 solution posters which are on sale at the 
MIT math undergraduate office, among other places, were designed by these
two cubists, also.
