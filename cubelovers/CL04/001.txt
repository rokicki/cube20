There is a conteset in the cureent issue of Games magazine called
Air Race. Its basically modeled after the type of puzzle where you
try to run through once and rack up as many points as possible
without retracing your steps. I am wondering if nay of you out
there subscribeto Games, and are trying the contest? What types
of scores are you achieving? Any info appreciated. (I would like
to try to find out if my scores are higher/lower than average)
			Thanks;
