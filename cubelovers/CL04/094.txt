To: Cube-lovers at MIT-MC
Hexominoes are easier to find than pentominoes.  If you treat four of
the basic trianglular pieces of the Snake puzzle as a unit square, a
24-piece Snake can be configured to make any hexomino.  Just buy
enough snakes.  If you want to break the rivets on the snake, you can
make pentominoes by removing four pieces.  In fact, I wish there were
a modular Snake consisting of snap-together pieces so that different
length Snakes could be realized more simply.
