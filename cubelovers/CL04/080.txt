  If you live in the SF Bay area, BESTs now has the Impossi-ball, as
well as most of the other better group-theory puzzles at fairly
reasonable prices.  Rubik's Revenge is $9.00.  The Impossi-ball
was in the Scientific American column; its the icosahedron-like ball
with 2 each of 6 colors (as Alexanders Star).  If fact, I think it 
is equivalent to the star.  It doesn't look as good, but the mechanism
is more clever; what's more, you can remove one face and use it as a
sliding block puzzle.  Has anybody seen the other new puzzles from the
column?
