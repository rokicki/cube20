I take it back. There is more to C^4 than I first thought. I encountered
a final move today and do not have the tools and perhaps this is what
DCP meant in his message of May 14th. The final configuration requires
flipping only ONE pair of edges. Can anyone explain this difference
between C^3 and C^4?
