Ideal is sponsoring another cubathon (3x3) on October 9 at the
South Shore Plaza in Braintree. Prizes will be awarded in 
various categories but unless you are under 40 seconds you will
not be good enough.

I understand that Ideal has sold about 22 million cubes but their
world-wide rights have not helped too much. They estimate that
3 times that number have been sold by illegal competition.
