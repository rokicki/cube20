  Megaminx, under that name, should be available at your local stores (you
don't say where you live).  It is out in the San Francisco Bay Area, and
L.A., I know, including in such chains as GEMCO and TOYS R US.  It is
distributed by TOMY Corp.  I have not seen the Skewb anywhere, except in
the hands of a couple of people that got it from Meffert personally; he
did not send me one by mail, though I asked.  He did send his Double
Pyramid, though, a nice version of an octahedron, cut as Rubik's Cube, e.g.
with centers. (The other octahedron, the "Star Cube", has no centers and a
lot of extra corners.)
