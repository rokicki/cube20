   At least 2 errors appeared in my previous message:
    In Minh Thai's 3-cycle, substitute "r" for "f" to do the permutation
reported. 
    In the Frye 3-cycle, the first "d" should be "d'".
 
    I thought I had a half center move:
    
       (r2 u2)2  =  (Fur,Bur)

   but when repeated, I got

      (r2 u2)4  =  (Fdr,Bur),

    so I realized that what I really had was the 6-cycle of centers:

      (r2 u2)2  = (Ful,Fdr,Bul,Bdl,Fur,Bur)   (I think).

  Oh, well.
