For those of you tracking the progress of Ideal's Rubik's Revenge into
stores across the country, it has made it to Texas.  Walgreen's drugstores
here in Austin have put them on sale for $9.99, which is the best price
I've heard of so far.  They say the regular price after the sale ends will
be $12.99, but stickers on the boxes show $15.99.
