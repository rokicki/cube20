The article could be salvaged without
damaging it too much.  Cube-Lovers
could be described as a group based
at MIT which communicates via
electronic mail.  All mention of
ARPA and even the word "network"
should be eschewed, and the nationwide
nature of Cube-Lovers should be
downplayed.  The rest of the
article can stand, as far as I
am concerned.  Although I think the
style is a little dippy, I'm sure
he doesn't want my advice about it.
