Subj: Diameter of the group

I just saw a letter on the list that talked about finding the diameter
of the group for 4^3.  This implies (to me, anyway) that somebody out there
knows something about the diameter of the group for 3^3. Since I just started
getting mail from the list, I missed any discussion that may have happened on
that topic, and would appreciate it if someone would send me the apporpriate
information, or tell me which archive the discussion is in.

	Thanx in advance,
	mike meyer
