I have been patiently(?) waiting for the 4^3 Supercube (Rubik's Revenge) to
show up in the stores in the Los Angeles area.  To my knowledge it has not
done so.  Does anyone know where it can be obtained in Los Angeles?  If it
cannot, is there anyone out there who will volunteer to send me one, all costs to
be borne by me?  Thanks for your responses.

Jerry Mendelson
