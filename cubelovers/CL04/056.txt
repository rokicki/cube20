   Has anyone seen a 4x4 cube anywhere in Orange County, or even L.A.?  I'd
appreciate any leads on where/how to get one.
   I saw on (a friend's) in Santa Barbara, but he got it in Boston.  I've
also seen solution books (e.g. Crown Books).  But the object itself is elusive.
   If you like the 3x3, I highly recommend the 4x4.  If you have a scrambled
one, I can solve it for you.
