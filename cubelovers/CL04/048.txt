Subject:  Some simple edge processes for the 4x4 cube.


** ** ** ** SPOILER WARNING ** ** ** **
This message describes some edge processes for the 4x4 Rubic's Cube.

My collegue, Marty Hiller, came up with two simple processes
which she uses to order edges on the 4x4 cube.  They are sufficient
to solve all edge permutations:

(FUl UBl FDr DBr)		(r U2)^4 r

(FUl UFr UBl BUr FDr)		(r U2 r' U2)^3

The ^n notation means repeat the process n times.
Note that these processes probably modify the center cubes as well
but this is invisible if you have already solved the center.
