Subject: Four dimensional cube solution and two dimensional cube simulator

Earlier this year I announced:
http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/Nteract4.html
a four dimensional Rubik Cube (2x2x2x2)  While that post referenced a
sketch of a solution, it seemed that a clearer, more explicit solution
was needed to show that the tesseract was indeed a tractable cubing
problem.
An explicit solution of the four dimensional analog of the Rubik cube
is posted at:
http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/solution.html
This page includes extensive graphics which are intended to make the
solution clear and visible.

Also, during the process of developing a detailed explaination,  I
realized that by using similar display techniques, a 2D analog of the
cube provided an interesting model of cube solutions.  This 2
dimensional 3X3 cube simulator  is at:
http://www.frontiernet.net/~jmb184/3x3cube.html

All of these are written in Javascript, which means they do not require
extended interaction with the server to manipulate.  They are read in
directly and then can be kept for running off-line.
