Does anyone know if the dies still exist? I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if the whole set weighs several tons, even if they are single-cavity
types. Tooling for injection molding is fiercely expensive! (Tooling for
a decent ("serious") plastic soprano recorder runs probably a third to a
half $US million, for instance. (Mostly bigger parts, a few very
critical tolerances, and far fewer parts, also.))
