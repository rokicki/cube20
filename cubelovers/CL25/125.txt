If static, generated images are acceptable, (i.e. if the pattern is more
important to your sculpture than its physical realisation in plastic),
you could achieve this reasonably easily with a ray-tracer - build the
cube model and situate it in a scene with three plane mirrors, or
perhaps models of some other reflecting objects for enhanced aesthetics
- perhaps even a glass topped table! A free ray tracer is available at
www.povray.org I have some source and sample images for cube models if
you are interested.
