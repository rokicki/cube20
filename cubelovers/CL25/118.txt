yes, this is essentially what i did.  i added automatic symmetry
reduction to my program (this was a challenge to program, but it
makes things so much more convenient).  so now the program finds
all minimal maneuvers up to symmetry, from which local maxima can
be spotted easily.

i did not find all minimal maneuvers for #91 (superflip composed
with four spot) nor for #117 in the quarter turn metric, because
these are too far from start (26q, 24q respectively).  so for these
positions, which are locally maximal, it suffices to find minimal
maneuvers ending with each quarter turn.  as you see, symmetry is
helpful here.  also, all the X symmetric positions have order 2,
so any maneuver can be inverted.  this is also helpful.

yes, this is exactly correct.  i will leave it to someone who's more
interested in "weak" local maxima to determine those.
