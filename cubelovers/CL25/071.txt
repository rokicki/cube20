    Not sure whether they're interested in mail orders, but it might be
   worth a try. While I have no connections with G.P.P., perhaps it
   wouldn't be out of order to give some info.:

    The Games People Play
    1100 Massachusetts Ave. (Abbreviation = Mass. is OK!)
    Cambridge, Mass. 02138
    (617) 492-0711

    Afaik, they had possibly as many as a dozen in stock.

Check your local puzzle outlet first -- Magic Jack may be pretty widely
available.  When I was in the hospital last summer, my father brought one
of these with him when he came to vist me from Philadelphia.  I don't
recall the name of the store there where he purchased it.

I still haven't solved it.  The first step would clearly be to just catalog
the 26 different cubies, but I haven't even done that...
