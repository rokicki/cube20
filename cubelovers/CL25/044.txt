Not to minimize the difficulty of the problem or the beauty of the
solution (quite the contrary), but the solution seems almost trivial
when viewed in the light of Dan's particular unfolding of the surface of
the cube.  The same comment is true of Dan's isoglyphic solution.

It makes me wonder of you actually saw Dan's unfolding in your mind's
eye, as it were, as you worked out your solution.  Or another way to put
it, did you work out your solution in 2-D or in 3-D?  It also makes me
wonder if there is any other unfolding that would lead as naturally to a
Hamiltonian circuit.  I tend to think not, but I could well be wrong.
