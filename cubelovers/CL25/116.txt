In short, I should not have included Big Ben in that paragraph, only Noon.

The long explanation is that both of these are in the center of the
usual supergroup, as is any position that differs from Solved only by
face center orientation.  But for the  Symm(x)=Symm(x c)  argument to
work,  c  must be in the center of the group generated by the union of
the supergroup with  M.  This is equivalent to saying that  c  must be
in the center of the supergroup and be M-symmetric.  Big Ben is only
C-symmetric.
