Subject: Cristoph's Jewel internal mechanism

The Christoph's Magic Jewel is a disguised Rubik's cube (cf. Metamagical
Themas by Douglas R. Hofstadter p.339 : Stan Isaacs's coloring scheme)
but what about the internal mechanism? Is it simply a Rubik's cube with
only edge and centre cubes or is the mechanism different from the
classic cube.
I haven't managed to disassemble the Magic Jewel yet.
