This brings back fond memories of the trip to CA for the first National
Cube contest back in '81...  us nine finalists were taken on a day trip to
Disney Land and we had a race to see who could solve the cube the fastest
in the line to space mountain.  As the line winds inside the building,
it is really quite dark, and we were on our hands and knees trying to
get whatever light we could from the running lights on the floor.

I don't remember who won...  but it was a huge amount of fun.
