        In my Cubic Circular 1 (Autumn 1981), I recorded that Wim
        Osterholt, of the Netherlands, had made and patented a 4^3
        which he showed me.  I don't remember it and I'm not sure when
        he brought it to London - perhaps Summer 1981? I also recorded
        that Rainier Seitz (product manager of Arxon which was Ideal's
        German agent) showed me some German patents and applications
        for the 4^3 and 5^3.  In Cubic Circular 2 (Spring 1982), I
        record talking with another person who had devised a 4^3
        mechanism.  In Cubic Circular 3/4 (Spring/Summer 1982), I
        describe playing with examples.  However, I don't recall ever
        knowing who devised the mechanism that was produced for Ideal.

        It was common knowledge that it was not Rubik's mechanism 

I have just come across Ideal's patent for its 4^3. It is US Patent No
4,421,311.  The inventor was Peter Sebesteny, and the original application
was made in Germany on 8 Feb 1981, so it may have been one of the patents
David Singmaster was shown.  It can be viewed at the IBM patent site from 

        http://www.patents.ibm.com/details?patent_number=4421311

One of the references cited by the US Patent Examiner was to page 29 of
David Singmaster's "Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube" - undoubtedly the remark
"One can imagine the 4x4x4 cube or the 3x3x3x3 hypercube.  The first might
be makeable but its group seems to be much more complicated.  The second is
unmakeable, but its group structure may be determinable."

The corresponding European patent application was taken through to the
point where it was ready for grant, but then allowed to lapse.  The next
stage would have been quite expensive and have required Ideal to translate
the specification into the languages of the European countries in which it
was to be in force.  And the US was not renewed when the first renewal fees
became due in 1986.  Presumably by then Ideal had lost interest in the
patent - they may have calculated there was zero chance of anyone launching
an imitation, given the number of 4^3s that had been left unsold.

I don't have ready access to information about the German application, but
I suspect it was applied for by Sebesteny on his own behalf, and he then
interested Ideal in it.
