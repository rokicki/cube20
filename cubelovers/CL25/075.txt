Some years ago (around 1989?) I made a computer search on this kind of
puzzle.

The idea was "is there a way of colouring the 27 cubies (and then remove
one) so that a 3x3x3 cube can be arranged (with sliding block moves) to
show all external sides of either of three colours".

Since a 3x3x3 cube shows 9x6=54 cubie sides at one time, and 27 cubies have
in all 27x6=54x3 cubie sides all "cubie sides" would be used in one
configuration each.

So - I hunted for the answers to:
1) Is such a colouring possible?
2) Which cubie would be nicest to remove?

My search showed that 1) was indeed possible, and that there is one
distinct way for the colouring (not counting reflections etc) and 2) It is
possible to choose a cubie to remove so that the space will be positioned
in one of the space diagonals for each of the three solutions.

If anyone is interested I can dig out the specific colouring.
