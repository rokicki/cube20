While it is true that most of the cube art on our web pages 
(http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeArt) is two dimensional and 
therefore pretty easy to make, I have made a few designs that were bloody 
difficult.  I'm rather proud of writing "WTS" on both sides of a hundred 
some cubes.  I'm particularly happy with the chessboard made of four 5x5x5 
cubes with a symmetrical design on the sides.  Some of my failed 
experiments were still tough to make, even if they didn't look very good.  
If anyone has any good 3d design suggestions, I'd like to hear them.

Hana, here is my favorite pattern for a single 3x3x3 cube.  There is no 
easy set of twists from solved to this pattern.  I had fun doing this 
pattern on a 5x5x5 cube, and you should be able to create an analogous 
pattern with all of your cubes:

   -------
  |\ * * *\ 
  | \ o o *\
  |x \ x o *\
  | * \------     
  |x o|* x o|
  | * |     |
  |x *|x x o|
   \x |     |
    \x|o o o|
     \|------
              
The same pattern should be on the other three faces with the other three 
colors.  My ASCII art isn't the greatest but I hope this is clear enough.
