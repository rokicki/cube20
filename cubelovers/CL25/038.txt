This is quite reminiscent of "Oddmaze,"
(http://www.edoc.com/zarf/custom-cubes.html) which is a creation by Andrew
Plotkin realized using Kristin Looney's "Custom Cube Technology"
(http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/Technology.html).

On its surface is a labyrinth with no branches or dead ends.  Each
facelet has exactly two paths through it.  In the "start" position, at
least, the path obeys the Celtic knotwork property (over/under
alternations).  It is really quite interesting, and well described on the
above mentioned page.

(This doesn't help answer your questions, but might put you in contact
with another that has given them some thought.)
