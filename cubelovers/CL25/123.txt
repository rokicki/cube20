Subject: depicting a cube

	With reference to Hana Bizek's reference to how one can show all six
faces of a cube, I found the following the most satisfactory.  View the F, U
and R faces along the diagonal.  Now imagine the back faces 'exploded' out,
i.e. moved outward along the axes.  When they are moved far enough, they can be
seen.  The effect is that the cube seems to be suspended in front of a corner
and the three back seem to have been projected onto the walls and floor.  I'll
try to make a drawing.

This is a bit crude, but it may be better when printed?  if one puts in more
horizontal space, it might look better.

Well, that's a bit better, but one can't get it perfect on an orthogonal grid.
