Subject: RE: 5^3 quiz

To my knowledge, the 5x5x5 was invented by Udo Krell. It was produced by
Uwe Meffert in 1983. I read somewhere that Dr. Chr. Bandelow had the Hong
Kong factory finish extra puzzles from previously manufactured parts around
1990, don't know if this is true. Bandelow is still selling this puzzle,
under the name "Giant Magic Cube". It also seems Meffert reissued the 5x5x5
one or two years ago, under the name "Professor's Cube". This new version
might have other colors than the original. I have seen the puzzle under the
name "Ultimate Cube" several times, the name "Master Revenge" however is
new to me.
Since Meffert is the manufacturer, the "most" official name for the 5x5x5
is probably "Professor's Cube".
