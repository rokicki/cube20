Subject: 5^3 quiz

I need to know the answers for these questions:
Who invented 5^3?
What is the commercial name?
How many cubies it has?

[ Moderator's note: There was a note last July mentioning "Rubik's
  Wahn (5x5x5) (maybe also called Professor's cube, Ultimate or Master
  Revenge)"--any other names?
  The number of cubies is obviously 98--why didn't you just count them? ]
