Two comments on the Magic Jack:

Apart from Magic Jack and Vadasz Cube, there also exists a german
produced puzzle called "IQUBE". Like the Magic Jack, this is a 3x3x3
sliding puzzle with 26 smaller cubes. Cubes have colours red, green and
yellow, and it is possible to arrange them so the entire surface is
either red or green. Yellow is possible with red or green centres. IQUBE
comes with a leaflet that suggests a total 12 different solution
possibilities. The puzzle is suitable for the blind, since the three
different colours also feel differently. I bought mine from Spielkiste
 (http://www.twfg.de/puzzle/default.htm).

A 2x2x2 sliding puzzle is mentioned in "Rubik's Cubic Compendium", in
the part that is written by David Singmaster (quote):
"The only such (three dimensional moving-piece puzzle) puzzle that i
know of is a sliding cube puzzle of Piet Hein which is so rare that both
Rubik and I recently re-invented it before learning that it had been
done by Hein."
There is also an illustration which shows a 2x2x2 sliding cube puzzle
similar to the small Vadasz Cube.
