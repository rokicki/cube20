Ah, yes, the orange stickers on the 5X ....    ;-)


Anyway, don't they have sticker sets in any colors other than in the
standard cube-pallette?  Black or grey come to mind.  Not quite the
optimal solution, of course, but it would still give you a useable cube.

(The cool bit about letters, of course, is that on the 5X5 face in
question, you could, say, put almost all the letters of the alphabet --or
some other personalized message(s) of your choice-- and give yourself a
little something extra to shoot for as you solve the cube.)
