Subject: Dogic

A while back we heard about the puzzle "Dogic", an icosahedron puzzle.
After playing around with it for a while, I decided to model it in
Puzzler (http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/puzzler.html), since I dare not mix
it up until I have some moves to work with :)

That brings me to the question, has anyone made up a notation for moves
with the Dogic puzzle?  Perhaps similar to the Megaminx (R++, R+- R--
etc) moves.  I have yet to seriously sit down and try to solve it, but
eventually I will find some time and a few rudimentary moves would be
very helpful.

Also, if anyone wants a physical puzzle to play with, Hendrik Haak
(mailto:HendrikHaak@t-online.de) still has some available (that's where
I got mine)

P.S. To those using the puzzler version, moves can be made along any of
the 12 axis in both minor (just the tip pieces) or major (the entire
slice) by dragging a cubie from one place to its eventual destination (I
didn't bother putting an entry for it in the helpfile).  Also, I had a
few requests for more detailed information on the puzzles and solving
them.  I have very nice solutions for the Megaminx, Pyraminx and Cubes,
but nothing written down for the Skewb, Masterball, or Dogic puzzles
(the skewb and masterball are quite easy so perhaps a solution is
unnecessary).  Any notes or information on these puzzles would be
appreciated.
