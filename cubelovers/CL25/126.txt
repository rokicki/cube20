Hi,

my first mailing on this list. I've seen some stuff, and thought it
too hard (at the moment). _This_ discussion, however, I can handle!


Another way to do this is in VRML. It's quite easy to build up a model
of a cube in 3D, including colors.

For a sample of what can be done with VRML in combination with a computer
program to generate the stuff, go to:

Follow the link about 'Triplets'. These are 3D models, inspired by Douglas
Hofstadter. I have included some examples on that page, as well.

It wouldn't be hard to do the same for a cube model. Writing a text file
with LRUDTB and ' in it to describe the model, then and generating VRML is
not too hard.

This has the advantage over PovRAY that you can really rotate the model in
space, and look at it in all directions.

The mirror idea is nice, but it will mess up the design (Left-Right swap).

More thoughts/ideas?
