After looking at a lot of isoglyphs and partial isoglyphs in the last
little while, I wonder if it's not the case that some of the
non-continuous isoglyphs are prettier than some of the continuous ones,
and that some of the partial isoglyphs are prettier than some of the
isoglyphs?

Continuous isoglyphs do *in general* seem prettier than non-continuous
ones, and isoglyphs do *in general* seem prettier than partial isoglyphs.
But consider the following two (counter?) examples.

The glyph

   000
   XXX
   000

yields (among other things) L2 F2 L2 R2 F2 R2, which is a non-continuous
partial isoglyph.  It looks about as follows (quite pretty and striking,
in my opinion):

      XXX
      XXX
      XXX

  0X0 0X0 0X0 0X0
  0X0 0X0 0X0 0X0
  0X0 0X0 0X0 0X0

      XXX
      XXX
      XXX



On the other hand,

   U B2 R2 F2 L2 U L2 F2 U2 R' B' R F' L' U2 B2 R2 B' D' U'

is a real mess in my opinion, even though it is a continuous isoglyph. It
looks something like the following.

      X00
      0X0
      XXX

  XOX XXX X00 00X
  XX0 0X0 0X0 0XX
  X00 00X XXX X0X

      00X
      0XX
      X0X


Notice that the partial isoglyph which was my first example "looks" fairly
continuous, even though it really isn't.  The reason it looks that way is
that it is continuous along all the edges where the non-solid glyphs come
together.  Call such a non-continuous partial isoglyph quasi-continuous.
I think your eye tends to ignore the solid faces anyway, so that a
quasi-continuous partial isoglyph tends to be very striking and very
pretty.  For example, there are a number of 4-H and 4-T patterns among the
partial isoglyphs which are quasi-continuous and which are very pretty.
