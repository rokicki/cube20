I have heard of something like "cubes for the blind". Probably either
have a different textured material attached to each cubie face, or a
Braille glyph embossed into each cubie face.

(Never tried to solve one blind, but I could probably solve on in about
a dozen or so glances. But for a while I worked on solving them with
my feet, after seeing someone do it on TV.)

[ Moderator's note: You'll notice this is a different topic.  Perhaps
  Wei-Hwa Huang should consider his problem "memory solving" rather
  than "blindfold solving".  I've heard that John Conway has a good
  memory method, I think requiring five peeks (cf Roger Frye, 20 Oct
  1981).  There are also several mentions of tactile cubes in the
  archives. ]
