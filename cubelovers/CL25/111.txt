Subject: New puzzle simulator
Date: Sun, 16 Aug 1998 11:32:28 -0400

I wrote up a puzzle simulator called Puzzler, containing the cubes
(2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, 5x5x5), a pyramid, a sphere, a skewb, and a
dodecahedron.  While not the same as a physical puzzle, its still pretty
fun to use.

Its just a beta version, just compiled yesterday, so there are bound to
be problems, and features that should/could be implemented.  Anyone
interested should download the program at
http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/puzzler.html, and let me know of any problems,
enhancements etc.

One of my friends asked me to implement the square 1 in the same
program.  In order to do so I would have to change a lot of the backend
code so I won't do so unless there is enough interest.

P.S. I forgot, the program is for win95, win98 and winNT.
