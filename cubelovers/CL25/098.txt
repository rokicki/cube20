Subject: Meffert's Challenge
Message-Id: <Pine.GSU.4.02.9807291459520.29412-100000@viking.cris.com>

I recently bought a "Meffert's Challenge" puzzle, and I see there hasn't
been discussion of this puzzle on this list.  Maybe it is new.  It is a
round Skewb, like Mickey's Challenge, but with different markings.  When
solved, it has four colored rings on it.  The triangular pieces each have
about a quarter ring on them.  Four of the square pieces have two separate
quarter ring markings, and the other two square pieces are blank (actually,
they say "Meffert's Challenge").  I think it is fun because in addition to
solving the puzzle, you can try to make different "snake" patterns on it.
It took me a while to figure out how to make a snake that uses all but one
of the segments.

I threw away the packaging, and I don't remember who makes it.  I think it
was Pressman.  I bought it at a toy store in the Supermall in Auburn, WA,
and they also had a normal Skewb made by the same company.
