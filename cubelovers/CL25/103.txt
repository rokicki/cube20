 yes, I just happened to buy both of these puzzles myself today.  They
 are made by Pressman.  It is interesting to note that the copyright
 says, "(copyright) 1997 Uwe Meffert patent #5,358,247" for *both*
 puzzles.  (same mechanism)
 They also are selling the Pyraminx in the same type packaging.  Is
 the Pyraminx also a Skewb mechanism?  (I didn't buy one since I
 already had one) Now I wish they would bring back some other puzzles!
 :-)
