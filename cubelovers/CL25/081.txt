Maybe you find the following pattern for the 4*4*4 interesting (I'm not
sure I am using the proper notation, but by Capital letters I mean side
moves, small letters are slice moves):

R r U2 u2 R2 r2 U3 u3
F3 L D2 L3 D3 F2 U2 F2 D L D2 L3 F
L3 F U2 F3 U3 L2 D2 L2 U F U2 F3 L
D F2 B2 D2 F2 B2 D

The last three lines alone make a similar pattern on a 3*3*3 cube. I have a
shorter sequense for it somewhere that I can't remember by head. One can
also make a similar pattern on the 5*5*5, I'll try and dig it out...
