I bought one of these from Games People Play and it is unsolvable on one
of the colors.  At least, getting the piping to wander all the way
around on the red colors was not possible.  It looks like one of the
stickers is oriented incorrectly.  I told the folks at FunTech and they
told me to send it back to them and they would look.  Also, when I
solved the message version I couldn't get the rest of it to line up.
Some of the pipes on the other edges didn't line up and it wasn't
possible to make the rest silver.  This was kind of disappointing.
