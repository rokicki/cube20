A mirror can be placed on those walls and floor so that the design's B,
L and D faces can be reflected off those surfaces. The design would need
to stand on a glass-topped table, so that the D face can be reflected
off the  mirrorred floor. The whole setup could be photographed.

Unfortunately, I do not have resources to implement this. I don't even
own a glass-topped table!

Here is a challenge for the programmers out there. Can you write an
applet that will slowly rotate my design in order for a viewer to see F,
B, R, L and U faces, then tilt it upward to expose the D face? Do these
moves any way you want, just make sure a viewer can see it all.Thank tou
very much.

You can find three of my designs at
http://www.ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif/cube.html. Two designs there are
cubical. Opposite faces are identical, both in color and geometrical
pattern. To wit: e. g. F face is exactly identical to B face, etc. This
property holds for a majority of these designs, but there are
exceptions.
