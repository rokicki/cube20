check out
http://members.aol.com/islandcom/
for information about the Vadasz Cube which is a variation of the Magic
Jack described above. I have a "3x3x3 Classic Cube Solid" and have been
able to solve it.
The Vadasz Cube allows you to easily disassemble it, if desired. Also, each
of the 26 cubies can be disassembled and reconfigured allowing you to
create variations of the puzzle. The cubies are made out of plastic tiles
so that you can re-arrange the construction and colors of each of the 26
cubies if you desire.

Five different puzzles are available:
2x2x2
3x3x3
4x4x4
and
multi 3x3x3
multi 4x4x4
