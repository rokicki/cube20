Back when i was still in college, myself and a friend would occasionally
perform our "geek party trick", which was that we would sit on the floor, 
back-to-back, and someone would toss one of us a scrambled cube. Whoever 
caught it would look at it, make a single quarter-turn on it, and pass it 
over their shoulder to the other person, who would look at it and make another
quarter turn, pass it back, and so on. We could solve it in this fashion in 
just under 2 minutes.
