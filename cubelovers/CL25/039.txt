 Am I missing something? The geometrical description seemed plausible
and fine, but unless I'm far off base, it seems that some quite-clever
mechanical design is essential. Fairly sure that Douglas Hofstadter
noted in passing (I think in Go"del (G"odel ? :), Escher, Bach...) that
a physical prototype of the 6^3 has been built.

 I have pulled apart and studied all "sizes" from the 2^3 to the 5^3,
and the innards of each are rather different; the 5 is based on the 3,
but the 4 (Rubik's Revenge) has a ball inside, as probably most List
readers know. The innards of the 2 are quite distinctive, again; (also,
borderline impossible to assemble/disassemble!). It's remarkable how a
simple increment of one, so to speak, has such a profound effect on the
basic internal design.

 My awareness of most abstruse corners of math. is quite comparable with
that of, let's say, a turtle. However, I do know modest bits about
formal kinematics, four-bar linkages, and some underlying principles of
the linkage variety of mechanical analog computers, for instance, so my
ignorance is somewhat better that that of a rock. I also know the
innards of mechanical calculators rather well.

 However, with such non-qualifications, I suspect that there is no
theory of such mechanisms as we find inside our cubes and related
puzzles. Mathematicians seem to be able to handle braids (Emil Artin?)
rather well, and knots seem to be doing well, but I really doubt that
there's any significant theory that can be used to develop a design such
as the innards of a 5^3.

 Ordinary geometry, I feel fairly confident, is of relatively little
help. One can at least define the geometry of the requisite constraints
and "freedoms" of motion, but to create the requisite shapes, seems to
me, requires a special and clever kind of mind.

 Honestly, I'd welcome having big holes figuratively shot through my
contentions! I'm sure I'd learn something.

 For limited (and probably very costly) prototype runs, the technology
that goes by various names such as 3-D printing, rapid prototyping, and
(ugh!) stereolithography should do well to create the shapes. (Seems to
me it's a fairly formidable challenge to a CAD program to create some
of the weird shapes, but I plead ignorance!

 (The "stereo" part of that long word is fine, but it's really
stretching a point to think of it as writing on stone.)

My best to all,
