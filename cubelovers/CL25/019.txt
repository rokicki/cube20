Subject: RE: 5^3 quiz

I bought my first 5^3 from a department store in Japan in 1985, while it
was alongside the 3^3 and 4^3 on the mass market.  Bought my second one
from Dr. Bandelow some time later.  In Japan it was called "Professor Cube"
which could be taken as "Professor's Cube" because it would be a bit too
awkward to pedantically insert the syllable for possessive form (in
Japanese grammar) between two polysyllabic foreign words.

(Tangential details:
pu-ro-fue-so-ru kyu-u-bu is 5 + 3 syllables, while
pu-ro-fue-so-ru no kyu-u-bu would be 5 + 1 + 3 syllables.)

The magic dodecahedron reached the mass market around 1989 or so.

Those were the days.  Some time around 1993, the mass market shifted to
computer games.
