Hi All

A new version of Charlie Dickman's Rubik Tesseract program and its
accompanying documentation is now available from http://www.tux.org/~bagleyd/
(under the heading of "Neat 4D stuff I wish I wrote" :) ).
This latest version contains a general solution to unscramble an
arbitrarily scrambled Rubik Tesseract as well as some improved bells and
whistles.  The solution is given in the docs and is also implemented in
the Macintosh program.

All mail about the Tesseract docs and program should be addressed to
Charlie Dickman <charlied@erols.com>.
