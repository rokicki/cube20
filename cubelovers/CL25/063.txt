I suggest people with 5x5x5 that tend to fall apart try and fasten the
small screw underneath the center caps. This might help, at least it did
on mine. Mine didn't fall apart though, it just got loose, and sometimes
the pieces between the corners and the centres would sort of make a
wrong twist. After i tightened the screws that problem disappeared.
