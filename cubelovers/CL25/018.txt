Yes, you are right - with my system AND a lot of time on your hands :) I
am pretty sure that the systems of other top speed cubists are at
least as as good as mine. The system is only half of the secret.

Nope. 15 seconds is not a long time to plan more than the four edges. Of
course, as you proceed, you will usually be able to spot the corners with
their appropriate cubies from the second layer in some nice position and
continue without delays ...
