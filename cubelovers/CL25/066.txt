Subject: New radio programme

TO:  FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES

        I am participating in a new weekly program called 'Puzzle Panel' on
BBC Radio 4, beginning on Thursday, 4 June at 1:30.  We recorded a pilot in
January and the commissioning producers were delighted with it.  There will be
a group of three to five panelists and we will discuss both mathematical and
verbal puzzles.  Some will be sent in by listeners and some will be set to the
listeners by the panellists.  At the pilot, the panel was myself, Chris
Maslanka (of the Guardian) as chair, William Hartston (of the Independent,
etc.) and Ann Bradford (compiler of a Crossword dictionary), but the membership
may vary.  I'll let you know of any changes of time/date, etc.
