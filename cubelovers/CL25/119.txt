Subject: New version of Puzzler
Date: Sun, 23 Aug 1998 14:30:24 -0400

The latest version of Puzzler can be found at
http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/puzzler.html.  In addition to the bug fixes
that were put in, I have added the most requested features, the ability
to take back moves, and the ability to enter move macros for cube
puzzles in standard cubist (UDFBLR) notation.

For those who haven't used the program before, Puzzler is a collection
of sequential movement puzzles including the cubes (all sizes from 2x2x2
to 5x5x5), the pyraminx, the impossiball, the skewb, and the megaminx
puzzle.

Enjoy,

-Noel
