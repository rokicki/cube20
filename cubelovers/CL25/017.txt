Subject: Jiri's system for solving Rubiks's cube

hello cube-lovers

For all of you that haven't been into Jiri's home page at 
http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif, you should realy look into it!
Bouth the method and presentation is of very high standard!
I bought myself a system in 1982 but I was so dissapointed that I
trow it In the garbage just after.  With the system I bought in 1982 
it was not possible to make it faster than 2-3 minutes.  With Jiri's
system it should be possible in about 17 sec.!

Ys Geir Ugelstad

PS: Question to Jiri.  How far are you able to do the foreplanning
the 15 sec.  before the time start to run?  Hopefully longer than
"Place the four edges from the first layer"?
