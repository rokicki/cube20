Although it's using your mind in a different fashion, you could
disassemble it, sort the pieces (takes a while!) and reassemble it in
the solved state. With any reasonable degree of care, you won't harm a
5^3, I'm just about sure.* Have a clean work surface. I have done it
maybe 5 or 6 times on mine (from Meffert, ca. 1987). If you have a cat,
don't even think of letting it in the same apartment or house while it's
apart! :) The insides are really quite amazing to see. The internal
"foot" that retains a corner cubie is an amazing shape.

 *A 4^3 requires much more care. The center cubies are fragile! There
was a message a while back from someone who's selling parts for 4^3s.

 To start the disassembly, align all layers (obviously), so it's a cube.
Then rotate one face, leaving the other four layers aligned. Rotate it
either less or more than 45 degrees, so that a left or right edge cubie
of the rotated face is aligned with the edge of the other four layers.
Plainly, it doesn't matter which you choose, because of physical
symmetry internally.

With the rotated face on top, pry up the left (or right) edge cubie,
away from the edge you aligned it with. Use your thumb, thumbnail facing
down. Once it disengages, the rest won't fall apart uncontrollably; a
few pieces will fall out, but most will need to be actually removed, one
by one. Study the structure as you pull it apart. Amazement is one
reason, and the other is to get a better idea of how to reassemble it.

Sort the pieces (it might take longer than you think!).

Your color references for rebuilding will obviously be the center and
corner cubies. Build one face completely, place that face down onto your
work surface, and build progressively up from there. The last cubie will
be in the same position you removed to start.

My 3-D sense happens to be extremely good (apparently hereditary), so I
had very little trouble figuring out what goes where and how. It might
be harder for some others.
