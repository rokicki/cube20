 Sorry if my memory's faulty, but I don't recall any recent mention of
the Magic Jack. This is a 3-cubed, 3-D array of 26 small cubes
constrained by an outer cage to slide past their neighbors. At first
glance, it looks like a Rubik's Cube, but immediately one realizes it's
quite different. It's about the same size. Disassembly looks impossible
unless the outer "cage" is cut. 

 As you'd expect, it's a 3^3 array, but with one position empty. It's a
3-D analog of the 15 Puzzle. The individual cubes are not connected in
any sense to their neighbors. While the moves in a 15 Puzzle are in one
plane and easily defined by amateur mathematicians, in the Magic Jack,
there are many more possible ways of moving a given cube to another
position.

 Also, not surprisingly, cube moves are strictly translational.

 The fun begins when one attempts to create patterns. Each cube has
specific surface markings. The simplest configuration creates an
exterior in which all cubes have a random, fine-grained, glittery
diffraction-grating-like surface. More complicated, and difficult, are
the colored patterns, which when solved, create (iirc) a continuous path
around the whole puzzle. There are three, I'm fairly sure; one creates a
message. Solving is made more difficult by the fact that most cube
faces are obscured by their neighbors.

 As to its intrinsic mathematical difficulty, I'm not close to being
well informed/educated enough to judge. The practical problem of hidden
faces does add to the practical difficulty, and the number of "degrees"
of freedom for a given cube (from 3 to 6, depending on position)
certainly increases the available choices.

 I saw this puzzle at Games People Play in Cambridge; it's a German
import. Quality of construction was good, although there was no
detenting, and it could be easier to move the cubes. It might actually
be easier to constrain potential interferers, and let gravity do the
work. The difficulty was essentially caused by other cubes' getting out
of position, not poor quality. Price in the store is $25.

 Not sure whether they're interested in mail orders, but it might be
worth a try. While I have no connections with G.P.P., perhaps it
wouldn't be out of order to give some info.:

 Afaik, they had possibly as many as a dozen in stock.

 G.P.P. also periodically imports 5^3s from Germany, perhaps not from
Dr. Bandelow. They have a nice collection of movable-piece puzzles.
