I have sent Rainier an html conversion of his file. With his permission
and approval I'll post on my web page
http://www.nadn.navy.mil/MathDept/wdj/rubik.html

Yes. MAPLEV5 (Mathematica's main competitor) released a 4x4 Rubik's
cube emulator (as well as a masterball emulator and a 3x3 Rubik's cube
emulator) in their "share package" included with the software. The
share package is actually free but MAPLEV5 is not! Incidently, the
emulators work on some older versions of MAPLE as well. The pictured
linked to on the bottom of the above-mentioned web page were obtained
using this emulator. - David Joyner

It would be theoretically interesting, IMHO, to have the expressions
rewritten using commutators but more confusing in practice to follow.
