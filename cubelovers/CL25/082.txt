Subject: New Puzzle: "Dogic"

I just received a new Puzzle called "Dogic - Test Your Logic".
It's in the shape of an Icosahedron, and moves in the following manner: 5
triangles can rotate around their common vertex somewhat like the Impossiball.
Each triangle is again subdivided into 4 smaller triangles which move
separately, i.e. one can also rotate 5 smaller triangles around the same
vertex. Thus there are 60 "vertex" triangles and 20 "middle" triangles, the
latter are in fact equivalent to the Impossiball. The "vertex" triangles
are unicolored, the "middle" triangles have three colours. The whole Puzzle
has twelve colours, one for each vertex.

  I count the number of distinguishable positions:

  20! 3^19 60!
  ------------  =  2,199110779324 x 10^82
   2 5!^12 60

I'm not sure these calculations are correct, but if they are, this Puzzle
is at the very top of Mark Longridge's "Great Cosmic Ranking List", even
above the good old 5x5x5 Cube!
The Puzzle is very well "Made In Hungary". A true must for anyone who likes
cube-type Puzzles. Available from Spielkiste/Germany, check out:
