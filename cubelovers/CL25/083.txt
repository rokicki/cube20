Subject: Puzzles newly available in US

I apologize that I don't have more information, since I am away from the
stuff that I bought and I can't look at the packaging.

I was in Toy Works in W. Springfield, MA, and was very surprised to find a
series of puzzles I believe are newly available in the US after a long
hiatus.  The puzzles are Pyraminx, Skewb, and Meffert's Ball (with the four
colored rings arranged on a spherical Skewb device.  I think only the Skewb
was called by its real name.  All were in the same basic packaging, looked
pretty authentic, and I think they all had Meffert patent/copyright info on
them (at least the ball did).  And they were all marked down from $10 to $6.
Not bad at all.

There must be more out there, but my nearest KayBee didn't have anything.
I'm not sure if Toy Works is a big chain or not.  It seems to be from the
stuff they carry and the size of the store.

Happy hunting.
