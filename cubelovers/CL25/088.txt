Subject: patterns on 5x5x5 cube

a while ago, rainer asked for patterns on the 5x5x5 cube.  here
are some i know (the hardest part seems to be finding the scraps
of paper on which the maneuvers are written).

standard notation uses  R  and  r  for 90 degree clockwise
twists of the outer layer and second layer, respectively.  i've
found it convenient to have notation for  Rr , so i use  _R_
(that is, capital R underlined).  i guess this notation is more
convenient for handwritten maneuvers, but not so convenient for
e-mail.  i'll use  _R_  to denote  R  underlined and

        _( F L U B ... )_

to mean that the whole thing inside the parentheses is underlined.

the first pattern is a "double" snake; it meanders onto each face twice.

_R'_  b'  _U_  F2  _U'_  b  _U_  F2  _(U' R2 F')_  u2  _(F U L')_
u2  _(L U' R' L)_  f  _D'_  B2  _D_  f'  _D'_  B2  _(D L2 B)_  d2
_(B' D' R)_  d2  _(R' D L)_

if i understand the terminology correctly, this is a continuous
non-chiral isoglyph with the pattern

     ...*.
     **.**
     .*...
     .*...
     .*...

i still remember that when i found this pattern some 10-12 years
ago, i saw the URF faces together.  then i turned the cube around,
and was surprised by how it continued on the other three faces.
(i shouldn't have been surprised, but you know how that goes ... )

i came across this pattern accidently.  then i went snake hunting,
and found several others:

snake 2
_(R F2 R2 U2)_  r2  _(U2 R2 F2 R' D' F2 B2 D R F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(U2 R2 F2 R' D')_  r2  _(F2 B2)_  L2  _(R2 U' D F2 B2 U)_

those two have the property that the two snake segments on each face
have the same color.  if this condition is relaxed, we also have

snake 3
_(R L' F U2 R F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(D2 L2 F B' D' F B' U' D F R L D' B2 L' F B' D')_
f2  _(U2 D2)_  f2  _(U' D2)_

this one can be modified slightly; change the U and D faces

        .*.*.        .*.*.
        .*.*.        .***.
        .*.*.        .....
from    .*.*.   to   .***.
        .*.*.        .*.*.

if only one is changed, then we get two separate snakes.

there's also

snake 4
_(D F2 B2)_  l2  _(F2 B2 R')_  R2  _(F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(U2 R2 F2 R' D' F2 B2 D R F2 R2 U2)_  r2
_(U' D' F' U2 D2 B U' D L2 B2 L' U2 D F2 B2)_


another interesting pattern is

U R' U' F'  _U'_  R'  _U_  f  _U'_  R  _(U F')_  F2 U R U'
_B_  l'  _D2_  l  _D_  f'  _D2_  f  _(D' B')_
D' L D B  _D_  L  _D'_  b'  _D_  L'  _(D' B)_  B2 D' L' D
_F'_  r  _U2_  r'  _U'_  b  _U2_  b'  _(U F)_

which gives a continuous non-chiral isoglyph with the pattern

     .*...
     .*...
     .*...
     *****
     ...*.

the same maneuver produces an analogous pattern on the 4x4x4 cube,
but there's probably an easier maneuver.  another isoglyph (also
continuous and non-chiral) with the same pattern is

R  f'  U2  f  U  l'  U2  l  U' R'  _D'_
L  b2  L'  _B'_  U  b2  U'  _(B D)_
L'  b  D2  b'  D'  r  D2  r'  D L  _U_
R'  f2  R  _F_  D'  f2  D  _(F' U')_

modifying this pattern is how i found the first double snake.
