I am curious how the local maxima were determined.  4-spot
composed with superflip was based on sort of an "extended
symmetry" argument, but what about all the others?

If I had to guess, I would suspect that you found all minimal
maneuvers for each position and observed that there was a
maneuver terminating with each quarter (respectively, face)
turn for each position.  Or equivalently, perhaps you found all
minimal maneuvers unique to symmetry for each position and
observed that conjugation of the maneuvers would yield a
maneuver terminating with each required kind of turn.  Was it
something like this?

(All you would really need for the conjugation argument, since
you already know that the maneuvers in question preserve the U-D
axis, would be to find at least one minimal maneuver ending with
any of {U, U', D, D'} and to find another minimal maneuver ending
with any of {R, R', F, F', L, L', B, B'}.)

It is interesting that you found strong local maxima in the face
turn metric, rather than just "plain" local maxima.  In my
experience, finding strong local maxima with a computer search
is easier than finding "plain" local maxima.  Finding "plain"
local maxima includes finding weak local maxima (where at least
one face turn does not change the distance of the position from
Start).  If my guess about how you are identifying local maxima
is correct, then your method would not identify weak local
maxima.

Finally, I have mused previously to Cube-Lovers that strong
local maxima in the face turn metric may be extremely rare.  I
think I might be wrong.  My God's algorithm searches in the face
turn metric have already turned up more strong local maxima than
I expected, and your search of the X-symmetric positions turned
up more strong local maxima than I would have expected.
