Thanks for the patterns,

the problem is - my 5*5*5 cube is scrambled and I have to figure out
how to unscramble it. I haven't touched it for 15 years.

I also have several hundred pages of hand-written stuff.

I have several 4*4*4 patterns. I wonder if enough people on the mailing
list have a (La)TeX system so that I can post the patterns in LaTeX
format.

Concerning this I need feedback !!

By the way, my last 4*4*4 cube starts to fall apart. Does anybody know
if it is still available ?

PS

Does anybody else have patterns for the 4 or 5 cube ?

If so, pls. send them to me. I will create a document in ps and/or pdf
format about
patterns.

[ Moderator's note: My sense of this is that short notes in latex can
  be made readable enough as text that it might be workable on this
  list.  Postscript and PDF are not acceptable in this medium, though
  they can be placed in the archive at
