I used the term "blindfold solving" patterned after "blindfold chess",
where two players merely recite moves to each other, using no actual
pieces or board.  

As far as "solving in the dark" goes, it reminds me that I have a cube
in which under certain lamps, the yellow and white colors are 
indistinguishable.  Solving such a cube can occasionally give a few 
trip-ups!
