Hi,

I have 6 Rubik's Revenge puzzles (in the original packaging) that I'm
considering selling.  If people are interested in purchasing one, send
me an offer (yanowitz@gamesville.com).

I apologize for the commercial nature of this post, but I've seen a
few other commercial posts.

thanks,
-- Jason

[ Moderator's note: Announcements of on-topic stuff for sale is generally
  okay, up until it starts clogging the list.  I usually snip any
  detailed descriptions of the auction process, catalogues of other
  products, corporate history, etc.--you can get that from Jason
  (though he thoughtfully omitted excess in his message). ]
