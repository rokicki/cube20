Subject: Web address for solving the 5^3
To: cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu

I have created a page with a description of how I solve the 5x5x5.
Please check out www.wunderland.com/wts/jake.  Although I did spend a
fair amount of time on this page, I certainly consider it a first
draft, and I would appreciate any comments about it, either those
involving clarity of the explanation, or even better moves that would
perform the same functions.  Be warned that it is a long page,
although I'm sure you expected that.

One person wrote to me and said that he had all but two cubies solved.
I suspect his difficulty was "parity" which I cover in my Sixth Step.
I'm sure there are many good solutions to the 5x5x5, just as there are
for the 3x3x3, so if you have a half-solved cube you may need to scrap
your work if you want to use my solution.

Good luck.
