Subject: superflip composed with six spot

another position to consider is  superflip  composed with  six spot,
since its maneuvers also have a corresponding cyclic shifting property.
until recently, i didn't know any 24q maneuvers for this position, so
i had planned to do an exhaustive search through 24q.  however, by
looking at the new 24q maneuvers for superflip, i was able to modify
one to get a 24q maneuver for superflip composed with six spot:

D' R  L' F  L' F  B  U' B  L' F' U  F' U  D  R' U  R' F' D  L' U  D  F' (24q*)

as a result, i only did a partial 24q search, namely for maneuvers that
contain a half turn.  up to cyclic shifting and symmetry, the only such
maneuvers are

R' U  D  R' U  F' D  R' B  U' L' U' F' D  F' B' D' R' F  D  F  D' R2 (24q*)

and a suitable reorientation of the inverse maneuver.  (the inverse
position is the same pattern, but in a different orientation.)

superflip composed with six spot also requires 20f:

U2 F  B' R  F  L2 F2 D  B2 D2 R2 B' L2 F' D2 R2 D' B  R  B2  (20f*)

no maneuver is simultaneously minimal in both metrics; this is a
consequence of the partial 24q search.
