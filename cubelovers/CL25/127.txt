Oh no! Please remember that those are Rubik's cubes. Their "physical
realization" is usually that they are stacked together to form larger
cubes. If *that* was all to the design problem, I wouldn't have the
nerve to make a posting to the cube-lovers msiling list. Some of its
members are first-class mathematicians.

I feel that an explanation of what I call the design problem is in
order. Ther goal of this problem is to create, by conventional cube
manipulation, a composite pleasant geometrical design on a set of
Eubik's cubes. The basic algorithm consists of three simple steps:
1} construct patterns on individual cubes
2} make sure that the colors match properly from cube to cube {color
control}
3} stack the cubes together.
You start with a set of solved cubes. If you have scrambled cubes, you
need to solve them. That is just one excellent reason why you *must*
solve the Rubik's cube comopletely. Being able to solve only one side is
woefully inadequate.

Don't  forget color control. Without it you don't have a design. This
unavoidable aspect of the design problem further complicates the design
algorithm. It is a little bit like chess. You try to consider two or
three moves ahead of your opponent to achieve a winning strategy..,. or
create a viable design from a set of Rubik's cubes.

The last step is easy. It is sort of like a three-dimensional jigsaw
puzzle. The patterned cubes you constructed are part of this jigsaw.

Here, in a nutshell, is a  description of the design problem. Please,
get our your Rubik's cubes and start twiddling.

Good luck,  Hana
