I greatly regret allowing the advertisement from Eddy Liao entitled
"cubes for sale".  Having just received his ad spammed in my personal
mailbox, I must conclude he is an abuser of the network.  So if you
buy anything from him, you're supporting network abuse, and for all I
know he may steal your money as blithely as he steals the network's
resources.
