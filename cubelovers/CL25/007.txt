Subject: Rules for speed-cubing

Hello,

What are the exact rules for speed cubeing?

I have seen that in the World-campionship it was legal to look at
the cube 15 seconds and then put it back on the table.  How long time
did it take from puting it back on the table (after looking) and the
real start???
