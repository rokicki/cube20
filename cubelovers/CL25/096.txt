Subject: 4x4x4 patterns
From: Rainer.adS.BERA_GmbH@t-online.de (Rainer aus dem Spring)

Dear cube-lovers,

Of course, HTML is the format I should have used. I'll try to get a
latex->html converter for NT.

Anybody my post the patterns in any format.

The R_123 means turn 3 slices - this is the same as turning L and then
turn the whole cube R.

This notation was inspired by Bandelow's usage of slice moves.  The
advantage is, it makes sense for any cube. The disadvantage is, most
cubologists don't accept these "moves".

I have checked all patterns on my (physical) 4x4x4 cube.

I don't think using conjugation and commutatotrs is very user-friendly.
The maneuvers are not optimized and anybody will be able to figure out
how they were constructed using conjugation and commutators, though.

As far as I remember the patterns were the last thing I did in those
golden cube days :)

Does anybody know of a cube simulator for Mathematica ?
