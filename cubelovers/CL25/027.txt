Hello, I am a fond of the cube of Rubik, but in my country it is very 
difficult to get it.  
She/he would want to know if you can give me information about where I 
can get the cube and their different variants.  
For the information that you can to give, I thank him a lot.  
  
Cordially:  Hader Mesa
