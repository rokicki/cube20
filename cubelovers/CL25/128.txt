This completes the list of strong local maxima 9f and 10f from
Start in the face turn metric.  I posted #1, #2, and #3
previously, but the rest are new.  9f is the shortest strong
local maximum.

I continue to think that all eight of these positions share a
special kind of symmetry that is related to the fact that they
are strong local maxima, but I can't quite get my arms around a
good description for this symmetry.  Generally speaking, they
look more symmetric if you look at corner cubies and edge cubies
separately than if you look at them in combination.  Also, they
look more symmetric if you look only at the colors of the
facelets (looking at two dimensional 3x3 faces) rather than
if you look at the location of entire cubies.

They do all share the following in common.  Looking just at the
colors of the facelets, all pairs of opposed 3x3 faces have the
same pattern for all eight positions. Hence, there are (up to)
three different face patterns for each position.  Also, if the
cube is colored according the "opposite faces differ by yellow"
convention, then the pairs of opposed face patterns for all
eight positions are the "yellow complements" of each other.
Finally, all the face patterns (and some of them are fairly
complicated, having as many as four colors) are symmetric with
respect a reflection across either a vertical or horizontal axis
of the 3x3 square making up the face.

Even though none of these strong local maxima are q-transitive
in the classic Saxe-Hoey sense, the "face symmetry" they all
share seems too unusual to me to be just a coincidence.

I think #8 is an especially interesting position.  All six faces
have the same face pattern, sort of a three colored checkerboard
(if that is not a contradiction in terms).  The position is
basically Pons Asinorum with the edge and corner cubies rotated
as a unit along a major diagonal axis relative to the fixed face
centers.
