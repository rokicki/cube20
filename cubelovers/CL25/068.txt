Subject: Re: Cristoph's Jewel internal mechanism
Date: Thu, 21 May 1998 11:02:57 PDT

The Jewel is basically an octahedron, but the vertex pieces are absent.
This does not make the puzzle easier. Apart from the jewel i also have a
taiwanese and a polish made octahedreon (with vertex pieces). A third
version exists, made by Uwe Meffert, but quite rare. The turning quality
of the jewel is very close to that of the polish made octahedron, so i
believe that is where the jewel originates (Correct me if i'm wrong,
Christoph!)
The disassembled polish octahedron has a mechanism very close to that of
the Pyraminx puzzle, also by Uwe Meffert. It is not a cube mechanism.
