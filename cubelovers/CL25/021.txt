Hi, I just found and joined this list.

So I am looking for any and all oddball cube variations I can find.
Does anyone have anything to sell or trade.  I can trade for a "Magic
Dodecahedron" which is the start shaped Hungarian version of the
Megaminx and I might be willing to part with a 5x5x5 cube for anything
really interesting.  I'm looking for an original Tomy Megaminx.  Also
the octahedron puzzle which is like two Pyraminx's glued together
(there might be an official name).  I am also searching for a 4x4x4
but I know they are really hard to find these days (mostly because
they tend to break).

The Dodecahedron puzzle is really amazing.  It was actually harder
than the 5x5x5 cube.  IT took me about 3 hours to work it out!  I
think once you know the 3x3x3 then all the same moves do similar
things and you can easily solve 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 with variations.  Of
course there are some cool things you can do with these.

I must say that I was disappointed with one web page that listed a
bunch of moves for the 3x3x3 cube.  I was trying some of them out and
thinking, my god, how did anyone figure this out, only to then
discover that a computer had figured them out.  OK, that's certainly
an interesting problem, but I have much more fun discovering them on
my own.  Interstingly enough, solving the dodecahedron led me to some
neat new moves for the original cube!

So where can we go from here? Have we made all the regular polyhedra
into puzzles?  Is there hope of actually building 6x6x6 and beyond
cubes?  Is there really any point to doing it?  I suppose they would
allow for some nice patterns. Does anyone know of any puzzles that are
not in George Helm's collection?  I just bought a Magic Cube puzzle at
Walgreens for $3.  It's a 3x3x3 with psychedelic stickers on it...
