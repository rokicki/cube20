This is easy to see if we consider that  Symm(x)  is the set of all
m  in  M  that commute with  x, because

         m' x m = x     if and only if     x m = m x.

At some times since 1981 I've wondered whether symmetry discussions
are better done with commutativity rather than conjugacy.

So if  c  is any element of the center of G* -- i.e.,  c  commutes
with all elements of  M  and  G  -- then  Symm(x)=Symm(x c).  As is
well known to cube-lovers, the center of the usual cube group consists
of the identity and the superflip.  In the supergroup, we may also
compose these with Big Ben (all face centers rotated 90 degrees) and
Noon (Big Ben squared).
