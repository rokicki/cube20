Note that all the glyph types which Mike lists (01, 02, 0D, 04, and 03 in
Dan's taxonomy) fix the corners.  Thus, his note below points out that in
order to have anything other than two solid faces opposite to each other,
you must fix the corners.

The correspondence between Dan's taxonomy and my charts is 01=BF, 02=AF,
03=A7, 04=A5, and 0D=BD.  As I said earlier, the identfication numbers on
my charts are not a taxonomy.  Rather, they provide a unique
identification for each of the 2^8 glyphs.

All three possibilities do occur in my chart.

This possibility does occur in my chart.

This possibility does occur in my chart.

Both possibilities do occur in my chart.

All  four possibilities do occur in my chart.

Indeed!

All three possibilities do occur in my chart.  In addition, I found three
partial isoglyphs of type 03 with one solid face.
