>Does anybody have some nice patterns on the 4^3 or 5^3 cube ?

I made a chess board out of four 5^3 cubes, which you can check out along
with our other cube sculptures on www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeArt.  If
anyone has any good pattern ideas for four 5^3 cubes, I'd like to hear
them, particularly before I peel off the stickers on one of them and give
it a color pattern similar to Colorspace created by Andy Plotkin (which you
can see at www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/CustomCubes.html).
