Back in February or so I became fairly active in the bulletin board at
www.rubiks.com.  I found the same questions being repeated over and over
so with the help of some people I took it upon myself to write a FAQ for
people.  Due to the type of questions answered I refrained from talking
about it on the cube lovers list, but someone told me to give it a try
anyway.  So here it is:

http://www.slamsite.com/chrono

or more specifically,

http://www.slamsite.com/chrono/other/rcfaq006.txt

It's just a very big text file.  Kept it simple to give it that "old
school" flavor.

Corrections, additions, comments, & criticisms are welcome.  After all,
what's a FAQ if it provides the wrong answers.
