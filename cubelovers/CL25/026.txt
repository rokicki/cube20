Subject: Eclipse and Pyramorphix

There are two new puzzles out,
by the two most prominent veterans respectively:

 1) Rubik's Eclipse, which is some sort of two-player game and,
    according to the people who have it, a real gem.
 2) Pyramorphix, by Meffert.
    David Byrden's Twisty Puzzles page shows a picture of
    a 2x2x2 Pyraminx together with the text
    "A solid version of this amazing puzzle is now available
    from Uwe Meffert, called the Pyramorphix".
    Now the 2x2x2 pyraminx looks like an old east german puzzle,
    which was a 2x2x2 cube in tetrahedral shape. The shape changed
    when the puzzle was scrambled, so the name Pyramorphix would
    apply. However the east german puzzle was not by Meffert.

Now if anyone knows more about these new puzzles,
or where to get them, please reply.
