Subject: Re: 5^3 quiz

Isidro,

Who invented 5^3?

At least I did. In 1982 I designed and built a 5^3 cube, all in plywood.
Although I did not aplly for a patent or other registration, as I was only a
schoolboy by then, the local newspaper recorded this event. As the wooden
prototype was not as speedy as necessary, I later designed a simulator for
the Sinclair ZX Spectrum (a then so called 'personal computer' with an
amazing 48K RAM memory). This simulator also included a 6^3 cube. 7^3 was
not possible as this did not fit in the screen, which was my parents
television set. Oh, those were the days!

Nowadays I am an architect.

Kind regards,

Sytse de Maat

P.S. If you happen to know other designers of 5^3, please mail me.

[ Moderator's note: Can you describe the design that held the plywood
  model together while allowing it to turn? ]
