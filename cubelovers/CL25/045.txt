Actually, I didn't visualize any unfolding at all, so I guess I
did it in 3-D.  Here's approximately the line of reasoning that
led to my solution.

As Dr. Singmaster notes, there is only one way to draw a Hamiltonian on
a 1x1x1 cube where all the faces are identical, and that is with a right
angle on each face.  Naturally one's first impulse is to find a path that
enters each 3x3 face in one place and exits in another -- and these two
ends must be on edges 90-degree apart.  One quickly sees that the two exits
must be on edge cubies, since if any were on corner cubies there would
be a parity problem between "inner corners" and "outer corners."  But if
they were edge cubies, then no Hamiltonian path exists (as the inner corner
must join to the ends already).

However, another extension is the "three parallel paths" pattern:  put this
on each face:

 A  B  C
 |  |  |
 |  |  +-D
 |  +----E
 +-------F
This leads to three paths on the cube, where the center one is the
traditional 1x1x1 Hamiltonian.  If this can be rearranged to a solution,
we must try to reconnect the ends so that there is some "interaction"
between the three paths.  C must connect to D, but we can connect A to B
instead -- and this leads to a solution, which surprised me when I
visualized it on a 3-d cube.  (I most definitely find visualizing in
3-D easier than visualizing the links in an unfolded cube.)
