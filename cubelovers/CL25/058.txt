the set of such patterns is what i called the "target subgroup" for my
optimal solver.  it is the intersection of the three subgroups
<U, D, F2, R2, B2, L2>,  <F, B, U2, R2, D2, L2>  and  <R, L, F2, U2, B2, D2>
(or the intersection of any two of them).

the position he mentions is in the square group (mark longridge gives
a minimal maneuver for it).  dan hoey remarks that the square group has
index 6 in this "pseudo-square" group.  christoph bandelow's book
"inside rubik's cube and beyond" gives a nice criterion for a pseudo-
square pattern to be in the square group.

bandelow's criterion (slightly paraphrased) is

     the four  U  corners must be coplanar, the four  F  corners
     must be coplanar, and the four  R  corners must be coplanar.
     (equivalently, all twelve sets of four coplanar corners
     remain coplanar.)

in fact, this forces the parity of the corner permutation to be
even (and thus the same for the edge permutation).

this reminds me of an interesting idea i had for a puzzle: a 3x4x5 box,
whose faces and slices are restricted to 180 degree turns.  this sort
of thing could also be done with any dimensions.
