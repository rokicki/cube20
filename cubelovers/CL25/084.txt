This run took about three weeks on a Pentium 300.  The next level from
Start is going to be difficult.  With the current algorithm and
hardware, it would take about thirty to forty weeks.  In addition, the
memory requirements will go up considerably.  Currently, I store only
the positions up to five moves from Start in memory.  To calculate the
next level, I will have to store the positions up to six moves from
Start.

I still suggest (see "How Big is Big?" in the archives) that the problem
can be calculated all the way to the bitter end, eventually.  The Cube
problem simply is not as big as, for example, Chess or Go.

As a possible strategy, if we could add one level per decade, we could
probably calculate the problem all the way to the end within about 100
years. Moore's Law (the power of computers doubles about every eighteen
months) suggests that such a schedule might be possible.
