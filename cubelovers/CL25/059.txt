Subject: Revenge and the 5x5x5

Since we all know that Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4) puzzles are nearly impossible
to find (all of mine have long ago broken) and the 5x5x5 cubes fall apart so
easily that they are basically unusable.

Well, as a solution to this, I took a Virtual Cube simulation and added
sizing buttons (the cube program supports 2x2x2 to 5x5x5 sized cubes), a
keyboard interface, and allowed it to receive sequences in standard UDFBLR
notation.  I also added locking of the center pieces to make using a paired
up Revenge easier.

The cube is located at http://www.mud.ca/cube/cube.html.  Any thoughts,
comments, suggestions about the program should be sent to:
mailto://noel@mud.ca.

Enjoy,
