Subject: Rubik's Tesseract Solution

Tom and other cube-lovers,

I have completed a solution to the Rubik Tesseract and have included it in
the program and it's associated documentation but neither is ready for
prime time just yet.

I was wondering if there was anyone who would be kind enough to review the
documentation and see if the write-up of the solution is reasonably
intelligible and provide me some feedback before I make it and the program
generally available. It is an HTML document (332K self-extracting-archive)
that you can read with your browser.

Thanks,

Charlie Dickman
