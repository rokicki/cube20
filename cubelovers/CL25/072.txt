 Sorry, all; the 'Net still has its surprises. Guess what: The Magic
Jack has its own Web site:

www.magicjack.com

They list the retailers who carry it; there are very roughly a dozen or
so. The site looks worth a visit.

Gosh, Alan, I guess we all should welcome you back, if my recollection's
clear! May you continue to be well!

My best to all,
