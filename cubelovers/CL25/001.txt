Wei-Hwa Huang replied to me:

Some puzzle designers do copyright their designs.

When one compares patents with copyrights, copyright makes sense.
Patents are intended for inventions that improve the quality of life
and will become important in industry after the patents expire, so
that the inventors starve.  Copyrights are for frivolous entertainment
like puzzles and photos, so they bring royalties for the lifetime of
the creator plus 50 years to the heirs.  One can only wonder why
patents were ever granted for puzzles.

Guess which part of that I was sneering at.

The Republic of China also thinks Taiwan doesn't exist as an independent
country.

No, my unbiased view was based on observations that I had made for decades.

Mr. Huang and I had this discussion in private e-mail already.  I didn't
know that he was going public with it too.  Anyway if I understand
correctly, Mr. Huang agreed with my point after that, so there's no
need to repeat the rest of the discussion unless I misunderstood.

[Moderator's note: In any event, further discussion on this topic
 should be sent to Wei-Hwa Huang and Norman Diamond, rather than to
 cube-lovers.  I somewhat regret passing _any_ of it on.  The topic of
 intellectual property and its legal status is vast, and has eaten
 bigger lists than this. ]
