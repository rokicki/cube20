Subject: spare piece for domino variant
Date: Fri, 22 May 1998 03:13:31 PDT

I just received puzzle from a fellow collector:
It is like a Magic Domino, but only about 47 mm along the long
edges. The pieces are red and white. The 9 red pieces have a
drawing of Superman and the 9 white pieces a drawing of Superwoman!
Unfortunately the puzzle was broken on arrival.
Does anyone on the list have a similar broken puzzle,
and maybe could spare a piece (edge)?
