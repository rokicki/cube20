I believe that solving the cube blindfolded in one shot is very difficult
if not impossible. One could memorize the orientation of all cubies and
their permutation. Then use algorithms for turning the cubes without
moving them, and then algorithms for permuting them. One would need to
define orintation of cubies on the cube and then the permutation
algorithms would have to preserve that orientation. This system would
presume one really long "peek" and excellent memory, of course :)

Using my system (http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif), I could probably
bring down the number of peeks to four with some practice ... Of course,
seven is no sweat.
