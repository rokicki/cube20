Dear cube lovers,

a few days ago I have subscribed to the list. I have downloaded all
the archives and also found some software (great stuff).

Some of you may know my name from Mr. Bandelow's book - I'm the guy
who won a prize with the shortest maneuver fro the super-flip-twist.

I always thought the cube is dead. Now I am really surprised to see
this completely wrong :) The level of discussion is really amazing.

I have are some questions concerning terminology:

What does M-conjugacy mean (this doesn't seem to be a standard term
from group theory).
[ Moderator's note: See "Symmetry and Local Maxima", 14 December 1980.
  This also introduces the group M and some of its subgroups, which
  are helpful in a lot of the cube-lovers discussion.  Jerry Bryan
  also tried an explanation of M-conjugacy on 3 October 1996.  ]

Some mails in the archives mention numbers like p102 for patterns ?!?!?
[ M: I believe Mark Longwood uses numbers of that form to catalogue
  patterns. ]

Does anybody know the current upper bound for God's algorithm (in q/f
metric).
[ M: 29 face turns, 42 quarter turns.  The best known lower bounds are
  20 face turns, or 24 quarter turns (both achieved by superflip).
  This was true on 13 February 1996, and I don't think there has been
  an advance since then. ]

Is there any serious research on the 4*4*4 or 5*5*5 cube. Computer
search is probably beyond available/affordable hardware :(

Are there any maneuver search programs that can handle slice metric ?
I think that slice metric makes sense since q and f metric have no
natural extension for "higher" cubes.
[ M: See 1 June 1983 for "Eccentric Slabism", a genereralization of
  the q metric that could be adapted to a f metric. ]

Does anybody have some nice patterns on the 4^3 or 5^3 cube ?
[ M: I reported some 4^3 patterns on 15 June 1982.  Have there been
  others?  Any 5^3 patterns? ]

I think I have some in my old (and thick) cube folder (paper,  not on
my PC :))
[ M: Could you type some in? ]

Some of these questions probably have been discussed already. Sorry, I
haven't read ALL old mails.
[ M: Note that I left quite a few of these questions unanswered--other
  replies are welcome, either pointers to archive messages I forgot or
  new answers.  But this highlights a major failing of the archives:
  We don't have a FAQ, or even an index to the major articles.  Is
  anyone interested in working on something like this?  I have very
  little time for it just now. ]
