Have I got an interesting puzzle to at least look at:


           GIVE or TAKE

You can take 45 from 45 and have
a remainder of 45. A trick, yes, but it
can be done.
           Give it a try
             It's fun


There is an obvious answer - You take 45 eggs from 45 chickens and you still
                             have 45 chickens left.
Can you find the other answer?
GOOD LUCK!
