I am interested in obtaining the following puzzles ( references are from
"Sliding Pieces Puzzles" by Ed Horden,  Oxford Univ Press, 1986):
  1 -  Change the Seasons, plate IX
  2 -  Inversion, plate IX
  3 -  Great Gears, plate X

I would like to trade for them, if possible.   A source where they can be
purchased would also be appreciated.   Thanks for any and all help.

The Future is Puzzling but Cubing is Forever,
