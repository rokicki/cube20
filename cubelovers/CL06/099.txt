There are interlocking devices that make the puzzle a "SLIDING BLOCK"
sequential motion puzzle.
    
The puzzle is on sale now in the UK and probably will not see US or
europe distribution for Xmas 1988.

There are solution book already in print.

Christoph Bandelow tells me that the puzzle is not particular
challenging and that he does not expect it to be a great success.
