Subject: Cube opinions needed

My friend's group is looking at buying a NeXT.  Unfortunately, they do not have
the opportunity for hands-on evaluation and are looking for all the opinions
the can get to help them make their decision.  If you have an opinion, be it
good, bad, or ugly, please send it to:

       arnold@freezer.it.udel.edu
