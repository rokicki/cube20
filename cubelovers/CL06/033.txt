SUBJECT :  Review of "Cubism For Fun" newsletter; the newsletter of the "Dutch
Cubists Club"


1.   The dutch cubists club is alive and well.   It is probably the only
organized group of people still collecting and distributing information about
Rubik's cube and related combinatorial and geometrical puzzles.  

2.  This spring in order to improve contacts between cubists they started
publishing their newsletter in english (issue #14 dated 3/87).  The newsleter is
distributed free to members of the club.   Membership for 1987 is  US$5.   A
photocopied set of the newsletters, issues 1-13, written in DUTCH is also
available for  US$7.    To order either of these send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER to: 
Anton Hanegraaf,  Heemskerkstraat,  6662 AL ELST,  The Netherlands.
