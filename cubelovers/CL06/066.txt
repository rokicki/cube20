    I picked up a "deluxe Rubik's Magic" at Games People Play the other day.
    It is a twelve-square magic.  Has anyone solved this guy yet?  My wife
    has been hacking on it some and and has managed to run it from the
    starting state (2x6) to the target state (as in the normal Magic, but
    moreso), but not enough comprehension of it all yet to get all the
    circle pieces in the right places, yet.

Well, /my/ wife solved it. 

    It seems to be more fun that the normal magic because if you ignore
    the circles you can make a bunch of interesting shapes (the big-hollow-
    square was neat to blunder into).

You bet!  As a matter of fact the order-6 puzzle is so much more fun 
than the order-4 that I am wondering whether higher orders might be 
even more fun.  In my opinion the order-4 cube was /less/ fun than the 
order-3, and it's a pleasure to see a puzzle where bigger really is
better.

Jenny and I have a conjecture that if a given flat shape is possible,
a flat shape that is derived from the possible one by moving a single
square one step diagonally -- is impossible.  There is probably a parity
argument lurking somewhere that can prove this.

Is a similar puzzle with triangular tiles possible?
