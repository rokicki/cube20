HI CUBE-LOVERS, 

If you enjoyed Rubik's magic you might enjoy "BETCHA CAN'T!, FLEXIBLE HEXAGON"
 This puzzle is constructed like magic, ie, with panels jointed by nylon fishi
line.  It is made up of 6 hexagon panels that are jointed on 2 edges.  The
panels can be manipulated from a hexagon (6 panels around a hexagon hole) to a
2x3 grid.  I didn't buy mine but the price label looks like it was from Toys R
