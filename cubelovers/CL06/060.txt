Subject: More Expensive Cubes


To anyone out there:

I am currently involved in a research project on the Rubik's Cube and expert
solving of it.  The conventional cubes sold in most stores fall apart in the
hands of the expert, because corners catch.  For awhile there were cubes
manufactured that have tiles for colored plates.  We have one of these, but
would like to have some more.  If anyone knows where we may look for these
cubes or has access to these cubes, please notify me.

								Thank you,
