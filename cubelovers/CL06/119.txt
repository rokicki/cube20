pbeck>   RUBIK'S CUBE IN 44 MOVES:  HANS KLOOSTERMAN

I guess that's on an algorithm to always solve the cube in at most 44
moves. Is that right? Is that the best known algorithm (best = has
minimum maximum number of moves)? Singmaster gives a broad outline of
Thistlethwaite's algorithm in his "Notes on Rubik's 'Magic Cube'".
That algorithm would always solve it in 52 moves, and I know that has
been improved to 50 moves. Is this new algorithm something like
Thistlethwaite's algorithm or is it working in a different way?
