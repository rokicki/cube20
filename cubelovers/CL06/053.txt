I am interested in information on the "Pastime Puzzles"  (jigsaw puzzles) made
by Parker Brothers in 1932/33/ and other puzzles of similar construction .  The
ones I have were sold by the Kohler Puzzle Exchange, 105 Roseville Ave, Newark
NJ  and if anybody has information on this firm I would also like the reference.

These puzzles are of the type currently being manufactured by "Stave", ie,
many pieces have shapes (eg, numbers, violins, fruits),  false corners and
edges, cuts where the colors change, etc


The Future is Puzzling but Cubing is Forever,
