I would like to hear from anybody who has visited a "MAZE" amusement center or
read an article, hopefully with pictures on same.   

I understand that there are 20 such centers in Japan and that the "MAZE PRODUCTS
COMPANY" (a NOB enterprise) is going to bring it to the USA.  

Nob's centers have mazes designed by a New Zealander, Stuart Landsborough and
puzzle shops that sell Nob's puzzles.  There was also an article in the dec 86
Sci Amer, pg140 on Labryinths which referenced a book called "Celebration of
Mazes" available from Minotaur Designs, 247 Montgomery st, Jersey City, NJ 07302
for $9.  Has anybody read this?  Are these phenomina the same?  Are the MAZES
coming !!!
