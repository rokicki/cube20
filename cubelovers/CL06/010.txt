I am taking a trip to Wash DC the week of April 13 and expect to have some extra
time while there to pursue puzzling.  If anybody out there knows of a good
puzzle store or possible an exhibit I would greatly appreciate the reference.

PS In FEb an article was published in TELECRAN , author Henri Leyder, titled
"610 Denkspiele im Regal"  about Marcel Gillen's puzzle collection.  The article
had several black an d white pictures of his puzzle collection.  The article is
in german, which I do not read, so I cannot paraphrase it.
