Subject: WANTED: references on the game of dominoes
 
I am looking for references on computer implementations of the game of
dominoes.  I suspect there are many variations on the rules for this game,
but any pointers to papers, commercial products, Ph.D. theses :-), etc.
would be much appreciated.  Please reply by mail.
