RE:  MEFFERT

I received amil from meffert yesterday, 1/22/87.  He says "he will be releasing
later this year the 'I.Q. DIE" ( which is the Skewb with Die markings on the
corner pieces), and a GAME called 'KING/ACE (which uses the Pyraminx tetrahedron
dercorated in the 4 card suits and truncated by removing the four apexes.  The
game is similar to black jack.  They are  available for US$25 each including
registered airmail postage.  He also has standard Skewbs available for US$16.

The mailing included a 2-sided glossy color flyer with pictures of various
puzzles.  The ones new to me are:  The Crystal Ball -  it looks like a
Babylonian Tower on a sphere with the capablity to move groups of balls at one
time;  Space Grenade -   a cylindrical version of the crystal ball.
