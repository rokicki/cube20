The recent spate of messages to Cube-Lovers having to do with wordplay,
numerology, etc. was caused by an automatic feed from some usenet newsgroup
for puzzle fans.  This was set up without without asking
Cube-Lovers-Request's permission or even informing us that it had been
done.  I believe that I have now arranged for the feed to be terminated, so
there shouldn't be any more such messages.

If you were actually interested in some of the things that were sent, you
can probably arrange to subscribe to the newsgroup directly.  But please
don't ask me how to do it, I haven't even been able to get anyone to tell
me the -name- of the newsgroup in question!
