-->   CUBE  MUSEUM  <--

On April 29, 1988 a museum devoted to Rubik's cube opened in  Grand Junction,
CO.   The museum is run by  Cecil Smith and is located in his home at 329 Ouray
Ave;  245-6734.

Cecil is primarily a documentor of pretty patterns and has 4,900 cubes in his
collection.  SO when in Grand Junction don't miss this one of a kind museum.  If
you know of or have something that should be in this museum please contact
Cecil.

REFERENCE:  The front page of the May 1, 1988  issue of the Grand Junction, Co
Daily Sentinel (Vol 96, No 153).

the future is puzzling,
but  CUBING is forever !!
