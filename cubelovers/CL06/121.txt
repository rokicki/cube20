Tactile
Teasers  [including more variations on Rubik's cube than I've ever
seen before]

THEM  by Jerry Slocum and Jack Botermans ($20), [wash univ press,
available from slocum or myself.  The reprint of the HOFFMAN book is

 The exhibit discusses
        The Art in Puzzles
        The Social Experience
        Cultural Values
        Puzzles in the Industrial Age
        Puzzles in Education
        Puzzles and Science
 It aims "to explore the history, meanings, and design of mechanical
puzzles."  The extensive displays categorize puzzles according to
their
object:
        Put-Together Puzzles
        Take-Apart Puzzles
        Interlocking Solid Puzzles
        Disentanglement Puzzles
        Sequential Movement Puzzles
        Puzzle Vessels
        Dexterity Puzzles
        Vanish Puzzles
        Impossible Object Puzzles
        Folding Puzzles
Puzzles have been lent by collectors and museums around the world.
 The
exhibit consultants are Benjamin Kilborne and Martin Gardner.
 
There are hands-on puzzles, but too simple and too few.  It's a
wonderful and tantalizing display of puzzles.  I was SOOO frustrated
not
to be able to handle all the beautiful, enticing pieces.  Of course,
if
I had been permitted to, I would never leave....
