I have been reviewing issues of the "CUBIC CIRCULAR" ,a set of which I recently
obatined form Singmaster, and would like references to  information on the
following:

1-   a book Rubik edited called  "A BUVOS KOCKA"  which was to be also done in
english by PENGUIN.

2 -  Rubik's newsletter "RUBIK'S - LOGIC AND FANTASY DIMENSIONS"

3-  "TEN BILLION BARREL" puzzle invented by Gumpei Yokoi.  Possibly a reference
to a published?? solution by Trevor Hutton.  This is supposed to be harder than
the cube and is available for about $6 at Child World in northen NJ.

4 -  "TRILLION" a flat version of 3.
