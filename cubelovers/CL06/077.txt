    Please put me on the CUBE-LOVERS mailing list.
    (Sorry if this goes to the whole list, but the -request address
    does not seem to work!)

Let's not start any rumors.  Cube-Lovers-Request works just fine.  I added
you to the list three days ago, and I mailed you an acknowledgment at that
time.  Perhaps some mailer between here and there ate my message for lunch,
but I certainly can't help that.  

Cube-Lovers is an extremely low-volume mailing list these days, so the fact
that your mailbox didn't immediately fill with Cube-Lovers mail means
nothing.  (The previous Cube-Lovers mail was sent last December 11th.)
