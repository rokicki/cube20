CUBE PATENTS:

The best overall discussion of cube patents is in Metamagical
Themas,pg 356; D Hofstadter.  Hofstadter says "that the real reason
the Rubik-Ishige Cube took off was that it could be manufactured and
that it did hold together".   In Puzzles Old and New,
Slocum&Boetermans it is stated that the courts gave the US patent
rights to Nichol's.   The is a further discussion of Rotary Puzzle
patents in Doug Engel's self published book "Circle Puzzler's Manual".

If anybody has further patent details please send me citations or even
rumors.  Of especial interest is information on the granting of the US
rights to Nichol's.

I've added some more details to the patent section.
