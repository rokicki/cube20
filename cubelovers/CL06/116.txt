Subject: an interesting talk


Stu Coffin, internationally known puzzle designer, will be speaking
to the Philomorphs (form-lovers) Society at Harvard next Monday
Dec 4 at 7:45 pm (Carpernter Center, Studio 2 west).
He will be talking about his new book, :The Puzzling World of
Polyhedral Dissections", and about his bizarre and clvere puzzle
designs in general. Better yet, there will probably be examples of his
work to puzzle around with. Stu's puzzles are just amazing; they combine
an amazing intuition for geometric structure with excellent craftsmanship;
they aree really worth seeing if you like puzzles, geometry, or just
nifty design and execution. See you there!!
cheers, roy
