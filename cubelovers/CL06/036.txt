I was waiting for someone in the recent discussion on palindromes to
refer to this book but no one did ...
	PALINDROMES & ANAGRAMS  Howard W. Bergerson, Dover 1973.
It has hundreds of palindromic sentences longer than those posted, as
well as palindromic poetry, etc.  No section on palindromes
constructed of palindromic letters, though.
