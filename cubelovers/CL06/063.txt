I SAW IN THE STORE THE OTHER DAY A GRAPHICS VARIATION OF "MAGIC" FROM MATCHBOX.
IT IS CALL ED RUBIK'S MAGIC CUBE.  THE OBJECT IS TO MAKE THREE DIMENSIONAL 
SHAPES THAT ARE IN HARMONY WITH THE ALTERNATE GRAPHICS.  ANYBODY OUT THERE
INVESTIGATE THIS VARIANT OR THE MAGIC GAME?  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY IMPRESSIONS.

A REMINDER!!!   FOR ALL OF YOU BOSTON PEOPLE, THE PUZZLE EXHIBIT STILL HAS SOME
TIME TO RUN AT THE MIT MUSEUM BRFORE FADING IN TO NEVER NEVER LAND - SO GET OUT
AND SEE IT.  I THINK YOU HAVE UNTIL JAN.
