<< 
<<Attention Directors, Managers, Analysts, Consultants, Programmers,
<<Technical Writers, Trainers, and Librarians!
<< 
<<The higher education computing scene in the 1990s will present exciting
<<challenges.  To accommodate users' needs, computing service organizations
<<are now visibly transforming in function and structure.  The widespread
<<adoption of personal computing by all disciplines, the increasing demand
<<for desktop access to shared resources, the growth in demand for
<<supercomputing capabilities, and the proliferation of powerful desktop
<<workstations exert irresistible forces on central computing services.
<<In response, the central site grows exponentially in staff and machinery
<<at one academic institution; at another, the computing center is disbanded
<<to provide distributed computing!  At some sites increasing specialization
<<is urged; at others, generalization is required.  Regardless of the
<<transforming strategy adopted by an individual institution, one fact
<<seems clear:  the user is the center toward which all computing services
<<are directed.
<< 
<<SIGUCCS '90 invites you to participate in the examination and discussion
<<of the myriad challenges facing user services professionals as we enter a
<<new decade and of the new centerings computing service organizations are
<<discovering to meet them.  Please join us!

<< 
<<Presentation Topic Areas
<< 
<< 
<<Information Exchange Technology
<< 
<<Information exchange may well be the most important computing
<<activity of the 1990s. The infrastructure for information delivery, the
<<National Research and Academic Network (NREN), is presently being developed.
<<How do we meet the challenges of a world where the
<<facilitation of information delivery may be a principal user services
<<responsibility?  Topics of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	new approaches to information exchange
<< 
<<	campus activity in implementing information exchange
<<	facilities that comply with emerging international standards
<< 
<<	research and development of computer-mediated information
<<	exchange methods
<< 
<< 
<<Distributed Services
<< 
<<As the role of user services shifts to providing distributed support,
<<we must create new ways of providing traditional services as well as
<<designing new services.  Topics of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	providing support staff in departments and colleges
<< 
<<	funding issues
<< 
<<	if and how to charge back for services
<< 
<<	human networking of distributed support staff
<< 
<<	nonlabor-intensive support strategies
<< 
<<	cooperative efforts with other departments
<< 
<< 
<< 
<<Management Strategies
<< 
<<How do user services managers cooperate with other administrative and
<<academic units that use or provide computing resources?  How do they
<<meet the many and diverse demands?  Topics of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	reorganization
<< 
<<	interaction with faculty advisory groups
<< 
<<	delegating and distributing responsibility
<< 
<<	coordinating university computing resources
<< 
<<	staff professional development
<< 
<< 
<<Marketing your Services
<< 
<<Changing roles may require changing your services and, often, your image on
<<campus as you provide new services to new users.  Topics of particular in-
<<terest include:
<< 
<<	promotional strategies
<< 
<<	conducting market research
<< 
<<	designing services for unique or special audiences
<< 
<< 
<< 
<<Strategies for Small Schools
<< 
<<How can a small liberal arts college have distributed user services and
<<centralized user services?  How do distributed and centralized services work
<<together to provide computing services beyond word processing?  The
<<sciences have become computer literate; now, how do we reach out  from the
<<center to the humanities and fine arts?  Are we getting out of the
<<office and into the trenches?  Are we making too many "house calls"?
<<Should we make them at all?
<< 
<< 
<<Security and Ethics
<< 
<<As electronic mail and conferencing become more popular, computing
<<systems are widely accessible to more users.  How secure should academic
<<computing resources be?  What are the ethical guidelines provided for users
<<of electronic mail and conferencing systems?  Topics of particular interest
<<include:
<< 
<<	promoting responsible and ethical use of computing resources
<< 
<<	security strategies
<< 
<<	adopting an ethics policy
<< 
<< 
<<Serving New Audiences
<< 
<<People from the humanities, the arts, and other traditionally nontechnical
<<disciplines are discovering that computers can help in areas other than
<<word processing.  In an increasingly proactive stance in the central
<<computing facility, what do we do to attract and support these new audi-
<<ences?  Topics of interest include:
<< 
<<	providing information about off-the-shelf specialized
<<	programs for music, fine arts, and the humanities
<< 
<<	facilitating technical support of nontraditional areas
<< 
<<	serving the computing beginner who wants to do
<<	sophisticated tasks
<< 
<< 
<<Consulting, Training, and Documentation
<< 
<<Supporting those who use the computing resources that we provide re-
<<mains an important responsibility of user services organizations.  Topics
<<of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	new approaches to training
<< 
<<	providing distributed consulting
<< 
<<	documentation distribution services
<< 
<< 
<<and/or other topics that would be of interest to your national
<<and international colleagues
