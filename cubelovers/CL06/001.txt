Perhaps someone on this list can help me locate an item that appeared in
the Mathamatical Games section of Scientific American.  If memory
serves, the primary subject of the article was Erno Rubik and the
Hungarian School of Architecture.  The particular item I am looking for
is a puzzle that waas given to entering students.  They were shown a
picture of a monument and were told to duplicate it using paper and
scissors.  The article contained the picture.  Can anyone give me the
issue that this appeared in?

And while we're at it, does any have a machine-readable copy of the
current rules for Eleusis?  If not, the issue they last appeared in.

          Thanks much,
          Paul <Schauble -at MIT-Multics>
