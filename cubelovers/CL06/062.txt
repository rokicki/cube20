MY MAILER SAYS THAT YOUR ADDRESSES ARE VALID BUT I SUSPECT THAT MY MSGS ARE
NOT GETTING THROUGH.  I AM TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  IF YOU HAVE ANY
SUGGESTIONS (MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS AT YOUR END) THEN HELP ME.  I HAVE RECEIVED
YOUR PREVIOUS MSGS.

SORRY CUBE LOVERS FOR THIS PERSONAL MSG.

PS  THE DELUXE CUBES YOU WANT ARE ON THE WAY.

PETE BECK  <PBECK@ARDEC.ARPA>
