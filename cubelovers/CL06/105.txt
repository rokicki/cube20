CUBING is back??

I here from europe (the Nuremberg Toy fair) that Rubik's Cube is back
as the 'MATCHBOX CUBE" (Rubik's is associated with Matchbox Toys).  I
presume that Ideal toy owns the trademark to Rubik's cube but not the
patent.  

The cubes displayed are standard 3x3x3 cubes with Rubik's signature
and silhouette on the center cubie (center moves will now be
required).

Anybody out there know anything more about this?

THE FUTURE IS PUZZLING,
BUT CUBING IS FOREVER
