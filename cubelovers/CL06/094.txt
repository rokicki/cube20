From the 'Los Angeles Times', July 26, 1988:

  So you figured out Rubik's Cube, eh?  Well, get ready for
  Rubik's Clock -- a puzzle the Hungarian professor says he 
  hasn't even solved yet, a spokeswoman for the toy company
  marketing the product said Monday.  But Erno Rubik's failure
  has not arisen from a lack of ability, merely a lack of time
  to puzzle out the secrets of Rubik's Clock, said Melanie 
  Bateman of Matchbox Toys Ltd.  "Really, it's not because it's
  impossible, he's just too busy to take the time to do it,"
  she said, adding that the new toy will be launched at a major
  London toy store on Saturday.  What can you expect to pay for
  more hours of mental anguish?  About $12, Bateman said.
