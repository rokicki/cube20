Subject: the 3x3

I took some time off this week and began playing with the cube to
teach one of my kids how to solve it. I had not tried for perhaps 5
years. To my surprise I had forgotten a few transformations while
recalling a few which are "equally difficult". It took about 10 hours
to get back to the stage where I can solve it in about 3 minutes
except for the flip of two opposite edges. I recall that we discussed,
in this forum, a nice procedure for this move many years ago and I
wonder whether anyone recalls it.

Also, to what extent have others shared my experience of forgetting
moves?
