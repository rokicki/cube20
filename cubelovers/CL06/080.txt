I VISITED BY "KAY-BEE" toy store at the mall today.  


REPEAT:  For those of you who like 3-d assembly puzzles a set of 2 GEO-LOGIC
(TAURUS&CETUS) puzzles for $7 .   These puzzles are plastic, and were designed
by Stuart Coffin and manufactured by Skor-Mor (OUT OF BUSINESS).   The full
collection of these puzzzles is called the GEO-LOGIC series.  They are each made
of 6 identical pieces (different for each puzzle) that can be assemblied into an
interlocking self supporting solid.   These puzzles are hard to find.   So if
you may be interested don't delay - call up your KAY BEE now.

NEW FOR 1988
  GRIPPLE as seen on TV for $10.  This is a sequential movement puzzle more
similar to missing link then the cube.

  YOSHI'S (shortening of designers name) PUZZLE for $12 from Parker Bros.  This
is a re-release of a formerly unbranded item, circa 1982 called miraculous cube.
 It is composed of a loop of tetrahedrons taped together to form hinges.   Yoshi
designed/invented two puzzles like this. The other is called the Shisei Mystery
and it works like a Rubik's magic with depth.

  Mattel has a cube puzzle made up of magnetic cubies called "Magic Force" 
I think.  not at kay-bee.
 

The Future is Puzzling, 
but Cubing is Forever.
