Hi CUBE-LOVERS,

I am a "collector" of Rubik's cubes and other magic polyhedra.  As a
collector I am not only interested in the puzzles themselves but also
in the literature about them, the packaging of them and the
merchandise/events that traded on the popularity of the cube.    Below
is a crude taxonomy with  items I have identified.  I would appreciate
criticism of the taxonomy and additions to the specific items . 
 Also, if anybody has or knows where to obtain any items of this genre
please let me know.   Since I am not personally a collector of most
books, articles or solution algorithms about the cube (Bandelow, Helm,
Singmaster, et al are doing that) please do not provide citations
unless they are especially noteworthy.
