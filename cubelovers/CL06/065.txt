Subject: in search of...


I have been in search of anyplace in the USA where i can obtain a Skewb. 
So far, in about a year, no luck. Games of Berkeley keeps claiming that they
have an order in, but it never seems to get there.  Does anybody out there have
one that they would be willing to sell me?
