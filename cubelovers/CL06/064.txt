Subject:  Deluxe Magic

I picked up a "deluxe Rubik's Magic" at Games People Play the other day.
It is a twelve-square magic.  Has anyone solved this guy yet?  My wife
has been hacking on it some and and has managed to run it from the
starting state (2x6) to the target state (as in the normal Magic, but
moreso), but not enough comprehension of it all yet to get all the
circle pieces in the right places, yet.

It seems to be more fun that the normal magic because if you ignore
the circles you can make a bunch of interesting shapes (the big-hollow-
square was neat to blunder into).

ps, a while back someone (pete?) posted a pointer to some magazine (foreign,
maybe?) that had an article about folding a Magic into a cube.  I don't
remember if I've asked this before or not, but... can anyone send me hints
about how the fold-magic-into-a-cube goes?  tnx /b\
