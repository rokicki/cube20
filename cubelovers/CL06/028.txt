I'm looking for information about the books _Beyond Language_ and
_Language on Vacation_ by Dmitri Borgmann.  I can't find them in any
of the various Books in Print, so they're either no longer in print,
or from a small publisher.  In any event, I would appreciate it if
someone could send me the following information:

  1. The correct spelling of the titles and the author's name (if I
     don't have them correct above).

  2. The publisher, and the publisher's address if it's available in
     either of the books.

  3. The ISBN.

Thanx for any information anyone can provide!
