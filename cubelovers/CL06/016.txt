RE:  SEARCH FOR CUBES

1.  The large chains are slowly clearing out the surplus stocks of cubes.  The
best for a revenge is "THRIFT DRUG" probably around $5, also try KAYBEE.  If
this fails send me your address and I will send you one a competitive price.

2.  As I have previously posted I am also trying to buy up surplus cubes and
make them available to cube collectors.  If anybody would like a list send me
your name and address and I will mail it to you.  If you are looking for a
particular cube ask for it I will tell you where to get it.  I correspond with
Singmaster, Gillen, Helm, Bandelow, Hess, Cecil Smith, Wally Webster about
cubes.

3.  If anybody knows of a good source of cubes a wholesale prices I would
appreciate the reference.
