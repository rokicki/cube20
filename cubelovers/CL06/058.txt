The October '87 issue of 'Scientific American' is completely devoted to
Advanced Computing, so it is probably of interest to many of us.  In
addition, the 'Amateur Scientist' column in that issue (by Jearle
Walker, pages 170-173) is all about Rubik's Magic (the original, 8-panel
version).  It includes tables and diagrams of permutations, and a
complete solution with pictures.
