      Greetings fellow cube lovers,

         I have only learned to solve the cube this summer, and now am working
 on R*bik's Revenge (and Magic) and I was wondering if anyone out there knows
 of any publications dealing with solving them and any dealing with the theory
 behind them - as I have really enjoyed Frey & Singmaster's _Cubik Math_.

         I have tried writing to Ideal Toy Corporation as mention in the Revenge
 product but they seem to have moved - anybody know where they are?


          thanks in advance,

                  Rob
