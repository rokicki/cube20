1.  My crack puzzle team has added four squares to "MAGIC".  This puzzle has
much more variability in making planar patterns (I count doubled up squares) ,
while retaining the same flavor as the original puzzle.  Some examples:

     XXXXXX            XXXX              XXXX                     XXXX
     XXXXXX            XXXX              X    X                     XXXX
                            XXXX             X    X                     XX
                                                XXXX                     XX

Has anybody else changed the number of squares?  

2.  Has anybody speculated on Rubik's next puzzle based on this hinge mechanism?
 My puzzle team thinks a equilateral triangles instead of squares has potential.
 Any comments?
