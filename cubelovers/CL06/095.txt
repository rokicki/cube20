Recently, I posted (twice -- sorry!) a short note from the 'Los Angeles Times'
about Rubik's Clock.  Another paper had just a little more information.  From
the 'Los Angeles Herald Examiner', July 26, 1988:


                      RUBIK'S PUZZLING NEW TWIST
		      
    Father of cube craze offers clock toy for those with time on their hands
    
    
    LONDON (AP) - The Hungarian professor [pictured] who frustrated 
    millions with his Rubik's Cube is introducing his latest mind-twister 
    -- a puzzle he says even he hasn't solved, a spokeswoman for the toy 
    company marketing the product said yesterday.
    
    But Erno Rubik's failure has not arisen from a lack of ability, 
    merely a lack of time to puzzle out the secrets of Rubik's Clock, 
    said Melanie Bateman of Matchbox Toys Ltd.  "Really, it's not because 
    it's impossible, he's just too busy to take the time to do it," she said, 
    adding that the new toy will be launched at a major London toy store on
    Saturday.
    
    Rubik's latest brain-teasing toy requires a player to get 18 clocks 
    on both sides of a plastic disc to strike midnight simultaneously by 
    twisting wheels that turn some of the hands but not others, said Bateman.
    
    Speaking of his latest invention, Rubik warned in a press release:  
    "Don't cheat by being taught how to do it by someone else.  It is 
    much more satisfying to decode the puzzle on your own."
    
    "It is important to remember that your brain needs to be kept in shape 
    ... My new puzzle can help because it enables you to focus entirely on 
    finding the formula which, although it may seem frustrating at the time, 
    will do you good," he added.
    
    Rubik's Clock will retain for about $12, Bateman said.
    
    Rubik, 44, a professor of architecture and design at the Academy of Arts 
    and Crafts in Budapest, invented the multicolored Rubik's Cube as a 
    teaching aid.
    
    After the success of the cube, which sold more than 120 million units 
    worldwide, he founded a private business, Rubik's Studio, in conjunction 
    with the Hungarian government.
