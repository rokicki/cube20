FROM THE PREFACE:   
_______________________________
ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK
------------------------------------
The book falls naturally into two parts.  The first, up to and including Chapter
7, can be used as the text for a geometry course at the undergraduate level -
...   The first few sections of chapter 1 are fundamental, however, chapter 2
deals mostly with tilings in which the tiles are regular polygons.  ...   The
general theory of tilings is presented in chapters 3 and 4, these chapters are
rather more technical than the rest of the book, and ...    In chapter 5 we
begin our discussion of the theory of patterns; this continues in chapter 7. 
...

the second part (chapters 8-12) presents detailed surveys of various aspects of
the subjects of patterns and tilings.  These include colored patterns and groups
of color symmetry, tilings by polygons, tilings in which the tiles are unusual
in a topological sense, as well as, a detailed and self-contained account of the
intriguing topic of aperiodic tilings.  ...
