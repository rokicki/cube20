HI CUBE-LOVERS, 

PUZZLE AVAILABILITY:

6/17 MACY'S RAN AN AD IN THE NY TIMES FOR 12 PIECE RUBIK'S MAGIC.  The puzzle
has 5 rings that have to be linked and was advertised for $15.

In Japan, associated with the New Zealand mazes are puzzle shops.  These shops
are creating a demand for puzzles.  A co-worker just back from Tokyo purchased
some puzzles at the "MATSUYA" department store in GINZA.  There is a line of
cast puzzles that cost about $7:  KEY, A-B-C, STAR, S&S, HORSESHOES (see slocums
book).  There is also a line of Ring disentanglement puzzles that cost about $6;
 BROKEN HEART, SWING, "U" RING, DEVIL, POT, LOOP, TRIO RING.  Both puzzle lines
are Bronze colored and come nicely gift boxed.

The Future is Puzzling and Cubing is Forever,

Pete beck                  <BECK@ARDEC-LCSS>
