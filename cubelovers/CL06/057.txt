1.  For the collectors, I recently obtained a new to me shape variant of the
2x2x2.  It is a cylinder, mine is half black and half white.  It was made by the
Swiss company NAEF and is called "ROTA".  It is very similar in size to the
standard cube.  It should cost about $15.

2.  Has anybody played a game called "GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES".  It uses the
PYRAMINX in some fashion and I believe it was developed/marketed by MEFFERT.

Thanks in advance.
