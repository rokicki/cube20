THIS MAYBE A DUPLICATE - I AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY MAILER

HI CUBE-LOVERS, 

I understand that the "Puzzle Exhibition" tour has been changed and that it
won't be coming to MIT until the fall.  Does anybody have more information.  

One of my co-workers advised me that she saw a puzzle called "Rubik's SQUARE",
not magic, in the San Jose airport gift shop.  Does anybody know what this is
and where it can be obtained or even a picture seen.

I have been working on alternate designs for the 8 square magic with some
success.  If anybody out there is also doing the same I would like to talk, swap
designs, etc.   If anybody has suggestions for alternate designs I would
appreciate receiving them.

The Future is Puzzling and Cubing is Forever,

Pete beck                  <BECK@ARDEC-LCSS>
