BOOKS:  Singmaster is editing a series of books for Oxford University Press on
Recrreational Mathematics and is requesting input on the following:
1) " I (Singmaster) have embarked on a project to find the sources of classical
problems in recreational mathematics.  .....
    The initial object of this project was to produce a book of sources,
translated into english with annotation, for .... However, it now appears that
the first stage must be the prpearation of an annotated bibliography of the
material.  ...  draft of paper which outlines the project and some of the
material is available.  I would be delighted to hear from anyone interested in
this project, particularly anyone able to provide info."
2)  "I am also compiling a list of mathematical monuments and have a draft
article on this."
