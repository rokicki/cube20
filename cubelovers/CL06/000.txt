Those of you who look through the archives of old Cube-Lovers mail will
notice that I have split off a new section of the archive.  The mail now
lives on MIT-AI in the files:

AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL0	;oldest mail in forward order
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL1	;next oldest mail in forward order
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL2	;more of same
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL3	;still more of same
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL4	;yet more
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL5	;more still
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL	;recent mail in reverse order

As always files can be FTP'd from MIT-AI without an account.  (And yes, the
spaces in those filenames are a significant part of our filename syntax.)

While I have everyone's attention let me remind you all that last year
Cube-Lovers moved from its original home on MIT-MC to MIT-AI.  Our new
addresses are Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for submissions and
Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.

If you have occasion to send mail to Cube-Lovers, you will generally find
that a fair number of copies of your message will be returned to you by
various mailers around the world for various reasons.  This is always a
problem with old, and fairly quiet mailing lists.  If you would like to be
helpful, you can collect these errors and forward them to
Cube-Lovers-Request (I will eventually flush anyone who is consistently
unreachable), but under no condition should you forward the error message
to Cube-Lovers itself.  Thank you.
