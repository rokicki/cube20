FOR FUN, JAPAN TURNS TO MAZES

The Sunday NY TImes of 10/11/87 Travel section, pg3 had a small piece on
amusement park mazes.

Some random quotes:

"A lot of people are willing to pay the $3 fee that most of the approximately 20
outdoor mazes charge for the opportunity to become confused."

"The object, ...,  is to get through the maze as fasy as possible.  On average,
it takes 45 minutes to escape or give up."

"each maze has a theme - such as the Paris-Dakar Rally Maze in Tokyo and the
Sherlock Maze in Osaka."
