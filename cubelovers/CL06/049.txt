The traveling puzzle show, "PUZZLES OLD AND NEW" is reviewed in the
Sunday, July 26 New York Times' Arts & Leisure section, page 31.  It has
opened at the Hudson River Museum.

Also of possible interest:  In the same section, page 33, is a review of
the exhibit "SAFE AND SECURE: KEYS AND LOCKS", which is at the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
