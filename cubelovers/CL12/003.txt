Correct, but I think you know what I mean: minimum >= 1

More than a week

I am sorry, but I have to disagree on this. It is not that simple.

If you managed to place 99 pieces, you have already placed three or even
all four of the duplicated pieces (depending on which one is left over)
If you placed three, there are tree possibilities for the piece we need:
- it is nonexistent (illegal colour combinations): no solution
- it is one of the duplicated pieces: this means two of the four puzzles
  will be identical which is OK, but not so nice, or
- it is any other piece: we found a good solution

If you placed all four duplicated pieces already, any solution you find
will not satisfy the conditions of the puzzle (i.e. precisely four duplicated
pieces).

And in both cases you have not solved:
   which four pieces to duplicate in order to find solutions for the 10x10.
but:
   which four pieces to duplicate in order to find solutions for the 10x10,
   with the restriction that three of them must be identical to any three
   taken from the set of four duplicates given by Rubik.

Solving the puzzle without this restriction requires a different approach.
I was thinking of starting the program with 5 of each (120 pieces), and after
placing the 5th duplicated piece remove the rest of the duplicates from
the remaining pieces, and see if this leads to a solution. As soon as back-
tracking removes the 5th duplicate, all other duplicates must be made
accessible again.
