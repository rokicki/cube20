Mr Jerry Slocum
  I just got your Directory, great job!

  The last order seems mixed up.  I ordered:
     Jug w/ <>'s
     1989 Puzzle Calendar
  I only received Jug w/ Diamonds.  (The directory was from    a previous
order).  I included $29 , I believe.

  Also , thanks for the info on        cube-lovers.
  If this is garbled its because my modem is not working so well.
