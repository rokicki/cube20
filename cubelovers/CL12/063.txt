ML's Conjecture: The < U, R > group is >=20 turns deep in qt metric

UR Reflective processes: (in the q metric)
A different sort of symmetry which I started to investigate, having
 been inspired by my friend who solves his cube 2 adjacent faces
 last!

These are the only UR reflective processes at 10 q turns:
     U3 R1 U1 R1 (U2) R3 U3 R3 U1 = R3 U1 R1 U1 (R2) U3 R3 U3 R1   (10)
     U1 R3 U3 R3 (U2) R1 U1 R1 U3 = R1 U3 R3 U3 (R2) U1 R1 U1 R3   (10)

Here is the obvious one we all know:
                    ( U2 R2 ) ^ 3 = ( R2 U2 ) ^ 3                  (12)

I liked this pattern in particular...
       U1 R1 U2 R3 U2 R3 U2 R1 U1 = R1 U1 R2 U3 R2 U3 R2 U1 R1     (12)

I hope to have an algorithm to plumb the depths of the < U, R > group
 soon. Amusingly my friend complained about not been able solve
 the cube completely as he was stuck in a position with 2 flipped
 edges. After watching him squirm for a few weeks I did tell him
 you can't flip edges in the < U, R > group!     ;->

Congrats to Dan Hoey, Dik Winter, Jerry Bryan and Ludwig Plutonium
 for making it into the 1994 Internet White Pages! I'm in good
 company.

P.S. I just read the last J.B. post and see I've been somewhat
     overshadowed. Ok let's see some antipodes! At least our
     results are the same though. So, ummmm I guess ML's
     conjecture is correct!
