ISHI PRESS MAILING LIST!

Earlier, I have intruded on this fine discussion to solicit e-mail addresses
for Ishi Press's retail puzzle e-mail list.  Due to some unforseen hardware
problems, however, we were cut off from the net for a couple weeks, and
have lost all of our e-mail lists.

If you would like to receive e-mailings of Ishi Press's impressive line
of mechanical puzzles, send us your e-mail address.  If you would like
a full color catalog, including puzzle reference guide, send us your
postal address as well.

PLEASE INDICATE THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PUZZLES AND/OR GO (an ancient
oriental strategy game).

Retail E-mailings are sent about once per month, so we won't be stuffing
your e-mail box with more junk to slog through.  While some e-mailings
duplicate our paper sales literature, there are often descriptions, reviews,
and offers that we would never include in a general mailing (such as damaged
or second merchandise, unique items, out of print books).

Always feel free to write me if you have any questions or comments.
