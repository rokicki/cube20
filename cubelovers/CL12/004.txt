Subject: Anyone solved Rubik's Tangle?

For those who haven't seen it, Rubik's Tangle is a new puzzle to 
drive us all nuts, break up our families, and divert us from
the things we should be working on.

It consists of 25 tiles, which form a 5x5 pattern. On each
tile is a pattern of coloured ropes, the ends of which must
match the ends of the ropes on the adjacent tiles.

Certain clues are evident: the shape of each rope pattern
is the same, there are equal numbers of each colour,
and each tile given a letter label on the back.

Before I waste my life on this, has anyone solved the
problem?

Peter
