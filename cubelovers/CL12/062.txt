Ok, here it is.  This search is narrower and deeper than any
I have ever done before.  Frey and Singmaster give <U,R>
a good bit of attention in their book, pointing out that it
is trickier than it might first appear.

It is called the Two-Generator Group.  The size of the group
can be calculated as (7!5!/2)(3^6/3) = 73,483,200.  The
3^6 factor accounts for twisting the corners, but there is no
2^n factor as the edges cannot be flipped.

These results are in terms of Q turns without any conjugate
class checking.  I would regard the following as open problems:
local maxima, results with Q+H turns, and results in terms of
conjugate classes.  In this particular case, it would not be
M-conjugates.  I would have to look at Dan Hoey's 98 subgroups
of M to see which subgroup applies to <U,R>.

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
