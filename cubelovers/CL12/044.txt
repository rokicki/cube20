Subject:   God's Algorithm, Additional Level

The following is for Q-turns only, whole cubes (both corners and
edges), and not considering M-conjugates.  I think it would be
possible to squeeze out another couple of levels by considering
M-conjugates.  The best previous result I have found in the
archives was through level 7 (reported on 7 December 1981, and again
on 3 August 1992).

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
