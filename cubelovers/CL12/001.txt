        ^^^^^^^
The kind Mr. Rubik has already done that - the minimum is - ZERO!

The revised problem can be solved fairly easily using your program ( I
don't know, though, how long it takes to run to completion for the 10*10
case) - try to place only 99 tiles  out of the 100 given tiles. You may
have several sub-solutions. It is then easy to determine for each of these
sub-solutions which tile you need to complete the 10*10 mosaic. If this
pattern has already been duplicated, i.e. you need THREE numbers of this
tile to find the complete solution, this sub-solution will not work and so
examine the next sub-solution .... Hopefully you find the solution this way.

After running the program for the 99 tiles, the additional time required
to solve the problem defined by you should not be significant because that
would be  a linear process.

Anand.
