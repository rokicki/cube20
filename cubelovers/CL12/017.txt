In the archive of this mailing list I found the following:
>CFF is a newsletter published by the Nederlandse Kubus Club NKC (Dutch
>Cubists Club).  It appears a bit irregular, but a few times a year.
>Yearly membership fee is now NLG 25.- (Dutch Guilders) which amounts to
>approximately $ 15.-.  Institutional membership is also possible.
>Information is available from the editor Gerald Maurice

Unfortunaty, the abovementioned editor didn't respond to my email.
Does anyone know whether CFF still exists? Who is the current editor?

                                                        Thanks,
                                                        Izak van Langevelde
