  A little hack tells me you can solve that by moving
  1,7,3,6,1,9,4,1,7,5,9,4,2,9,4,7,5,9,2,5,8.  That's 21 moves, or 30 if
  you count by the tile.  It's optimal in both metrics.

  Do you know anything about Rubik's Cube?

I was surprised to recieve solutions both so quickly.
Cubes-Lover is very smart team,　I think.

Thanks again,
