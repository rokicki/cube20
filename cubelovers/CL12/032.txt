Subject: xrubik


Hi
  I just finished up "xrubik", a UNIX-X Rubik's cube.  It has been tested
on Linux, SunOS, and HP-UX.  It currently resides on ftp.x.org at
/contrib/games/puzzles.  Here's the blurb from the README in that 
directory:
-------------------------------------------------------------
xrubik has been converted from xmrubik.
  New features:
        hold down control key to move whole cube
        letters that represent colors can now be changed in mono-mode
  Bug fix:
        when xmrubik did not recognize when the cube was solved nontrivially
        (i.e. the number of cubes on an edge > 1  OOPS.)
 
The /R5contrib/xmpuzzles:
xmpyramid       xmoct           xmskewb
xmcubes         xmtriangles     xmhexagons
are currently being changed to exclude Motif dependencies.
The Motif versions will no longer be maintained.
 
The proposed collection includes:
SLIDING BLOCK PUZZLES
xcubes:         expanded 15 puzzle
xtriangles:     same complexity as 15 puzzle
xhexagons:      2 modes: one ridiculously easy, one harder than 15 puzzle
 
ROTATIONAL 3D PUZZLES
xrubik:         a nxnxn rubik's cube
xpyramid:       a nxnxn tetrahedron (a nxnxn pyraminx)
                with Period 2, Period 3, and Combined cut modes
xoct:           a nxnxn octahedron with Period 3, Period 4, and Combined cut
                modes
xskewb:         a cube with diagonal cuts
The rest of the platonic solids (the dodecahedron and the icosahedron) seem
too hard for me.
 
These programs do not have self-solvers like "magiccube" (Motif) or
"puzzle" (X).
-----------------------------
Have fun
David (the newbie)
