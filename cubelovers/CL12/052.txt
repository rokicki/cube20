Fellow Cubers:

Does anyone know if the original 3x3 Rubik's Cube is still available?  My 
cube finally fell apart without any hope of repairing....  I still have 
my 'Revenge (which is also not too far from its last days) but I would 
still like to be able to play with the original... and keep my fingers 
nimble....  If the original cube is still available could you please post 
an address or something so that I can try to acquire one....

thanks,
                                                         ,,,
