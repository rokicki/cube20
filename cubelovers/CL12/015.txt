Hi, I was wondering if you can add me to your mailing list. 
  
  I put some motif puzzles at ftp.x.org in /contrib/motif_puzzles.
  They are: 
rubik: a (nxnxn) rubik's cube 
pyramid: a (nxnxn) pyraminx with period 2 and period 3 cuts 
oct: an (nxnxn) octahedron with period 3 and period 4 cuts  
skewb: a diagonal cut rubik's cube 
cubes, triangles, & hexagons: sliding block puzzles 
  There are no self-solvers provided with these. A record keeps track of
how many move it takes you to solve them. A record of 32767 means I never
did it. (I do not follow any standard notation for a move (for example,
on the rubik's cube a move is any 1/4 turn)).
  Unfortuately the motif puzzles need motif to compile.  Is there a good
public domain substitute for Motif?
 
Also you may want to check out the tetris games which only use X. 
altetris: polyomino version of tetris 
alweltris: polyomino version of welltris 
altertris: polyiamond version of tetris (they bounce off the walls) 
alhextris: polyhexes version of tetris (again, they bounce off the walls) 
These are found in ftp.x.org in /contrib 
  
I recently heard that 10x10 tangle has no solution.  I was trying to solve 
that one too.  What a waste! (90 days of compute time, wow thats one 
efficient program, fast machine , or both!)                 
 
Have fun
David
