   (continuation)

I have described this data base structure once before (a little
less formally before), but I wanted to describe it again because
there is some interesting (to me, at least) analysis that can be
derived from the data base, over and above God's algorithm.

First, it is interesting to compare |{m'Xmc}| to the various |Yc[i]|.
Recall that |Yc[i]| >= |{m'Xmc}| for all i in 1..24.  Also, by the
definition of |{m'Xmc}|, there is at least one i in 1..24 such that
|Yc[i]| = |{m'Xmc}|.

I posted a comparison of |{m'Xmc}| to |Yc[i]| for corners-only cubes
on 4 December 1993.  (I have the "without centers" part of the edges-only
data base done, but it will take many more months to
complete the "with centers" part.  So corners-only is the only
complete data base we have to work with.)

At the time, I received a couple of comments to the effect
that people didn't understand what I was comparing to what.  I hope
this note clarifies the situation.  For example (and referring to my
previous note with respect to corners-only cubes), there is only one
element of the form {m'Xmc} for which |{m'Xmc}| = 0.  The only element
for which the length is 0 is Start, but in a corners only cube without
centers, any rotation of Start is still at Start and still has length 0.

Here is a brief excerpt from my note of 4 December 1993.

              Corresponding Distances from Start
                     Using Only q-turns

        Without           With
        Centers         Centers         Number
     Distance from    Distance from    of Nodes
         Start         Start

           0
                           0                1
                           2                1
                           4                2
                           6                1

What this means is as follows.  First, we have |{m'Imc}| = 0.  Let
Y=Repr({m'Imc}).  Then, there is 1 element of the form Yc for which
|Yc|=0, 1 element of the form Yc for which |Yc|=2, 2 elements of the
form Yc for which |Yc|=4, and 1 element of the form Yc for which
|Yc|=6.

In words, suppose you have a corners-only cube (peel off the edge
tabs, but keep the corners and centers).  Then, suppose the
corners look "solved" if you ignore the centers.  The corners will
be rotated relative to the centers.  In all, there are 24 different
ways they can be rotated, including the identity, where they
are not rotated.

But under M-conjugancy, some of the 24 rotations are equivalent.
Under M-conjugancy, there is one way they can be 0 moves from Start,
one way they can be two moves from Start (RL' is equivalent to DU',
for example ), two ways they can be four moves from Start, and one way
they can be six moves from Start.  Among other things, this says that any
rotation of the corners (ignoring the edges) can be accomplished
in no more than six quarter turns.

This example illustrates why a set of the form {m'Xmc} may be
partitioned into "up to" twenty-four elements of the form
{m'Xm}, rather than "exactly" twenty-four elements.  Normally,
a set of the form  {m'Xmc} contains 1152 elements,
where 1152=24*48.  It can in turn be partitioned into twenty-four
elements of the form {m'Xm} which contain forty-eight elements each.
But cubes which are "symmetric" reduce the number because
various M-conjugates are equivalent.

I normally think of the God's algorithm data base as a matrix, with
the rows indexed by the representative elements Y, and the columns
indexed by C (or more simply, by 1..24).  Because of M-conjugate
symmetry, there are always a few empty cells in the matrix.

M-conjugate symmetry did not cause me any computational difficulty
when I was working with cubes without centers.  That is,
suppose {m'(X1)mc} and {m'(X2)mc} are the same set for X1 not equal
X2.  My "representative element calculator" would calculate the
same representative element Y in both cases.  But in the case of
cubes with centers, the "representative element calculator" had to
calculate both a representative element Y and an associated rotation
index Cind in 1..24.

When a set {m'Xmc} had exactly 1152 elements (most of the time), the
calculation of Cind was correct.  But when a set {m'Xmc} had fewer
than 1152 elements, I would get a different Cind depending on which
element of the set I started with.  That is, the loops in the program
actually calculate 1152 elements in any case, but if the set really has
less than 1152 elements, then some of the elements are generated
multiple times.  (The loops have no way of knowing ahead of time how
many elements are going to be in the set.)  The generation of the same
set elements multiple times severely messed up the calculation of Cind
until I figured out what was going on.

I want to finish by getting back to what I started with, the lengths
of cubes.  As I said, the God's algorithm results for edges without
centers are complete (posted to the list back in December), but the
God's algorithm calculations for edges with centers are still work
in progress.  However, I noticed something striking about the
partial edges with centers results when I compared them with the
completed edges without centers results.  For example, here is a
table which compares the results when using q-turns only.

As you can see, with or without centers, there are the same number
of cubes (actually, equivalence classes) at each distance from
Start from level 0 through level 4.  From level 5 on, there are more
cubes with centers than without.  Why is the number the same
through level 4, and what happens at level 5 to make the numbers
different?  Actually, overall there are about twenty-four times more
cubes with centers than without, so it is not surprising to find
more cubes with centers than without at fairly low levels in the
search tree.  So fundamentally, the question is, why does the
divergence occur at level 5?

Well, I can't explain why it is level 5 exactly, but I can explain
what is going on.  Consider level 0.  There is one row in the data
base where |{m'Xmc}|=0.  There are twenty-four cells in the same row
for |Yc[i]|, corresponding to the twenty-four rotations of the
representative element Y.  For exactly one of these cells, we have
|Yc[i]|=0.  The remainder of the cells are either undefined (meaning
the cell represents a rotation which is M-conjugate equivalent with
another rotation), or else we have |Yc[i]|>=5.  Hence, any
rotation of the edges of the cube requires at least 5 q-turns to
accomplish.  After the data base is complete, we can determine
exactly how many q-turns are required to accomplish each rotation of
the edges, just as we can already do with the corners.

Similar comments apply to level 1 through 4.  There is exactly one
rotation of the representative element that has the same length as
representative element.  All the other rotations of the representative
element are either M-conjugate equivalent to the representative
element, or else have a length greater than or equal to 5.
