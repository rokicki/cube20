Subject:   Re: < U, R > revisited (with Local Maxima)
In-Reply-To: Message of 09/01/94 at 22:56:00 from mark.longridge@canrem.com

I performed a Local Maxima analysis.  (This is for Q-turns only.)  The Local
Maxima are in column 4.  The shortest local maxima (six of them) are of
length 12.  Interestingly, this is the same length which is suspected of
being the shortest Q-turn length for a local maximum in the full cube group.
Is there any connection?  Also, the global maxima are of length 25.  Does
this tell us anything about the Q-turn length of the global maxima for the
full cube group?  Finally, pick any cube X in <U,R>.  We know
|X| in G <= |X| in <U,R>.  Can anybody find a cube X such that
|X| in G < |X| in <U,R>?  Alternatively, can anybody prove
|X| in G = |X| in <U,R> for all X in <U,R>?  (This assumes Q-turns only in
all cases.  The questions would all have to be asked again for Q+H-turns.)

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
