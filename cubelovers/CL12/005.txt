Yes, it's been solved, and discussed at some length on this group.
However, I haven't seen anyone who claims to have come up with an
"insightful" solution, i.e. one in which you figure out a general
approach that leads to a solution.  All solutions I've heard of
have been found by exhaustive search, often by computer.
