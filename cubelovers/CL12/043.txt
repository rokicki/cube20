Subject: A real robot solve the Rubik's Cube but...

A real robot which had artificial eyes and arms and computer brain was 
manufactured at Kawasaki Heavy Industry Co.,Ltd in Japan last year. 
He can solve the real commercial Rubik's Cube.

As he has not so intelligent, it takes about 12 minutes and 120 steps
average between starting and finishing the Cube to solve it.

Are there any other live robot like him over the world?  Do you know?

And you can help him more clever with your solving algolithm, can't you?
