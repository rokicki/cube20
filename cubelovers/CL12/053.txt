Well I decided to pull a "Jerry Byran" and take another look at
 some cube results, plus take a look at some new groups.

 program starts to really bog down after this...

  I leave it to Jerry or Dan to check my results. I checked up to 2
moves deep by hand and verified 10 different positions. What I don't
understand is how Jerry manages to look at so many cube positions:

On full 3x3x3 cube,   7     100,803,036     13.231  (new)

  Using 10 bytes to store a single cube position would still
need over 1 billion bytes, or am I missing something?

  I also used GAP (quite a good program) to calculate the size of
  < U1, R1 > on the magic dodecahedron: 7,999,675,084,800.

  Once again, I welcome any verification.
