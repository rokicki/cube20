	   I would like to be taken off the mailing list.

Despite the fact that you stupidly mailed your administrative request to
the entire mailing list, I have removed you from Cube-Lovers.

I thought I would also take this opportunity to remind the rest of you of
the contents of the greeting message I send all new subscribers.
Old-timers who've seen previous versions of this file can amuse themselves
by noticing that this winter we had some of our heaviest traffic ever.

------- Begin Standard Greeting -------

Don't expect to receive any mail anytime soon.  Cube-Lovers is mostly quiet
these days.  Our addresses are Cube-Lovers@AI.MIT.EDU for submissions and
Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.

Please note that Cube-Lovers-Request is processed by a human being, not a
computer program (such as LISTSERV or Majordomo).  If your request is not
instantly processed, it is because I don't spend my entire life reading my
electronic mail.  I do know how to interpret many of the commands typically
sent to such programs, but I would prefer it if instead you can remember to
address me in complete sentences.

If you are interested in the archives of the Cube-Lovers mailing list:

Using FTP, connect to FTP.AI.MIT.EDU, login as "anonymous" (any password),
and in the directory "pub/cube-lovers" you will find the twelve (compressed)
files "cube-mail-0.gz" through "cube-mail-11.gz".

Archive vital statistics (when uncompressed):

	cube-mail-10	20 Mar 93	 6 Dec 93	171881
	cube-mail-11	 6 Dec 93	18 Feb 94	349772

In addition, the file "recent-mail" contains a copy of the currently active
section of the archive.  (Unfortunately, due to the way mail works here at
the AI Lab, it is not possible to have new mail accumulate directly into
this file, so there may be some delay before a new message arrives here.)
Finally, the file "README" contains the information you are currently reading.
