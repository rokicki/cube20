Subject:   Branching Factors and God's Algorithm Search Trees

At various times, there have been discussions about what the maximum
distance from Start might be in God's algorithm.  One argument is made
with respect to worst/best case branching factors.  For example,
a simple calculation is that the first move has at most twelve
possibilities and that each subsequent move has eleven possibilities,
when dealing with Q-turns only.  For Q-turns plus H-turns, the same
argument would be eighteen possibilities for the first move and seventeen
possibilities for each subsequent move.

My experience is that search trees tend to develop relatively
constant branching factors after some sort of variable startup.
I expect Rubik's cube to be no different.  I just wonder if anyone
has calculated some number of levels for the full Rubik's cube,
enough levels for the hypothesized steady state branching factor
to be achieved.  I have not done so, but if anyone has, it might
shed considerable light on the question of the maximum distance
from Start.

Subsets of the cube such as corners only and edges only have been
calculated.  It is suggestive to examine branching factors for the
cases which have already been calculated.  The question of "average
branching factor" is subject to interpretation because it is not
necessarily clear when the distribution has achieved its steady
state.  I am including a number of tables giving branching factors
for the cases which have been calculated already.  I will preface
the tables with the following comments:

   1. The distributions for edges-only cubes have a variable branching
      factor during a startup phase, then have a relatively constant
      branching factor for several levels. and finally the distribution
      has sort of a tail.

   2. The distributions for corners-only cubes have a variable branching
      factor during a startup phase, and almost immediately the
      distribution has a tail.  The number of cases simply is not
      large enough to support an extended constant branching factor
      in the middle of the distribution.  It's sort of like a very
      short airplane flight where it is time to descend about the
      time the ascent is completed.

   3. I would expect the distributions for a full cube to have an
      even longer period with a constant branching factor than
      the distributions for edges-only cubes because the number
      of cases is so much larger.  There should be plenty of time
      for a plateau between the startup phase and any tail of the
      distribution.

   4. There are an equal number of odd and even permutations.  For
      the cases where you restrict yourself to Q-turns, there are
      therefore equal numbers of states an even distance from Start
      and an odd distance from Start.  Hence, the distribution tends
      either to have two adjacent levels with approximately equal
      numbers of states, or else tends to have one dominant level with
      a level on each side of the dominant level with about half
      the number of states in the dominant level.

   5. For the cases where you allow both Q-turns and H-turns, there
      tends to be one dominant level which contains most of the
      of the states.

   6. Those of you who followed all the traffic on this list in
      December and January will recall that my work with God's
      algorithm exploits symmetric conjugates in order to reduce
      the size of the problem.  It turns out that using conjugates
      does not change the average branching factor once you get
      past the startup portion of the distribution.  This effect
      can be a bit hard to see for corners-only cubes because the
      steady state portion of the distribution is so short, but
      the effect is very striking for edges-only cubes.  I would
      expect the effect to be very striking, as well, for the
      case of the full cube.
