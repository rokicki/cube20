Subject:   Analysis of Turns Towards Start for Whole Cube

The following chart for level 0 through level 8 of the whole
cube using Q-turns gives the number of Q-turns for each cube which will
move towards Start.  (I recently gave the same analysis for corners only.)

Columns 9 through 12 are omitted from the chart since they contain
all zeros.  Any local maxima would appear in column 12.

This adds one new level known not to contain any local maxima.  It would
be extremely interesting to be able to extend the chart at least to
level 12 because level 12 is known to include a local maximum.

As with the corners-only case, the chart contains almost all even numbers.
However, unlike the corners-only case, the numbers do not cluster in
the even columns.  Rather, they cluster towards column 1.  This means that
(close to Start, at least) most cubes have only one "good" move that
takes you closer to Start.  It also serves to illustrate why "random"
moves so quickly scramble the cube.

                           Number of Q-turns which Move

If you don't have time to do it right today, what makes you think you are
going to have time to do it over again tomorrow?
