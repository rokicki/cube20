(I sent my request to be added to this mailing list in to
 cube-lovers-request@ai.ai.mit.edu a few days ago and havnt
 heard back. Hope this works..)

I was going thru my stuff a while back and found my two original
Rubik's Cubes, one of which was given to me several years before
they became wildly popular. The solution I learned was in the
book "The Simple Solution To Rubik's Cube", which was a paperback
of about 20-30 pages.

I remember most of the solution steps outlined in the book, (my
hands remember better than my head does), however, I can't find
a copy of the book anywhere, to refresh my memory.

Anyone got a copy or know where I can get one?
