Subject: Corrected calculations are now done.

After an initial false start I have now calculated the path-lengths in
phase 1 of Kociemba's algorithm.  The figures are as follows:
path	configurations
  0:          1
  1:          4
  2:         50
  3:        592
  4:       7156
  5:      87236
  6:    1043817
  7:   12070278
  8:  124946368
  9:  821605960
 10: 1199128738
 11:   58202444
 12:        476
The figure 50 for path length 2 is easily verified by hand.  I have a list
with information about the configurations requiring a path-length of 12
(actually the paths leading to such a configurations).  As should be true
for each minimal path in phase 1, all paths start and terminate with a
quarter turn of F, R, B or L.

Some details.

Phase 1 of the algorithm brings the cube in the subgroup generated by
[F^2, R^2, B^2, L^2, U, D].  There are in this case 2,217,093,120
(2048 * 2187 * 495) cosets.  This can be (and has been) reduced largely
by observing symmetries.  In this case rotating the complete cube
along the UD axis by a quarter turn, rotating the cube along the RL
axis by a half turn and mirroring through the FRBL plane reveal
equivalent cosets.  Although it is possible to remove *all* cosets that
are equivalent to some canonical coset this was not done.  The removal
has only been done for the twists of corner cubes, reducing the factor
2187 to 168, and reducing the number of configurations to be handled to
170,311,680.  For each configuration a minimal path was calculated.
This was done starting with an absolute minimum found through the coordinate
axis and through the 2-dimensional coordinate spaces.  When a path of that
length was not found the path length was increased and a new attempt was made.
This was done until a path was found.  All searches were exhaustive.  On
average paths were searched for 3 different lengths (519,177,716 attempts
for 170,311,679 configurations).

The computations were done on a farm of workstations where each workstation
got a portion of the flip dimension (2048 cases of 83,160 configurations).
Computation time for one portion was from 1 to 2 hours (1.5 on average), so
the total computation was about 3000 hours.  On a system with enough
memory (50 MByte) it would have taken only 1 hour (this based on experiments
with the corner cubes-only part).  It could also have been with a single
processor and a 50 MByte file, in that case CP time would also be about 1
hour, but the I/O time would exceed the 3000 hours very much.

Using this result and the result by Hans Kloosterman the diameter of the
cube group is at most 37.  I conjecture the maximal path length in phase 2
of Kociemba's algorithm is 16, although the requirements on computer time
cq. memory do inhibit calculations at this moment (only in memory would be
feasible, but that requires 500 to 1000 MByte and computation time would be
about one day).  This figure of 16 would reduce the upperbound of the groups
diameter to 28.

Unfortunately Dik's conjecture for phase 2 is too optimistic.
Recall the maximum distances of the 4 stages of my algorithm:
 1.  7 moves within the group <R, L, F, B, U,D>
 2. 10 moves within the group <R, L, F2,B2,U,D>
 3.  8 moves within the group <R2,L2,F2,B2,U,D>
 4. 18 moves within the group <R2,L2,F2,B2,U,D>

(Stage 3 and 4 together requires at most 25 moves.)

These number of moves are minimal and cannot be improved within their
group of moves. (Stage 2 can also not be improved using all moves.)
From this we may conclude that the maximum path length in stage 2 of
the algorithm of Kociemba is at least 18 moves.

Taking the results of Dik Winter for stage 1 into account, the lower-bound
for the mximum of Kociemba's algorithm becomes 30 moves.

Did you (since your article) do an exhaustive search?  In your article you
mentioned that you had 6 positions that still do require 18 moves.  And you
mention that you doubted that there would be 17 move solvers.  Have you
proven since then that it can not be done in less than 18?  If not, send me
your positions and I will try.

I have currently a program running that tries all phase 4 positions.  It
is possible to reduce the number of searches from 3,981,312 (the article
contains a typo here) to 428,544 by observing equivalent positions (as
I did mention in a previous article (*)).  Assuming my conjecture of 16 the
complete calculations would take about 1000 to 1500 hours (%).  Not
unprecedented ;-).  (There must be a reason that I am a member of the CWI
research group on large scale computing.)  There are now only two machines
munching at the problem, but there would be no problem to start up a few more
again.  I just did it to see what happens.

* The equivalent positions are found by rotation of the complete cube along
the UD axis for a quarter turn, along the RL axis through a half turn and
mirroring along the FRBL plane.  When looking at one dimension only this
reduces the number from 40320 to 2768.  Restricting to Hans's initial positions
in phase 4, this reduces the number from 576 to 62.  So the count becomes:
	62 * 576 * 24 / 2
in stead of
	576 * 576 * 24 / 2 (= ((4!)^5) / 2).

% I found that an exhaustive search upto 16 moves takes about 10 seconds.
Increasing to 17 would up the time to 110 seconds.  So if you mail me
the situations for which you do not yet have less than 18 moves I will
have an attempt at them.

Subject: Re:  Lower-bound Kociemba's algorithm

As an afterthough, it would be interesting if it is possible to reduce the
number of moves in your fourth phase.  The main difference between your
algorithm and Kociemba's is that yours is deterministic.  Kociemba's
algorithm performs quite a number of searches before finding the optimal
solution.  And even than it is not known whether the solution is indeed
optimal, longer searches might reveal better solutions.  Your algorithm
gives an upper bound to the number of moves, and the solution is reached
in limited time.  Kociemba's algorithm is in theory unlimited in time.

My experience is that it is best to limit the first phase in Kociemba's
algorithm to 13 moves.  But that is only because of time constraints.

I have done an exhaustive search and none of the 6 situations of 18 moves
could be reduced to 17 moves (within the group of <R2,L2,F2,B2,U,D>).
For the case you want to verify, one of them is:

   L2 U R2 B2 U2 B2 L2 D2 L2 F2 D' L2 B2 F2 L2 F2 U' D

Of course I verified it ;-).  This one does indeed kill Kociemba's algorithm.
On a fast processor (65 MHz SPARC) with a larger limit database than Kociemba
is using himself (the database is about 5 MByte for the second phase), it took
3 hours 15 minutes to find a minimal solution.  Of 18 moves.

Subject: How big is the Magic Domino?

Having done a number of calculations on maximal distances I thought about
getting at newer pastures.  The Magic Domino.  The results follow in the
next mailing, this post discusses a bit about the information found there.
I added to the next mail also the previous results for the 2x2x2 and the
corners of the 3x3x3 together with some additional results not presented
previously.  There are for each puzzle five columns.  The first one
enumerates the number of moves, the next two give the results if both
quarter and half turns are accepted as moves, the last two give the
information if only quarter turns are accepted (of course, on the Domino
this distinction is there only for the U and D faces, the others know
half turns only).  For each case there are two columns, the first giving the
number of positions requiring the stated number of moves, the second
column gives the number of local maxima (i.e. each move brings you closer
to a solution).

There are three tables for the Domino.  The one you want to pick depends
on how you view the puzzle.  The first view is that there is only one
solution with on top 1 to 3 running from left back to right back.  The
second view is that rotation of the puzzle makes different configurations
indistinguishable, so the total number of configuration is (8!)^2 / 4.
An alternative way to look at it is that there are 4 solutions.  One the
standard solution, the others obtained by rotating the domino along the
UD axis.  The distinction between the two views is only a factor of four
in the number of configurations for the different path-lengths.  Finally,
we can view as a solution the configuration with on top 1 to 3 running from
right back to left back in stead of the other way around.  Actually this
solution is not worse than the other, because, if we turn over a solved
Domino we go from one to the other.  This view can also be expressed by saying
there are 8 solutions.  I give results for all three cases.  The numbers upto
(and including) path-length 2 have been checked by hand.

Some remarkable observations.

When we compare the tables for 1 solution and those for 4 solutions we see
that for short path-lengths the number of configurations is multiplied by
4.  On the other hand, for long path-lengths the number of configurations
is equal!  We can say that rotation of the Domino has only a short range
effect.

On the other hand, if we compare both with the 8-solutions tables we see that
the latter allows shorter solutions in general, so mirroring has a long
range effect.

Each of the 6 calculations on the Magic Domino took 2 to 2.5 hours on one
processor of an SGI 4D-420S.  The program is completely memory bound (and
the cache does not help).  It needs at least 31 MByte of core (and must be
resident) otherwise you will get no results at all in reasonable time.  I
tried it on the 32 MByte FPS; while it will happily give results initially
at some stage it will not longer run.  Not only that it will not walk either,
and also not crawl.  It is just sitting there paging in and paging out (a
phenomenon known as page thrashing).  I found that the program would get
less than 0.005 % of the CPU on an otherwise unloaded machine.

The program would enable me to write a 27901440 byte file that would assist
in an optimal solver for the Domino.

Subject: Magic Domino part3

Considering my previous fiasco, I have now incorporated the changes needed to
make the magic domino calculating program working into the program that
calculated the corners on a 3x3x3 cube.  The results still match, which
gives me confidence that the algorithms are correct indeed.  Moreover,
it reduced the time to do the 3x3x3 corner calculations to 8 minutes.

Pons Asinorum is Latin for "Asses' Bridge," and is the name of the
proposition that the base angles of an isoceles triangle are equal.
It is more generally any test of ability imposed upon the inexperienced
or ignorant.

As everyone is informed when they subscribe, administrative requests should
be directed to Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU (me).  Even if you lost my
original greeting message, the "-Request" suffix is a sufficiently
widespread convention for mailing lists that you should have tried it
first, before bothering the entire mailing list.

STEFANO@agrclu.st.it, I have removed you.

Kees.Goet@rcl.wau.nl, I will be sending you separate mail about your

   Pons Asinorum is Latin for "Asses' Bridge," and is the name of the
   proposition that the base angles of an isoceles triangle are equal.
   It is more generally any test of ability imposed upon the inexperienced
   or ignorant.

The term also carries the connotation that the test is in fact
of the simplest and most elementary kind.  If you can't prove
the Pons Asinorum of geometry, then you don't know even the most
elementary concept of geometry--i.e., as a geometer, you know as
much as a donkey.  And if you cannot form the Pons Asinorum
pattern, you sure don't know much about cubing.

       It is more generally any test of ability imposed upon the inexperienced
       or ignorant.

    The term also carries the connotation that the test is in fact
    of the simplest and most elementary kind.  If you can't prove
    the Pons Asinorum of geometry, then you don't know even the most
    elementary concept of geometry--i.e., as a geometer, you know as
    much as a donkey.  And if you cannot form the Pons Asinorum
    pattern, you sure don't know much about cubing.

    --Guy Steele

I think the metaphorical leap from geometry to cubing was probably made
by Bernie Greenberg, in whatever year it was that Hofstadter did his Sci
Am column.  Hofstadter came to MIT to talk to a bunch of cubers,
gathering material for his article.  I was in the group and my name is
mentioned in the article -- the only time I have ever gotten my name
into Sci Am.

"Pons Asinorum" has a lot of Bernie's style about it -- casual use of
Latin, whimsical metaphor, fondness for naming things.  He had a bunch
of cube operators with Latin names, and also some wacky English ones.  I
remember the Spratt Wrench (F R'L D R'L B R'L U R'L) which flips four
edges and was what everyone used before monoflips were discovered.
Bernie also had things with names like the Lesser Hammer of the Right
and the Greater Hammer of the Right; his "patter" was fabulous.  I
regret not having a videotape of Bernie solving the cube in, say, 1978.
(I hope I've got the year right.)

While I'm reminiscing, I should confess that my standard corner operator
is still the same as it was then: (FUR)^5, which exchanges two corners,
leaves the rest of the corners alone, and fucks the edges completely.
(Prudes, do not hassle me.  This has been a technical term in cubing
around MIT since The Beginning.)  Because of this property of "furry
five", I have to home and orient all the corners first, before I touch
the edges.  It's the kind of quirky algorithm you don't see among
younger cubers, because everybody these days learns how to solve the
thing from a book.  In the Beginning, there were no books, and I proudly
state that I solved the cube from scratch, by brainpower.  Later I
discovered that there were easier ways to do things than (FR)^105!  I
had pages and pages covered with little cube diagrams with arrows
showing how the stickers were permuted by a particular sequence.

I'm interested in hearing other reminiscences from people who actually
solved the cube -- you're disqualified if you learned how to solve it
from somebody else, or from a book.

I think it must be later.  The cube was put on the market in Hungary in 1977
and first exported in 1980.  Although earlier examples were privately
exported I presume.

Happens to me also.  I still use operators I found myself in favour of
(shorter) processes found later in books.  I remember them better!

I got one for my birthday in 1981 (yes, I was late).  By the end of the party
it was completely scrambled.  One long night and a long day afterwards had me
solve the cube.  Although at that moment I had not completely lined up
procedures to do it.  Later I more or less procedurized it.

Much stranger was my first encounter with Square 1.  As all puzzles it was
scrambled within minutes after I brought it home.  I tried to solve it, but
for some reason I did not yet see how to bring it back in the shape of a cube.
The next day when I came home from work it was in the shape of a cube.  It
appears that my 8 year old daughter had done that!  Solving the remainder was
fairly simple.

Allan C. Wechsler asks for general reminiscences from people who solved
the cube. It's just as well hardly anyone's replied, or the list would be
swamped with boring anecdotes ! So maybe I'll add an anecdote or two of
my own.

Very true. This reminds me of what I read in (I think) the math games
column of Scientific American, about mid-to-late 80's. The cubing craze had
largely passed, and someone who had been an addict, but hadn't touched it
for some years, had occasion to try it again. He realized with horror, that he
couldn't remember a single thing! However, as he began to fiddle with the 
cube rather disconsolately, he found himself automatically doing the right
things. "I couldn't remember how to do it, but my fingers could !!", he said.
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This was my experience too, a few years ago. It's quite uncanny, like 
starting to ride a bike again after decades of not doing; only more so.

That's what comes of sticking loyally to your first halfway-decent discoveries
on cube-solving. From madly over-addictive use, they become burned into
your brain tissue.   My own pet method has always been to put all the edges
right first, using only common sense (except maybe at the very end some
slight method needed); then put the corners right using the basic
"8-fold way"..... R~ U L U~ R U L~ U~ . We found this eightfold way quite
easy to remember, the face order is very natural, and the sequence of
clockwise vs anti-clockwise turns, i.e. ACCA CCAA, seems somehow like a 
sonnet rhyming scheme (now burnt irrevocably into my finger-moving cortex).

This eightfold way is just a commutator of a face move and (a commutator of
two face moves)); so it turns out to be group-theoretically natural, as
commutators do "as little as possible". The eight-fold way can also be 
viewed in a natural geometric light, as just a standard 3-permutation of
corners, similaritied away from one another to avoid interference. (Don't
know what the standard technical terms for all this are, sorry; it's probably
old hat to most readers here.) Viewing it this way, one can quickly re-create
several (8-fold) variants, and some 10-fold ones, all of the same type, and
all variously useful. By similarities, one can usually put a corner into a
more useful spot, so as to get two corners done at a time, with one 8-fold.

ENOUGH; of teaching grandmothers to suck eggs. I was going to reminisce. Not
many people seem to do the cube this way, that is, edges first. It was shown
to me by my late colleague Brent Wilson (the other of the "we" refered to 
above). At first it seemed a little unnatural, but once you get used to it, 
it seems super efficient. I suppose everyone feels that way about their own 
methods. The particular 8-fold mentioned above was my own invention, so I've 
always had a soft spot for it.

    Brent and I both started out on the cube the same way, which is
I suppose standard. We spent some little time learning to do the base. Then we
spent some considerably longer time learning to do the middle layer. We found
later that we had both expected the same thing:- that when the middle and
base layers were all successfully done, the top layer would automatically
have to be right !! So of course, we were both temporarily devastated when
it turned out otherwise; and we both realized that we were in the presence 
of a mighty puzzle, and were in for some great fun. So we went ahead and
discovered all the usual group-theoretic things, one by one, over the months.

I have anothger reminiscence to tell about my colleague. I once read of
someone, (J.H.Conway ?), who was alleged to do the cube behind his back !
Well Brent practiced this trick also (unaware of anyone else having
done it, if indeed it was done the same way, even). He invented the method
after having discovered the only all-commuting position, i.e. with all
edges flipped, corners all correct. He perfected a smooth method of doing
this behind his back. The trick is, of course, merely to have a pre-prepared
cube in this position. It doesn't QUITE look random, but if you ADD to it
a couple of random twists, it now looks totally random; at first (and second)
glance. He would show this "random" cube to us, let us hold it (very briefly!),
then take it and do the "all-flips" behind his back. Keeping up a continuous 
patter, as he brought it back he would be saying "...so there's only a couple 
of twists to go", and then as it appeared he would do the last two twists by
sight, without hesitation. As the two "randomizing" twists commute with
the other position, he didn't have to memorize them; indeed he could even
let the audience do them ! Of course this would mean he would have to have
the pure "flipped" pattern to start with, which was easier to detect, alas.

Well, one time, he was to give a talk to some school kids. He wanted to do
the cube behind his back, as a piece-de-resistance. He decided to train
himself up into being able to undo FOUR random twists by sight. He duly did
this. Then when the talk came around, he had a cube prepared in "all-flip"
position, with two twists added, to make it look quite random. Then, when
the highlight of the talk came around, he would display it to the class,
let one or two handle it briefly, to agree it was just another muddled up
cube. Then, HE WOULD EVEN ASK two members of the audience to add an extra
random twist each (just to prove the cube wasn't in a prepared position!)
Then he would do the all-flips operation behind his back, keeping up his
patter. He expected to be able to handle undoing the four random flips left
over, by sight, as he was completing his patter.

When the great event came along, everything went perfectly, without a hitch.
BUT, amazingly, by a 144-to-1 chance, the two flips that the audience added
exactly undid the two that he had put on himself !  So when he brought it
from behind his back, it was already perfectly done. Without batting an
eyelid, he brought his patter to a halt then and there. Needless to say, the
kids were even more staggered than they would have been otherwise. He
resisted all imploring entreaties to tell them how it was done (like all
good conjurers); and I don't thimk he ever did the trick again!

By great good luck, however, I have a vieotape of him doing this trick, from
the demo itself. So if any of you are ever in New Zealand, you can
look me up, and ask to see this amazing event !

Like Allan Wechsler, I would be delighted to hear anyone else's reminiscences,
or cube anecdotes generally. There must be tons, so, don't be shy!

Cheers,   Bill Taylor.

here's the way i describe this.  if  sigma  is a permutation on  n  symbols,
(say  1, 2, 3, ... , n), define the  "support" of  sigma  to be those
integers which are NOT fixed by  sigma.  if  tau  is another permutation
on the same set, such that   supp(sigma)  and  supp(tau)  are disjoint,
then  sigma  and  tau  commute (i.e. the commutator is the identity).
if  supp(sigma) intersect supp(tau)  has just one element, then the
commutator is a three-cycle.  as a rule of thumb, the smaller the
intersection of the supports, the smaller the support of the commutator.
in bill's example, ( R~ U L U~ R U L~ U~ ) the two permutations are
"R"  and  "U L U~", which only affect one corner in common.  (actually,
to consider the cube as a permutation group, each corner is really
3 objects, one for each orientation.)  but the analogy works well.
this idea is also helpful for creating three-cycles of corner-edge pairs
as well.  on the 5x5x5 cube, you can make three-cycles of large blocks.
in fact, a larger cube is probably a better visual aid for understanding/
explaining this concept.  another good commutator to try is with the
two sequences  "B1 D2 B3"  and  "R1 U2 R3", which affect two corners
in common.  (this is a fairly well-known maneuver.)

i've also experienced the exact same thing.  it seems as though my hands
remember a short sequence by which i've just conjugated some maneuver,
which helps at the end of the conjugation.  also in these commutators,
after i've done  A  and working on  B, it feels as though my hands are
anxious to undo  A, almost as if the cube is spring loaded and will just
snap back.

[lame story about a friend pulling some hoax deleted]

actually, i think i FINALLY understand the story.  the idea is that not
only is "brent" going to solve the cube behind his back, but he's also
going to do it WITHOUT first looking at it.  actually, the story isn't
nearly as lame as i first thought, after realizing this.

when i visited mit in 1984(?), i saw joe killian do the real trick.
i certainly would have complained if i hadn't been allowed to scramble
the cube exactly as i wished.  in fact, i may have even insisted that
he use MY cube (not too sure, though), just to be certain that the
surface hasn't been textured in any way.  it was quite impressive.
about 5 minutes of studying, then behind the back without peeking.
he said that all it took was a good system of remembering where all
the pieces are.  but i don't know what his system was.

by the way, bill, this "brent" wouldn't happen to be your friend who can
do the cube in 0.87 seconds, would he?  :-)

and speaking of tall tales, let's see if anyone can top this one:
back in the days when i was into speed, er, speed CUBING, i'd solve
the cube maybe 200 times every day.  for some reason, i got into the
habit of scrambling it behind my back (probably from listening to too
many complaints like "you're just watching all the moves you're doing!"
yeah, such a good complaint deserves such a fine solution.)  well,
anyway, one time i stopped scrambling it, and as usual, i get 15
second to study it (standard racing rules).  however, much to my
surprise, the cube was quite UNscrambled!  how could this possibly be?

well, the only explanation is certainly that after scrambling the cube
thousands of times, my hands began to get into a rhythm (maybe even a rut).
they'd just do the same sequence over and over again.  depending upon
my concentraion level, i'd find that sometimes i needed to make a
conscious effort to vary the sequence.  in fact, at least once i got
a pattern that i'd previously seen: it was 4 dots with 6 corners twisted
(hence has order 6).  so it's not too implausible.

like bill, and unlike dik, i spent quite some time struggling with
the cube before i finally solved it; probably about 6 or 7 weeks.
in fact for some time, probably about 2 weeks, i was convinced that
it couldn't be done, except by very dumb luck (as in story above).
of course, in those days, i hadn't heard of cube-lovers, hadn't even
seen a computer, didn't know the furst-hopcroft-luks algorithm, hadn't
even heard of anyone who could solve it ...  but i was just a high school
freshman (age 14) at the time.  i didn't even know what a group was!
this was shortly before the big craze started here in the u.s. (late 1980).
at school, some friends and i talked about it, but the main questions were:
how was it made, and how many combinations did it REALLY have?  i was truly
convinced that trying to solve it would be futile.  there was also a
shortage of them at the time, so i didn't get one until xmas.  in fact,
i remember the tv commercial that ideal put out.  they didn't even make
it clear that it actually turned in all possible directions!  we had all
sorts of ridiculous diagrams and ideas of cables and magnets, but none of
them quite worked.  and how could it turn in all directions?  i heard of a
bookstore somewhere that had one on display (but were otherwise sold out),
so i went to see it.  i remember spending a few minutes twisting it to
find an axis that wouldn't turn!  in fact, i could keep turning the same
face in the same direction, around and around and around ... and the
cables inside never got caught!

sometimes i'm amazed at just how stupid i can be when i try ...

anyway, the story about how i finally figured out how to solve it isn't
nearly as interesting.  after i first heard about people that could do it,
i started to work on it more seriously.  the key ideas were: get all
the corners, (here was something that you could do, and then still do
more without destroying what's already done.  but this was hard and
usually took more dumb luck and/or persistence.)  then two opposite layers.
(again, the middle slice still can turn, even with half turns on the
sides F, B, R, L.)  it took several days to flip the last two edges on
the middle layer.  (i just kept picking a different pair of opposite
layers to solve and stumbled across a U layer monoflip in the process.
of course, it took months before i realized what was actually happening.)
also figuring out how to take it apart (and finally seeing how it was made)
was helpful, 'cause then i could experiment easily.

well, i've droned on long enough.  anyone else got any interesting stories?

I think my solution may be considered cheating; but I was pretty proud of
it.  I had almost decided to give up on the thing.  But I had just
designed and built an 8080 'computer'.  It had 2k bytes of 2102's and
had to be programmed with binary switches and whenever the program
clobbered itself the entire program had to be re-entered in binary.
 
So I wrote a program to look for combinations of moves that left most
of the cube alone and only moved a few cubelets.  I studied the best of
these at great length and managed to combine some into 'better' moves,
eventually finding some that moved only three or so cubelets.  These
were then combined into a solution.  A rather god-awful solution I
think.  But my fingers learned the moves and I have never abandoned them
for fear of becoming totally confused.  The same ugly solution has been
passed on for at least one generation and perhaps will persist for
hundreds of years.
 
I still don't know what a group or commutator or ... is except what I
have deduced from reading mail from this group.  I get the front face
corners exactly right, the back corners in the proper position, and then
the back corners rotated properly.
 
Finally the edges go where they belong one at a time, first on the
front and back and finally the four on the sides/top/bottom.
 
I have noticed a lack of discussion of cubes that have pictures on
them such that the entire cube can be right except that a single
center can be upside-down.  I have also painted a 4x4x4 so that the
center 4 squares on each face have to be in the proper position.  Every
time I solve this cube I have to rediscover how it is done.  My fingers
refuse to learn it for me.
 
Behind the back?  You gotta be kidding!

Subject: Ultimate cube

The recent posting about cubes with photos has prompted me to post about my
favorite cube.  I picked this one up around the end of the BIG cube craze and
have kept it in my desk every since.  The cube looks like someone took a knife
to a normal solved cube and cut a diagonal 'x' through each face and folded the
flaps back down the sides.  This leads to a cube where opposing centers have an
'x' that has four colors in a mirror image.  (It is hard to describe, sorry.)
This cube has to be solved and then the centers oriented properly.  The slick
thing about the cube is that part way through the solution (fairly early on),
you may have to swap top for bottom and start over.  I like to fiddle with it
because at first glance it looks impossible to determine which cubelet is which
to a novice and to a semi-experienced cubist it is not as easy as it looks.
The cube was made by ULTRACO and is called ULTIMATE CUBE (copyrighted 1982).
Unfortunately, when I went back a few weeks later to buy a couple more cubes,
they were all gone and the sales people had no idea what I was talking about.
I think I got this cube at a Mall toy store.  If anyone knows where I can get
a replacement, I would be interested as the printing on a few squares has faded
just like my youth.

I would appreciate a few more details.  I think the color scheme of
each face you describe is something like

+-----+-----+-----+
|.1111|11111|1111.|
|44.11|11111|11.22|
|4444.|11111|.2222|

|4444.|33333|.2222|
|44.33|33333|33.22|
|.3333|33333|3333.|
+-----+-----+-----+

where 1,2,3, and 4 are distinct colors, but there are still several
ways to make the colors on different faces match up.  Look at a
corner, where the colors are

    +-------+
   /a.bbbbb/c\
  /aaa.bbb/ccc\
 /aaaaa.b/ccccc\
+-------+.......+
 \fffff.e\ddddd/
  \fff.eee\ddd/
   \f.eeeee\d/
    +-------+

That is, one corner is colored a/b, another c/d, and the third e/f,
where I expect some of a,b,c,d,e,f will be the same color.

One possibility was pictured in Hofstatder's Scientific American
article of February, 1981.  It had b=c,d=e,f=a and used twelve colors.
Jim Saxe and I were impressed by its wasteful use of color and its
failure to exhibit edge orientation.  From your remarks about turning
it over, I suspect this isn't what you mean.

You may be talking about the cube in which a=d,b=e,c=f which uses six
colors.  I would say it is as if you cut an 'x' on a cube and
exchanged each triangle with the other triangle on the same edge of
the cube.  That is a reasonably good coloring.  It isn't really
necessary to solve it twice, though.  To find out whether a given
corner goes on the top or bottom, look at the two colors that the
corner shares with the top face center.  Either the corner will have
the two colors in the same order as the top, or they will be reversed,
and that determines whether that corner goes on the top or bottom.
That tells you where the third color on that corner goes, and the
last color is determined by elimination.

There is an even more interesting coloring that uses only four colors.
In this coloring a=c=e and the other three colors are distinct.  Jim
Saxe and I came up with this coloring in our discussions of
Hofstatder's article.  It isn't quite symmetric enough, since its
reflection is a coloring in which b=d=f, a slightly different pattern.
Our discussions then led to the Tartan coloring we talked about in our
article of 16 February 1981.

The only cube in the archives called the Ultimate Cube is the one that
has ``over 43 quintillion solutions.''  It has all six sides colored
the same.

Hm, there are 12 edges on a cube.  That leaves half of them unaccounted
for.  What do they get?  (Note that you also have to shrink the 6
stickers, beacuse the face diagonal is longer than an edge.)

ULTIMATE CUBE  - sorry for my past misinformation this time I will try
and describe it by observation.

The cube is covered with 24 (4 to a face) 45, 45, 90 deg triangles.
 These triangles have there hypotenuse along the edge of the cube and
their 90 deg apex at the center of the center cubie.

Each opposite face has the same coloring except that the rotation of
the colors is opposite.  For example if the front face has a green,
orange, yellow and red triangle in clockwise order then in order for
the rear face to correspond it has a color rotation that is counter
clockwise.

The coloring scheme is that the top and bottom triangles on the side
faces (ie, front, right, left, back) are the same.  Six colors (
green, orange, yellow , red for the front and rear, and green,
white,yellow,blue for the sides and white, orange, blue, red for the
top and bottom)  are used and there are 4 triangles of each color. 

I think this is an accurate description, if there are questions please
ask I have my cube at my desk.

I also solved the cube alone at first.  I solved the top and middle first,
then spent some time pondering the final face.  I realized that manipulating
the corners was trickier than the edges because there were three faces rather
than two, so I solved the bottom corners and then got the bottom edges in
place.

I eventually got Singmaster's book, and found that my method of solving two
layers was faster than his.  I don't quite remember now, but I think it was
because I had found a quick method for flipping a piece on the middle edge
around if necessary (i.e., if it was in the correct position but flipped the
wrong way) without disturbing anything else on the top or middle of the cube.
Still, Singmaster's book had many patterns that were fun to go through and
see evolve.

I've long since lost my copy of Singmaster's book (one move too many); is it
still available?

Subject: cube theory


I've been doing some research to try and figure out some things
about the cube. I've also tried (unsuccessfully) to develop a sort
of CRC or checksum for the cube. With this cube "signature" I could
then find out which depth each pattern requires. I'm puzzled how
some computer types managed to find God's Algorithm for the 3x3x3
squares group. How do you keep track of all the patterns without
repeating yourself? If it is by holding all patterns in an array
the array must become huge.

                    Maximum Depth (using q and h moves)
                    -------------

2x2x2 sq group       4 (24 total states)
Pyraminx            11 (or 14 including the 3 tips)
2x2x2               11 (14 using q turns only)
3x3x3 corners only  11
3x3x3 sq group      15 (half turns only, don't know if using q improves
this)
3x3x2 domino        18 (for 1 solution)

A local maxima is a state where any possible move will bring you closer
to a solution. This can occur on the 2x2x2 at depth 4 and on the 3x3x3
at
depth 3. Note that all possible patterns at maximum depth are local
maxima,
however it is surprising that local maxima may occur in patterns much
closer to the surface.

To date, no work has been done to determine the depth of the
dodecahedron
(megaminx) or square 1.

Some questions:

What pattern is an example of local maxima? e.g. 3x3x3 at depth 3
-> 12-flip, 12-flip 8-twist

        q+h     Depth   Patterns
2x2x2             1        9
3x3x3             1       18
Dodecahedron      1       48

        Analysis of the full cube group
        -------------------------------

* Work by Zoltan Kaufmann

Notes:  At 1 move deep each of the 6 sides can turn 3 ways (+ - 2)
giving 18 distinct patterns

        At 2 moves deep it is redundant to turn the same side again
        so 5 sides can turn 3 ways so 18x15=270
        However, with opposite turns order is not significant,
        e.g. T,D = D,T   F,B = B,F   L,R = R,L
        since each of these can occur in 9 different ways there are 27
        redundancies so 270 - 27 = 243

        At 3 moves deep with the first 2 moves on opposite faces don't
        turn the face used in move one since:
        T,D,T = T2,D   F,B,F = F2,B   L,R,L = L2,R
        This can occur in 3x3x3=27 ways for each case so 81 are dropped
        (Remember the first 2 moves have already been weeded of
        redundancy!)
        Also when the 2nd and 3rd moves are of opposite faces
   e.g. T,R,L = T,L,R  B,R,L = B,L,R   F,R,L = F,L,R   D,R,L = D,L,R
        T,B,F = T,F,B  D,B,F = D,F,B   L,B,F = L,F,B   R,B,F = R,F,B
        F,T,D = F,D,T  B,T,D = B,D,T   L,T,D = L,D,T   R,T,D = R,D,T

    since each of these can occur 27 different ways in each of the
    cases this gives 27x12 = 324 redundancies
    Thus 243x15 = 3645, removing the redundancies gives 3645-81-324=3240

        At 4 moves deep.... still working on this one! Zoltan Kaufmann
        has done 4 moves deep using quarter turns, but has anyone
        calculated farther using q and h turns? I'd be interested in
        the source code of any programs people have written on finding
        path-lengths. Also what is an example of a local maxima close
        to the surface, e.g. 4 moves. I believe Jim Saxe and Dan Hoey
        have done some work in this regard.

        One more question: What is the maximum number of moves required
        if you do the 3x3x3 one face last? The best results I've seen
        are 19 q and h moves.

Dear Mark,

I sent you email on 8 June.  Did you receive it?  Are you interested
in acquiring a Tartan cube? Did you ever get Minh Thai's book on
Rubik's Revenge?

With respect to the 3x3x3 squares group,

> How do you keep track of all the patterns without repeating yourself?

there are several ways.  The most general is to use the Sims table
(aka the FHL table) for the subgroup, which gives a mixed-base
enumeration of the positions.  See my message of 1 February 1981.

That's ``local maximum''.  ``Maxima'' is the plural of ``maximum''.

We call such positions ``global maxima'' because they are at the
overall maximum depth.  The statement is then that every global
maximum is a local maximum.

Well, I've done some looking at it.  Since my initial remarks on 23
September 1982, I've figured out a way to generate a recurrence for
it, but it seems I haven't put it down anywhere.  Are you interested?
(Do I have to tell anyone to answer that question only to
Hoey@AIC.NRL.Navy.Mil, not the list?)

Jim Saxe and I listed the 25 symmetric local maxima in our message on
Symmetry and Local Maxima, dated 14 December 1980.  We verified Jim's
conjecture that the four-spot is a local maximum, but not on the
grounds of symmetry, and reported that on 22 March 1981.  Do you have
access to the cube-lovers archives?

This approach appeared on 9 January 1981.  It showed how to follow the
argument to 25 QT, and to get what are still the best known lower bounds
for the ordinary cube and for the supergroup.

It's known there are no local maxima at 7 QT or less.  The shortest
known local maxima are Pons Asinorum and the four-spot, both at 12 QT.
I know of no results between 8 and 11 QT.

DESCRIPTION:  This puzzle is similar to the Hungarian puzzle UFO but a
little more complex.   The puzzle has a cube at its center which is
cut in half and these two pieces can rotate with respect to each
other.  In the plane of this cut there are four hubs that can rotate,
2 on the x-axis and 2 on the y-axis.  These hubs have a hexagonal
cross section and are divided into six equilateral pie shaped wedges.
 By rotating the hubs and then by rotating the center cube 3 hub
pieces on each axle are moved at a time.

The hub pieces have 2 colors each one perpendicular to the axis and
the other on its edge.  There are 2 wedges with the same coloring.
 The center cube is also colored.  The object is to arrange the hub
pieces so that the edge pieces align with the center cube and that the
perpendicular sides are solid colored and aligned.

Alexandria Bay is in the Thousand Islands region near where I-81
crosses into Canada.

Mazeland Gardens is an entertainment center (the property was formerly
a miniature golf course) of mazes.  It has 2 mazes that are
constructed with arborvitae hedges, one a 1/2 acre in size and the
other a full acre.  In addition it has 2 mazes that are constructed
with stakes and colored tape to mark the walls.

I went without kids and had fun.  The families with kids looked like
they were having a good time.  If you are in the area you might want
to give it a try.

PS   The fellow working the desk said that there is are 2 other mazes
on the east coast that he is aware of:
  one is in North Carolina somewhere and the other is in Daytona beach

As far as selecting the chain goes, I have been meaning to look into
that a bit.  Of course, since Bill posted, the results of Hans
Kloosterman, Michael Reid, and Dik Winter have shown that you indeed
get a lot of leverage.  I would like to get some idea of the possible
group towers, for a more general approach to selecting which towers
give you leverage.  But what I haven't been able to figure out is how
to figure out which coset of G1 wrt G2 you're in.  I've been able to
figure it out for specific groups, but if we wanted to do this for a
lot of chains, we would need to do coset identification given G1 and
G2 as a table of strong generators.  We could in fact ensure that the
strong generators of G1 form a subset of those of G2.  Is that a hard
thing to do?

More to the point, I've heard that the FHL algorithm should more
properly be called Sims's algorithm and that Furst, Hopcroft, and Luks
mostly analyzed the performance.  I haven't read anything by Sims on
it, though.  Is there a good reference that treats this sort of
algorithm in a more general setting?  I have toyed with implementing
the Jerrum improvements to FHL, but it is a mighty complicated beast.
Also, a talk announced in the archives mentioned 1987 work by Akos
Seress that was supposed to be an improvement, but I don't know
whether it got published.  Anyway, if not, do you know if there is a
good general way of finding out which coset a given position is in.

For some reason, I never saw Bill's message.  I just noticed it when
comparing my files against the archives.  [ Archives seekers note: the

There were some tables in Singmaster with more examples, and there are
the stuck-faces groups that I wrote about on 21 July 1981.  I seem to
recall there was some non-obvious equivalence between two groups,
perhaps the slice group and the antislice group.  But a general list
of popular subgroups would be interesting.  Of course a list of *all*
the subgroups would have, um, over three beelion of them.  I suspect
it has more than 4.3x10^19.  Does anyone know a good way of counting
how many subgroups there are?  Or even a way of estimating the number?
By comparison, the symmetries of the cube form a 48-element group with
98 subgroups.

All we should really be interested in are conjugate classes of
subgroups.  I think.

well, i don't know ALL the subgroups, but i did some investigation
before devising my three stage algorithm.  one of the great advantages
of thistlethwaite's four stage method is that since each subgroup
restricts the motion of various faces, it is routine to exhaustively
search the cosets spaces at each stage, since we only make twists that
leave us in the given space.  so i looked at all possible ways of
restricting various faces, up to symmetry.  there are three possible
restrictions for a face:  no restriction, half turns only, no turns.
our problem is then coloring the faces of the cube with 3 colors, up
to symmetry (rigid and non-rigid).  the polya polynomial for the faces
of the cube under this group of symmetries is:

          ( x^6 + 3 x^5 + 9 x^4 + 13 x^3 + 14 x^2 + 8 x ) / 48

so there are 56 different ways to three-color the faces.  i spent the
better part of an evening and most of the night calculating (by hand)
the orders of these subgroups.  shortly thereafter, i saw an announcement
for the group theory package GAP, which specifically mentions calculating
the order of the rubik's cube group.  so i used the package to verify my
answers.  here's the list (i don't see a canonical way of ordering them):

subgroups with the same order are equal (possibly after necessary rotation
of the cube) with the following exceptions: (3, 4), (11, 12), (30, 31) and
(30, 32).  equality of various pairs of subgroups can be obtained from the
three maneuvers:

     R L F2 R2 F B L F2 B2 R2 F2 B2 L F B3 R3 L3  ~  U2 ,
                so that  <L, F, R, B> = <L, F, R, B, U2>,

     F2 U2 L2 F2 R2 U2 F2 R F2 U2 R2 F2 L2 U2 F2  ~  L ,
                so that  <U2, F2, R, L2> = <U2, F2, R, L>  and

     R2 F2 B2 L2 U2 L2 F2 B2 R2  ~  D2 ,
                so that  <U2, F2, R2, L2, B2> = <U2, F2, R2, L2, B2, D2>.


thistlethwaite's filtration is  56 --> 53 --> 49 --> 47 --> 1.
kloosterman replaced  47  by a subgroup not on this list (one not obtained
by restricting face turns).  call this  56 --> 53 --> 49 --> kl --> 1.
(in his final stage, kloosterman allows all twists available in the
subgroup  49.)  my filtration is  56 --> 19 --> 17 --> 1 , which was
chosen precisely because it had the smallest size of the largest coset
space amongst all three stage filtrations with subgroups from the above.
winter's filtration is  56 --> 49 --> kl --> 1.  it may be the case that
this can be improved by replacing  kl  with  17 , and allowing all face
turns available in the subgroup  49.  i haven't had the time to look into
this yet.

using subgroups on the list above, we see that the only reasonable two
stage filtrations are:

56 --> 29 --> 1    with coset sizes     8868372480    and   4877107200
56 --> 22 --> 1    with coset sizes    13302558720    and   3251404800
56 --> 27 --> 1    with coset sizes    17736744960    and   2438553600
56 --> 49 --> 1    with coset sizes     2217093120    and  19508428800
56 --> 13 --> 1    with coset sizes    26605117440    and   1625702400

of these, the best seems to be  56 --> 49 --> 1 , since it has the most
symmetries (16).  the number of symmetries the others have is  4 (for 29),
8 (for 22), 2 (for 27) and 2 (for 13).  furthermore, aside from subgroup
49, the other intermediate groups seem to have too much restriction to
be efficient.  also, of course, dik winter has already calculated that
the stage  56 --> 49  can always be accomplished in 12 face turns.

i also seem to have missed both allen's post as well as bill's reply.
perhaps 'twas the twilight zone between the start of my subscription to
cube-lovers and the time it takes recent messages to reach the archives.

however, i don't find the archives on  ftp.lcs , but rather on
ftp.ai.mit.edu.  also i see we've spawned  cube-mail-8.Z.

in addition to those listed above there are subgroups generated by
combinations of face turns and slice turns, e.g.  <U, M_R>, <U2, M_R>,
<U, R, M_R>, etc.  i haven't looked at these at all.  there's a lot of
work to be done here.

Subject: rare variants


   Hello fellow cube lovers...

Although this is not a strict Rubik's cube type post I think it should
be of some interest to the other subscribers.

I collect cube variants, and although the variations in cube colours are
interesting my great interest is variants in mechanisms (which require
different solving techniques).

I've been corresponding with other cube buffs around the world in an
effort to record ALL the significant cube variants and I use the
following classification system:

        M = Manufactured in quantity, readily available
        S = Produced in small quantities only
        R = Rare, a few prototypes exist, difficult to get
        P = Prototype, the inventor has the only one!
        C = Exists only as a computer simulation and/or cardboard mockup
        I = Intellectual idea only (perhaps on pencil and paper)

In my opinion, Square 1 is the most interesting cube variant in recent
years, and it gave me the most trouble! Here are some of the tough ones
to get, and if anyone knows of any others email me and I'll maintain a
list of them...

        Trajber's Octahedron (R)  Evidently Greg Stevens owns one
        Octahedral puzzle with rotating faces

        Extended Missing Link (S)
        Missing Link with 6 tiers

        Master Pyraminx (P??)
        Looks like a normal pyraminx BUT it's edges can turn (just the
        strip) 180 degrees and 2 vertices can be swapped

        Space Grenade (P??)
        Other weird one from Uwe Meffert. Mike Green of Puzzletts showed
        me a picture of this, still not sure how it moves

        Pyraminx Disc Chess (S)
        Planar puzzle with 6 rotating discs, similar to Raba's Rotoscope

        Masterball (S)
        This seems to be a recent one, it's like a VIP sphere but it has
        8 vertical cuts instead of one (like a tangerine) and 4
        hortizontal sections

        Halpern's Tetrahedron (P) Also called Pyraminx Tetrahedron
        Like a pyraminx BUT it has face centres which are small
triangles
        and it's faces rotate. Very rare.

        Pyraminx Hexagon (C) Jerry Slocum says he got a cardboard mockup
        of this from Meffert. I wrote a computer simulation of it.
Imagine a Rubik's cube with an N-prism shape, thus the top and bottom
        are hexagons, and there are 6 (rather than 4) adjacent sides.
        The top and bottom can rotate 60 degrees and the adjacent sides
        can only rotate 180 degrees.

        Twist Torus (I) My own concept. Imagine a torus segmented 4 ways
        length-wise so it can slide around. Additionally there are
        12 rings around the circumference which can rotate at right
        angles to the segments. Still thinking of a good colour
        arrangement for this one.

        Super Skewb (I) Another idea of mine. It's a skewb and a 2x2x2
        cube! A compound of two mechanisms.

        Honourable mention: Pyraminx Star, Puck, Ufo, Trick Haus
        (Anyone got multiples of these)

Imagine my disappointment when I found out the Mach Ball, Skewb and
Moody Ball all have the same basic mechanism! Anyway if anyone has
a rare variant or puzzle idea please post here or email me...

Oh, I'm drooling all over my keyboard.

Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Constantin (Pirkach 14, D-8535 ah I forgot the name
of the city but it's near Nurnberg, Germany) makes lots of variations on
cubes and skewbs etc., but the underlying mechanisms all seem to be standard
ones.

Hmmmm.  I might confess to owning two Trick Hauses in exchange for something
of sufficient persuasion, such as some of the others listed in Mr. Longridge's
post.  In hopes of being able to exchange for some neat stuff, I'd better not
mention that Mr. Constantin can sell Trick Hauses for something around DM 20.

>Imagine my disappointment when I found out the Mach Ball, Skewb and

Yeah, but with Mach Ball you have to orient the square-like pieces.
Haven't seen Moody Ball.

Unless the the Bundespost will deliver mail to "a city near Nurnberg" I think
you're pretty safe.  Unless of course you'll post the full address?

I was telling the truth -- I forgot the name of the city while in the middle
of typing.  Meanwhile, I had posted the full address on rec.puzzles a few
months ago.

Just now, I have recalled the name of the city, and here is the full address
(if I don't forget again while typing :-)

I have a puzzle not in your list; it's rare enough that I've never seen

Barrel".

Imagine a transparent cylinder divided into 6 circular slices.  Slices 2-5
each have 5 pockets equally spaced around the circumference, just below the
surface (see left figure below).  Slices 1 and 6 have three pockets in
positions corresponding to 3 of the 5 (see right figure).

	       *******       		       *******       

Through the center of the cylinder runs a piece with a cap on each end.
The caps each have 3 prongs poking into the cylinder, lined up on the
3 openings in slices 1 and 6.  However, the central piece is long enough
that if the prongs are pushed into slice 6, the prongs at the other end
are lifted out of slice 1, and vice versa.  So, at any given time, three
of the end pockets are filled by one of the endcaps.  The other 23 pockets
contain colored balls.

Originally, the 3 balls in the unpronged endcap are black, and the balls
in the other slices are lined up by color; i.e. 4 blue balls lined up
above one another in slices 2-5, 4 green balls, likewise lined up, etc.
The possible moves are:

1) Slide the endcaps up and down.  E.g., from the starting position, this
would push three balls of different colors into slice 6, and push the 3
black balls from slice 1 into slice 2 (and also push various balls of the
same color down, but that has no visible effect).

2) Turn slices 2 and 3 together; they do not move separately.

3) Turn slices 4 and 5 together; ditto.

Slices 1 and 6 are fixed, so they always line up with the end cap prongs
and with each other.

That's all there is to it.  It certainly has the "cubish" feel to me, in
that it's impossible to make single moves that affect only a small portion
of the puzzle.

Don.Woods@eng.sun.com writes about the barrel puzzle.  If I recall correctly,
this was made by Nintendo before they switched to computer games.  I also
believe the name was "Ten Billion Barrel."  (Mine is buried somewhere and
I couldn't solve it, but I didn't want to buy the book that was published
at one time, sigh...  I didn't need a book for the cube, so why should I
cheat for a piddly little barrel... sigh.)

Anyway, there are still a few available.  But I have to warn, if anyone wants
one, it will cost more for postage and for my train fare going to the store,
than to buy the thing.  If anyone wants one, we can arrange it by e-mail.
But I'd really prefer to trade for some of those wonderful things that
Mr. Longridge described.  (I'm drooling all over my keyboard again, just
remembering them.)

                Notes on the Pyraminx
                ---------------------

According to Dr. Ronald Turner-Smith there are 5 different Pyraminx
puzzles, all of different complexity. The following are listed in
order from easiest to hardest (to the best of my knowledge):

Pyraminx Star: Easiest of all pyraminx??
               A simplification of the popular pyraminx because of the
               little uni-coloured (usually grey or silver) tetrahedrons
               on the 3 middle pieces of each face. Effectively all
               middle pieces on this pyraminx are the same colour!

Snub Pyraminx: Same as standard pyraminx with tips removed

Popular Pyraminx: The standard pyraminx of which appeared in vast
                  quanities after the cube caught on.

Senior Pyraminx: This is a mystery puzzle. No one seems to know anything
                 about it, yet Turner-Smith's book refers to it and
                 gives the maximum number of moves for it! It is between
                 the Popular Pyraminx and Master Pyraminx in difficulty.

Master Pyraminx: All the moves of the standard pyraminx plus 180 degree
                 turns of the edges (just the strip, not the whole face)

                 446,965,972,992,000 combinations. Interestingly in the
                 ads for Dr. Ronald Turner-Smith's book "The Amazing
                 Pyraminx" the Master Pyraminx is cited as a puzzle
                 superior to Rubik's Cube because there are no centre
                 pieces and it's harder! (Both points debatable IMHO)

Also Turner-Smith gives the following maximum number of moves for
each type of Pyraminx puzzle: (The popular pyraminx is now known
to be 11 moves at most or 14 moves if the tips are included)

Type 1          24 moves   ??
Type 2          28 moves   ??
Type 3          38 moves   ??
Type 4         215 moves   (Senior Pyraminx)
Type 5         255 moves   (Master Pyraminx)

Also it is known that transparent pyraminx puzzles were made. This
would be a good idea for the cube as well. Meffert also considered
a textured pyraminx for the blind, and ones with leather and wood
finishes.

All the post-cube puzzles compare themselves to the cube, such as
the Master Pyraminx, and more recently Smart Alex. It seems that
Rubik's Cube is the benchmark for all others to compare with.

Alas, Uwe Meffert's puzzle club was a bust. Barring unique prototypes
(perhaps Singmaster or Hofstadter have a Master Pyraminx, I'll check)
none of the following were produced: (most of these are documented in
the extremely rare "Pyraminx The Exciting new 1982 range" or the even
more obscure 1983 edition booklet. Both of these have full colour pages
with photos of cardboard mockups of all the variants.)

1982:

Pyraminx Star (exists in small quanities, in Constantin's catalog)
Pyraminx Pentagon, Pyraminx Hexagon (Computer Simulation/Mockup only)
  One can also imagine Septagons, Octagons etc...
Pyraminx Barrel Junior, Pyraminx Barrel Senior (Mockup only)
Pyraminx Disc Chess (Prototypes exist)
Pyraminx Ultimate (as shown in July 82 Scientific American, Mockup)
Pyraminx Crystal, Pyraminx Ball (Mockups, July 82 S.A)
  I'd really like to see the mechanism for a working crystal!
Pyraminx Assembly Puzzles, 4 types (They exist)
Pyraminx Octahedron (An octahedral skewb, I believe Braun & Bandelow
made
  some) Gerd Braun is the inventor of the Moody Ball (rare but exists)
Pyraminx Tetrahedron (Ben Halpern made a prototype)

1983:

Space Grenade (???)
Crystal Ball (Looks like an orb, definitely not the same though)

However....

Just a few days ago I got Constantin's catalog. Surprisingly there is
a picture of Josef Trajber's Octahedron inside. Also there is a picture
of what appears to be a Pyraminx Ball. Other ideas he includes are a
2x2x2 siamese cube, new variants on Fisher's cube, e.g. Fisher's Domino,
and a Pyraminx Ultimate for 180 DM!

...and so the search for new cube variants continues. Please send me
your
comments (Does anyone actually own a working Master Pyraminx??) I'm
also interested in exchanging full cube lists with other collectors.

    I have one of the textured pyraminx.  I had to mail order it from
Hong Kong in the early '80s.

Little smaller than its square root.  Are you having fun yet?

   Does anyone out there know what is the cubed root of 81?

   Just wondering....

Well, the "root of 81" is 9 (recall that when you don't say
what kind of root you want, the default is "square"), and
9 cubed is 729.

... Eh?  Oh, you meant the "cube root", not the "cubed root"?
Well, that's another kettle of fish entirely.  The n'th root
of x is equal to x raised to the power 1/n.  I fed this to
my friendly Common Lisp system:

> (expt 81 1/3)
4.3267487109222245

If I were you, I wouldn't trust the last few digits of this
approximation, but fifteen decimal places ought to hold you
for now.

Here's how you could estimate it in your head.
Note that 81 = 3 to the fourth power, so

  1/3      4  1/3    4/3        1/3
81    = ( 3  )    = 3    = 3 ( 3    )

Now, the cube root of 3 is surely between 1 and 2,
because 1 cubed is 1 and 2 cubed is 8.  So the cube
root of 3 is 1 plus some smaller fractional amount x.
               3                2    3
So  3 = (1 + x)  = 1 + 3 x + 3 x  + x     (binomial expansion).

                  3
Let's ignore the x  term, which is probably small because
x is sort of small.  Then

             2                   2
1 + 3 x + 3 x  = 3     so   x + x  = 2/3 .

                            2
Hm... if x = 1/2, then x + x  = 3/4, which is a bit
                                               2
too big.  So figure x is about 0.4; then  x + x  = .4 + .16 = .56
which is too small.  So probably x is about 0,45 or so.

So the cube root of 3 is about 1.45, and the cube root of
81 is 3 times that, or about 4.35 -- not a bad approximation.

Let's see: the root of 81 is 9.  9 cubed is 729.

Is everybody ready for more reminiscences?

I got my first cube at Harrad's in London in October of 1980 while I was on
vacation there with my girl friend.  I spent every non-touristy moment
working out and recording moves until, on day 13, I got the final face.

When we got back to the States, my girl friend and I broke up.  Do you think
there's a moral here?

Yes, at least three:

(1)  Every non-touristy moment that you weren't recording moves, you should
       have spent with your girl friend instead of working out  :-)

(2)  You should have given equal attention to the final face and to your
       girl friend's face  :-)

(3)  You should have chosen a girl friend who could solve the cube, like
       I did.

But I thank you for warning about the dangers of getting back to the States.
Maybe I shouldn't go back after all  :-)

Games magazine seems to like the puzzle.  They included Mastermind Rainbow
(the polychromatic version) in this year's "Games 100" listing.  Their
write-up isn't very informative, but there's a picture.  It appears on page
59 of the Dec. '92 issue.

By the way, they indicate that the puzzle is available from Baekgaard at
1-800-323-5413.

Masterball is similar to the VIP Sphere and Orb puzzles.

It is nicely made and has been available in europe for
 a couple of years.

I believe ISHI is also selling it.

If you don't have the ISHI x-mas flyer call them
and get it.  This flyer has several unique items
for slae, eg, 5x5x5, skewb

Such questions should be addressed to Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU.  But
since you asked publicly, I might as well answer publicly as well.

If you are interested in the archives of the Cube-Lovers mailing list:

Using FTP, connect to FTP.AI.MIT.EDU, login as "anonymous" (any password),
and in the directory "pub/cube-lovers" you will find the nine (compressed)
files "cube-mail-0.Z" through "cube-mail-8.Z".

Archive vital statistics (when uncompressed):

	   File		   From		   To	     Size (bytes)
	   ----		   ----		   --	     ------------
	cube-mail-0	12 Jul 80	23 Oct 80	185037
	cube-mail-1	 3 Nov 80	 9 Jan 81	135719
	cube-mail-2	10 Jan 81	 3 Aug 81	138566
	cube-mail-3	 3 Aug 81	 3 May 82	137753
	cube-mail-4	 4 May 81	11 Dec 82	139660
	cube-mail-5	11 Dec 82	 6 Jan 87	173364
	cube-mail-6	10 Jan 87	13 Apr 90	216733
	cube-mail-7	12 Oct 90	 9 Sep 91	137508
	cube-mail-8	 1 Nov 91	25 May 92	171205

In addition, the file "recent-mail" contains a copy of the currently active
section of the archive.  (Unfortunately, due to the way mail works here at
the AI Lab, it is not possible to have new mail accumulate directly into
this file, so there may be some delay before a new message arrives here.)
Finally, the file "README" contains the information you are currently reading.

Going through the archives I found a message from Mike Reid, dated
August 20, where he investigates the filtration through different
subgroups.  I missed the original, but he says:
 > winter's filtration is  56 --> 49 --> kl --> 1.  it may be the case that
 > this can be improved by replacing  kl  with  17 , and allowing all face

For the record, the filtration is from Herbert Kociemba, and it is:
	56 --> 49 --> 1.
So there is no intermediate stage between 49 and 1.

With thanks to Dan Hoey for getting me on the right track, I
have finally got most of the squares group evaluted. The big
breakthru was developing a checksum for a squares position.

I know it's been done before, but I wanted to prove to myself
I could do it on a mere 386 with 4 megs of memory. My
latest program (rubik5.exe) took 24 hours to number the squares
group up to 8 moves deep. The point of all this was to create
a squares group database to aid in developing an optimal
solver for the cube. Ultimately the database will have an entry
for every squares group position, along with it's optimal
solution. I would be interested in hearing from any others who
have created such a database, and what type of compression or
checksum was used for the arrangement.

Also I've received a call from Richard Schneider. He is publishing
a comprehensive book on square 1, plus a follow-up book on
pretty patterns and shapes. This will be available in the States
shortly.

I haven't been seeing anything from cube-lovers in a while,
I hope it's still up and running.

To: Mike Reid --- Hope you see this! Any further progress been
                  made on God's Algorithm? I'm still trying to
catch up. I'm still interested in that code of yours to find
improvements on some pretty patterns I've discovered.

Anyways here is what my program has found so far:

Squares group (u2, d2, l2, r2, f2, b2)

Moves Deep          Number of patterns
----------          ------------------
   0                      1
   1                      6
   2                     27
   3                    120
   4                    519
   5                   1932
   6                   6484
   7                  20310
   8                  53000 (and counting)  :->

Got to improve it's speed....
