   ...  [ Archives seekers note: the archives have moved to FTP.LCS.MIT.EDU
   (18.26.0.36), still in directory /pub/cube-lovers. ] ...

No, that isn't right.  The correct address is FTP.AI.MIT.EDU (which is at
128.52.32.11 -- at least this week).  Here is the text I currently send to
people who are new subscribers or who express interest in the archives:

Using FTP, connect to FTP.AI.MIT.EDU, login as "anonymous" (any password),
and in the directory "pub/cube-lovers" you will find the nine (compressed)
files "cube-mail-0.Z" through "cube-mail-8.Z".

Archive vital statistics (when uncompressed):

	   File		   From		   To	     Size (bytes)
	   ----		   ----		   --	     ------------
	cube-mail-0	12 Jul 80	23 Oct 80	185037
	cube-mail-1	 3 Nov 80	 9 Jan 81	135719
	cube-mail-2	10 Jan 81	 3 Aug 81	138566
	cube-mail-3	 3 Aug 81	 3 May 82	137753
	cube-mail-4	 4 May 81	11 Dec 82	139660
	cube-mail-5	11 Dec 82	 6 Jan 87	173364
	cube-mail-6	10 Jan 87	13 Apr 90	216733
	cube-mail-7	12 Oct 90	 9 Sep 91	137508
	cube-mail-8	 1 Nov 91	25 May 92	171205

In addition, the file "recent-mail" contains a copy of the currently active
section of the archive.  (Unfortunately, due to the way mail works here at
the AI Lab, it is not possible to have new mail accumulate directly into
this file, so there may be some delay before a new message arrives here.)
