    Much stranger was my first encounter with Square 1.  As all puzzles it was
    scrambled within minutes after I brought it home.  I tried to solve it, but
    for some reason I did not yet see how to bring it back in the shape of a cube.
    The next day when I came home from work it was in the shape of a cube.  It
    appears that my 8 year old daughter had done that!  Solving the remainder was
    fairly simple.

Our four-year-old managed to assemble our Snafooz into a cube once.  No
one else has been able to do it, and he can't duplicate his success.
(He can't even read.)
