Is everybody ready for more reminiscences?

I got my first cube at Harrad's in London in October of 1980 while I was on
vacation there with my girl friend.  I spent every non-touristy moment
working out and recording moves until, on day 13, I got the final face.

When we got back to the States, my girl friend and I broke up.  Do you think
there's a moral here?
