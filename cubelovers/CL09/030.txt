I also solved the cube alone at first.  I solved the top and middle first,
then spent some time pondering the final face.  I realized that manipulating
the corners was trickier than the edges because there were three faces rather
than two, so I solved the bottom corners and then got the bottom edges in
place.

I eventually got Singmaster's book, and found that my method of solving two
layers was faster than his.  I don't quite remember now, but I think it was
because I had found a quick method for flipping a piece on the middle edge
around if necessary (i.e., if it was in the correct position but flipped the
wrong way) without disturbing anything else on the top or middle of the cube.
Still, Singmaster's book had many patterns that were fun to go through and
see evolve.

I've long since lost my copy of Singmaster's book (one move too many); is it
still available?
