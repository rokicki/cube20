	In a wonderful article about Claude Shannon in the April 92 IEEE
Spectrum, a few lines from his poem called "a Rubric on Rubik's Cubics"
(to the tune of Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay):

Respect your cube and keep it clean,
Lube your cube with Vaseline.
Beware the dreaded cubist's thumb,
the calloused hands and fingers numb.
No borrower nor lender be,
Rude folk might switch two tabs on thee.
The most unkindest switch of all,
Into Insolubility.

[Chorus]

In-sol-u-bil-i-ty!
The strangest place to be
However you persist
Solutions don't exist!
