   Could somebody please remove me from this list.
   Thanks in advance.

As everyone is informed when they subscribe, administrative requests should
be directed to Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU (me).  Even if you lost my
original greeting message, the "-Request" suffix is a sufficiently
widespread convention for mailing lists that you should have tried it
first, before bothering the entire mailing list.

STEFANO@agrclu.st.it, I have removed you.

Kees.Goet@rcl.wau.nl, I will be sending you separate mail about your
subscription.
