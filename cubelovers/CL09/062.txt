Games magazine seems to like the puzzle.  They included Mastermind Rainbow
(the polychromatic version) in this year's "Games 100" listing.  Their
write-up isn't very informative, but there's a picture.  It appears on page
59 of the Dec. '92 issue.

By the way, they indicate that the puzzle is available from Baekgaard at
1-800-323-5413.
