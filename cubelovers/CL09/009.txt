Subject: Magic Domino part3

Considering my previous fiasco, I have now incorporated the changes needed to
make the magic domino calculating program working into the program that
calculated the corners on a 3x3x3 cube.  The results still match, which
gives me confidence that the algorithms are correct indeed.  Moreover,
it reduced the time to do the 3x3x3 corner calculations to 8 minutes.
