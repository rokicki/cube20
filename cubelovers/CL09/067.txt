Subject: Where are the archives?

   From: Dik.Winter@cwi.nl
   Can somebody tell me where the cube-lovers archives are maintained at this
   moment?

Such questions should be addressed to Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.MIT.EDU.  But
since you asked publicly, I might as well answer publicly as well.

If you are interested in the archives of the Cube-Lovers mailing list:

Using FTP, connect to FTP.AI.MIT.EDU, login as "anonymous" (any password),
and in the directory "pub/cube-lovers" you will find the nine (compressed)
files "cube-mail-0.Z" through "cube-mail-8.Z".

Archive vital statistics (when uncompressed):

	   File		   From		   To	     Size (bytes)
	   ----		   ----		   --	     ------------
	cube-mail-0	12 Jul 80	23 Oct 80	185037
	cube-mail-1	 3 Nov 80	 9 Jan 81	135719
	cube-mail-2	10 Jan 81	 3 Aug 81	138566
	cube-mail-3	 3 Aug 81	 3 May 82	137753
	cube-mail-4	 4 May 81	11 Dec 82	139660
	cube-mail-5	11 Dec 82	 6 Jan 87	173364
	cube-mail-6	10 Jan 87	13 Apr 90	216733
	cube-mail-7	12 Oct 90	 9 Sep 91	137508
	cube-mail-8	 1 Nov 91	25 May 92	171205

In addition, the file "recent-mail" contains a copy of the currently active
section of the archive.  (Unfortunately, due to the way mail works here at
the AI Lab, it is not possible to have new mail accumulate directly into
this file, so there may be some delay before a new message arrives here.)
Finally, the file "README" contains the information you are currently reading.
