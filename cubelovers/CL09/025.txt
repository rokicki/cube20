name "ultimate cube" is a brand name or TM

my description of its coloring is:

still has six solid colors
if we visualize a standard cube as 
a box with 6 stickers, 1 to each flat face
the the ultimate cube has these 6 stickers
translated and rotated so that
4 of these squares come together on a center
cubie with the diagonal of each square
laying along the edge of the cube.
