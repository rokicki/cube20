I think it must be later.  The cube was put on the market in Hungary in 1977
and first exported in 1980.  Although earlier examples were privately
exported I presume.

Happens to me also.  I still use operators I found myself in favour of
(shorter) processes found later in books.  I remember them better!

I got one for my birthday in 1981 (yes, I was late).  By the end of the party
it was completely scrambled.  One long night and a long day afterwards had me
solve the cube.  Although at that moment I had not completely lined up
procedures to do it.  Later I more or less procedurized it.

Much stranger was my first encounter with Square 1.  As all puzzles it was
scrambled within minutes after I brought it home.  I tried to solve it, but
for some reason I did not yet see how to bring it back in the shape of a cube.
The next day when I came home from work it was in the shape of a cube.  It
appears that my 8 year old daughter had done that!  Solving the remainder was
fairly simple.
