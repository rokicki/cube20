Yes, at least three:

(1)  Every non-touristy moment that you weren't recording moves, you should
       have spent with your girl friend instead of working out  :-)

(2)  You should have given equal attention to the final face and to your
       girl friend's face  :-)

(3)  You should have chosen a girl friend who could solve the cube, like
       I did.

But I thank you for warning about the dangers of getting back to the States.
Maybe I shouldn't go back after all  :-)
