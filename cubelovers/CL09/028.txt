Subject: Please, quick, I need the address of the new puzzle shop in Amsterdam


I believe it was with the Dutch Cubists' Club newletter that I got an
advertisement of a new puzzle shop in Amsterdam. I tried to find this
advertisement, not, but could not. I'm leaving Finland on Thursday
afternoon, and will be passing through Amsterdam, so I would be forever
grateful to any kind soul who would  send me the address!!!

	Thanks, 
	Timo (tjj@rolf.helsinki.fi)
