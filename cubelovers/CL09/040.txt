well, i don't know ALL the subgroups, but i did some investigation
before devising my three stage algorithm.  one of the great advantages
of thistlethwaite's four stage method is that since each subgroup
restricts the motion of various faces, it is routine to exhaustively
search the cosets spaces at each stage, since we only make twists that
leave us in the given space.  so i looked at all possible ways of
restricting various faces, up to symmetry.  there are three possible
restrictions for a face:  no restriction, half turns only, no turns.
our problem is then coloring the faces of the cube with 3 colors, up
to symmetry (rigid and non-rigid).  the polya polynomial for the faces
of the cube under this group of symmetries is:

          ( x^6 + 3 x^5 + 9 x^4 + 13 x^3 + 14 x^2 + 8 x ) / 48

so there are 56 different ways to three-color the faces.  i spent the
better part of an evening and most of the night calculating (by hand)
the orders of these subgroups.  shortly thereafter, i saw an announcement
for the group theory package GAP, which specifically mentions calculating
the order of the rubik's cube group.  so i used the package to verify my
answers.  here's the list (i don't see a canonical way of ordering them):

subgroups with the same order are equal (possibly after necessary rotation
of the cube) with the following exceptions: (3, 4), (11, 12), (30, 31) and
(30, 32).  equality of various pairs of subgroups can be obtained from the
three maneuvers:

     R L F2 R2 F B L F2 B2 R2 F2 B2 L F B3 R3 L3  ~  U2 ,
                so that  <L, F, R, B> = <L, F, R, B, U2>,

     F2 U2 L2 F2 R2 U2 F2 R F2 U2 R2 F2 L2 U2 F2  ~  L ,
                so that  <U2, F2, R, L2> = <U2, F2, R, L>  and

     R2 F2 B2 L2 U2 L2 F2 B2 R2  ~  D2 ,
                so that  <U2, F2, R2, L2, B2> = <U2, F2, R2, L2, B2, D2>.


thistlethwaite's filtration is  56 --> 53 --> 49 --> 47 --> 1.
kloosterman replaced  47  by a subgroup not on this list (one not obtained
by restricting face turns).  call this  56 --> 53 --> 49 --> kl --> 1.
(in his final stage, kloosterman allows all twists available in the
subgroup  49.)  my filtration is  56 --> 19 --> 17 --> 1 , which was
chosen precisely because it had the smallest size of the largest coset
space amongst all three stage filtrations with subgroups from the above.
winter's filtration is  56 --> 49 --> kl --> 1.  it may be the case that
this can be improved by replacing  kl  with  17 , and allowing all face
turns available in the subgroup  49.  i haven't had the time to look into
this yet.

using subgroups on the list above, we see that the only reasonable two
stage filtrations are:

56 --> 29 --> 1    with coset sizes     8868372480    and   4877107200
56 --> 22 --> 1    with coset sizes    13302558720    and   3251404800
56 --> 27 --> 1    with coset sizes    17736744960    and   2438553600
56 --> 49 --> 1    with coset sizes     2217093120    and  19508428800
56 --> 13 --> 1    with coset sizes    26605117440    and   1625702400

of these, the best seems to be  56 --> 49 --> 1 , since it has the most
symmetries (16).  the number of symmetries the others have is  4 (for 29),
8 (for 22), 2 (for 27) and 2 (for 13).  furthermore, aside from subgroup
49, the other intermediate groups seem to have too much restriction to
be efficient.  also, of course, dik winter has already calculated that
the stage  56 --> 49  can always be accomplished in 12 face turns.

i also seem to have missed both allen's post as well as bill's reply.
perhaps 'twas the twilight zone between the start of my subscription to
cube-lovers and the time it takes recent messages to reach the archives.

however, i don't find the archives on  ftp.lcs , but rather on
ftp.ai.mit.edu.  also i see we've spawned  cube-mail-8.Z.

in addition to those listed above there are subgroups generated by
combinations of face turns and slice turns, e.g.  <U, M_R>, <U2, M_R>,
<U, R, M_R>, etc.  i haven't looked at these at all.  there's a lot of
work to be done here.
