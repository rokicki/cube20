MAZELAND GARDENS and DISCOVERY CENTER

Alexandria Bay, NY 13607

Alexandria Bay is in the Thousand Islands region near where I-81
crosses into Canada.

Mazeland Gardens is an entertainment center (the property was formerly
a miniature golf course) of mazes.  It has 2 mazes that are
constructed with arborvitae hedges, one a 1/2 acre in size and the
other a full acre.  In addition it has 2 mazes that are constructed
with stakes and colored tape to mark the walls.

I went without kids and had fun.  The families with kids looked like
they were having a good time.  If you are in the area you might want
to give it a try.

PS   The fellow working the desk said that there is are 2 other mazes
on the east coast that he is aware of:
  one is in North Carolina somewhere and the other is in Daytona beach
