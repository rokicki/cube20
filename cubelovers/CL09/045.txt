I was telling the truth -- I forgot the name of the city while in the middle
of typing.  Meanwhile, I had posted the full address on rec.puzzles a few

Just now, I have recalled the name of the city, and here is the full address
(if I don't forget again while typing :-)

Constantin Geduldspiele
Pirkach 14
D-8535 Emskirchen
