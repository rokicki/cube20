						Of course a list of *all*
    the subgroups would have, um, over three beelion of them.  I suspect
    it has more than 4.3x10^19.  Does anyone know a good way of counting
    how many subgroups there are?  Or even a way of estimating the number?
    By comparison, the symmetries of the cube form a 48-element group with
    98 subgroups.

All we should really be interested in are conjugate classes of
subgroups.  I think.
