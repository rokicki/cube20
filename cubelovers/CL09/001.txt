Unfortunately Dik's conjecture for phase 2 is too optimistic.
Recall the maximum distances of the 4 stages of my algorithm:
 1.  7 moves within the group <R, L, F, B, U,D>
 2. 10 moves within the group <R, L, F2,B2,U,D>
 3.  8 moves within the group <R2,L2,F2,B2,U,D>
 4. 18 moves within the group <R2,L2,F2,B2,U,D>

(Stage 3 and 4 together requires at most 25 moves.)

These number of moves are minimal and cannot be improved within their
group of moves. (Stage 2 can also not be improved using all moves.)
