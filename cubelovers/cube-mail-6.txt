Those of you who look through the archives of old Cube-Lovers mail will
notice that I have split off a new section of the archive.  The mail now
lives on MIT-AI in the files:

AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL0	;oldest mail in forward order
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL1	;next oldest mail in forward order
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL2	;more of same
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL3	;still more of same
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL4	;yet more
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL5	;more still
AI:ALAN;CUBE MAIL	;recent mail in reverse order

As always files can be FTP'd from MIT-AI without an account.  (And yes, the
spaces in those filenames are a significant part of our filename syntax.)

While I have everyone's attention let me remind you all that last year
Cube-Lovers moved from its original home on MIT-MC to MIT-AI.  Our new
addresses are Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for submissions and
Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.AI.MIT.EDU for administrivia.

If you have occasion to send mail to Cube-Lovers, you will generally find
that a fair number of copies of your message will be returned to you by
various mailers around the world for various reasons.  This is always a
problem with old, and fairly quiet mailing lists.  If you would like to be
helpful, you can collect these errors and forward them to
Cube-Lovers-Request (I will eventually flush anyone who is consistently
unreachable), but under no condition should you forward the error message
to Cube-Lovers itself.  Thank you.

Perhaps someone on this list can help me locate an item that appeared in
the Mathamatical Games section of Scientific American.  If memory
serves, the primary subject of the article was Erno Rubik and the
Hungarian School of Architecture.  The particular item I am looking for
is a puzzle that waas given to entering students.  They were shown a
picture of a monument and were told to duplicate it using paper and
scissors.  The article contained the picture.  Can anyone give me the
issue that this appeared in?

And while we're at it, does any have a machine-readable copy of the
current rules for Eleusis?  If not, the issue they last appeared in.

          Thanks much,

1.  My crack puzzle team has added four squares to "MAGIC".  This puzzle has
much more variability in making planar patterns (I count doubled up squares) ,
while retaining the same flavor as the original puzzle.  Some examples:

     XXXXXX            XXXX              XXXX                     XXXX
     XXXXXX            XXXX              X    X                     XXXX
                            XXXX             X    X                     XX
                                                XXXX                     XX

Has anybody else changed the number of squares?  

2.  Has anybody speculated on Rubik's next puzzle based on this hinge mechanism?
 My puzzle team thinks a equilateral triangles instead of squares has potential.
 Any comments?

RE:  New versions of MAGIC

1.  The 2/14/87 edition of the "Toy & Hobby World's Show (ie, the NY Toy  Show)
Daily" announced the planned 1987 additions to the MAGIC line.  It said "Rubik's
MAgic puzzle, which debuted in October, 1986, is updated with a Masters Edition
puzzle, Unlink The Rings, featuring 12 panels and multi-color, multi-graphic
designs on a silvery Mylar-foil background.

Rubik's Magic Strategy Game features the colors of the original puzzle in a
tic-tac-toe game; the difference is that the pieces are colored black on one
side and silver on the other, and players can flip opponents' pieces before
making a move."

2.  As previously noted on this board it is fairly simple to make your own 12
piece MAGIC.   I am using MAcDraw to experiment with graphic patterns.  I have
not decided on which graphic(s) I like best yet.

3.  As an aside there are "CLONES"  of MAGIC around and Matchbox is prosecuting.
 I am not aware of exactly what is protected so using a different number of
squares or different graphics might be legal.

RE: CONSTRUCTION

Since I have suggested that people might want to take their MAGICs apart I have
prepared the following directions.  I would appreciate comments as to their
clarity and completeness.  

...................................
For those of you who would like to take MAGIC apart and then put it back
together here are some hints.  First get out your tools, a heavy duty paper clip
or a nut pick will do (black electrical tape is helpful for keeping the strings
in place when putting it back together) and then pull the string over the corner
of a square (strings do break, the weak point is the crimp so minimize the
pulling and stretching you do by the crimp also when you reassemble put the
crimp in the middle of a long channel).  Keep doing this until the puzzle is
completely disassembled. 

If you failed to take notes you may have missed the following.  The loops of
string (they are actually nylon fishline and they are redundant, ie, each path
is taken by two strings, with 16 strings in all) are threaded through the
channels, one set of strings takes the long path on the front face and the other
set of strings takes the short path on the front face (the opposite is true on
the back face OR adjacent square) with both sets of strings going in the same
direction on the same face.    Thus the strings on the front faces are
perpendicular to those on the back face of the same square.   NOTE:  The strings
are not really redundant.  They are placed to maximize lateral stability (twist
of the squares).  This is done by having the strings (there are two) of a given
channel routing form the same sandwiching order where they cross over to the
next square.  The string that uses the long channel and the string that uses the
short channel cross at separarte points.  Each string criss crosses itself at
this point (making 4 string segments at the cross over point) with one part of
itself in the NE channel and its other part in the NW channel.  The stability is
gained by having the NE going string sandwiched between the NW going string (or
vice versa) for both crossover points, ie , sets of strings.   Both patterns
shown below are used on the same set of three squares (THIS UNIT IS CALLED A
TRIPLET.).  

               string #1 in                    string #2 in
        SHORT channel ON TOP       LONG channel ON TOP 
             for squares 1&3              for squares 1&3

               ---- ---- ----             ---- ----  ----

After having made two triplets there will be two squares free.  They are used to
join the triplets.  Place one of this extra squares between the two triplets,
ie, where the "AND" is in the diagram above and thread the strings through the
channels as if this square was the middle square of a triplet (REMEMBER THAT the
STRINGS GO ONLY ONE WAY ON each face OF A SQUARE).  THEREFORE, THE ENDS OF THE
PREVIOUSLY MADE TRIPLETS WILL BE THE ENDS OF THIS NEW TRIPLET ALSO.  THIS WILL
CAUSE THESE ENDS TO HAVE TWICE AS MANY STRINGS AS THE MIDDLE SQUARES OF THE
TRIPLETS AND IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT MAGIC YOU WILL SEE THAT THE NUMBER OF
STRINGS IN THE CHANNELS ALTERNATES FROM SINGLE DENSITY TO DOUBLE DENSITY, ie,
either 2 or 4.



CUSTOMIZATION OF MAGIC

In the disassembly process an easy thing to do is to break the circularity of
the puzzle by removing one square, leaving a chain of seven squares.  This can
be done by lifting the strings off a single density square.  The square will
come out but its strings will stil be entangled with the puzzle.  You will now
have to temporarily lift strings off the adjacent squares to disentangle them. 
This can be done easily.  You now have a chain of seven squares.  Each hinge can
be manipulated without the constraint of being connected as a loop. A basic
hinge between two squares has the following motions:
NOTE:  The flipping of the pieces changes the direction of the squares as shown
by the arrows.

The robustness of this hinge permits the making of all possible planar patterns
that has each square butting up to the edge of another square.

I have been reviewing issues of the "CUBIC CIRCULAR" ,a set of which I recently
obatined form Singmaster, and would like references to  information on the
following:

1-   a book Rubik edited called  "A BUVOS KOCKA"  which was to be also done in
english by PENGUIN.

2 -  Rubik's newsletter "RUBIK'S - LOGIC AND FANTASY DIMENSIONS"

3-  "TEN BILLION BARREL" puzzle invented by Gumpei Yokoi.  Possibly a reference
to a published?? solution by Trevor Hutton.  This is supposed to be harder than
the cube and is available for about $6 at Child World in northen NJ.

4 -  "TRILLION" a flat version of 3.

Yard sales.  Even if you don't find one for sale at the sale, you can
probably ask the person running the sale if they have one they
wouldn't mind selling.

HI CUBE-LOVERS, 

I understand that the "Puzzle Exhibition" tour has been changed and that it
won't be coming to MIT until the fall.  Does anybody have more information.  

One of my co-workers advised me that she saw a puzzle called "Rubik's SQUARE",
not magic, in the San Jose airport gift shop.  Does anybody know what this is
and where it can be obtained or even a picture seen.

I have been working on alternate designs for the 8 square magic with some
success.  If anybody out there is also doing the same I would like to talk, swap
designs, etc.   If anybody has suggestions for alternate designs I would
appreciate receiving them.

The Future is Puzzling and Cubing is Forever,

RE:  SEARCH FOR CUBES

1.  The large chains are slowly clearing out the surplus stocks of cubes.  The
best for a revenge is "THRIFT DRUG" probably around $5, also try KAYBEE.  If
this fails send me your address and I will send you one a competitive price.

2.  As I have previously posted I am also trying to buy up surplus cubes and
make them available to cube collectors.  If anybody would like a list send me
your name and address and I will mail it to you.  If you are looking for a
particular cube ask for it I will tell you where to get it.  I correspond with
Singmaster, Gillen, Helm, Bandelow, Hess, Cecil Smith, Wally Webster about
cubes.

3.  If anybody knows of a good source of cubes a wholesale prices I would
appreciate the reference.

THIS MAYBE A DUPLICATE - I AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY MAILER

HI CUBE-LOVERS, 

I understand that the "Puzzle Exhibition" tour has been changed and that it
won't be coming to MIT until the fall.  Does anybody have more information.  

One of my co-workers advised me that she saw a puzzle called "Rubik's SQUARE",
not magic, in the San Jose airport gift shop.  Does anybody know what this is
and where it can be obtained or even a picture seen.

I have been working on alternate designs for the 8 square magic with some
success.  If anybody out there is also doing the same I would like to talk, swap
designs, etc.   If anybody has suggestions for alternate designs I would
appreciate receiving them.

The Future is Puzzling and Cubing is Forever,

Mathematically inclined Cube Hackers in the Boston area might find the
following seminar interesting.  All I know about this is what I read here
in the abstract.  (I'll bet its been a while since anyone on this list did
any serious thinking about the Cube as a permutation group...)

			  PERMUTATION GROUPS IN NC

				 AKOS SERESS
			Mathematical Institute of the
			Hungarian Academy of Sciences

Given a permutation group G on an n-element set A by a list of generators, we
present NC-algorithms (parallel algorithms using (log n)^c time and
n^c processors) for basic permutation group manipulation (membership
testing, order).  These problems have been suggested by Cook and McKenzie to
be LOGSPACE-complete for P and therefore not in NC unless NC=P.
    We shall outline previous work by Luks on the subject and focus on the
key problems left open by Luks' 1986 FOCS paper.  In particular, we shall
discuss in detail, how to construct in NC any permutation from a given set of
generators of the symmetric group.
    The presentation will be elementary, although the analysis of the
algorithms depends in several ways on consequences of the classification of
finite simple groups.
    Our methods have sequential consequences as well.  We obtain algorithms
for basic permutation group management with O(n^4(log n)^c) running
time, improving one order of magnitude from the best prevously known results
(Knuth, Babai, and Jerrum).
    This is joint work with Laszlo Babai and Eugene M. Luks.

			    HOW TO SOLVE THE CUBE

				 Adi Shamir
				Applied Math
		       The Weizmann Institute, Israel

   Given k generators for a permutation group G, it is easy to verify that a
permutation belongs to G but NP-complete to find a short representation of
the permutation as a product of the generators.  In this talk we describe a
new algorithm for computing the shortest representation which significantly
improves the time/space complexities of previous algorithms.  The new
algorithm is particularly interesting in the context of Rubik's cube since it
makes it possible to solve previously intractable problems such as finding
the shortest sequence of moves which fixes a given state or the optimal
subroutine for permuting certain subcubes, in just 2^40 time and 2^20 space,
compared to 2^80 time in previous algorithms.

Subject:  Shamir's talk really was about how to solve the cube!
To: CUBE-LOVERS@AI.AI.MIT.EDU
Message-ID: <205924.870527.ALAN@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>

Here is a rough sketch of Shamir's algorithm, as he presented it at the
talk last Friday.  The fact that I have typed this in does not
-necessarily- indicate a willingness on my part to supply any further
details.  Nor do I guarantee that my description will enable you to
correctly reconstruct the algorithm, although I tried to make it
comprehensible.

I think Shamir gave credits for a couple of graduate students of his for
some of this, but I didn't make a note of their names.  It is always nice
to give people proper credit...

You are given a scrambling of the cube, and you want to know if the cube
can be restored in 4*N quarter twists.  (Shamir is a half-twister, but I in
this message I will rephrase everything in quarter-twist terms.  It makes
little difference, the algorithm applies equally well to any set of
generators.)

Represent a permutation as a vector that simply lists the values of the
permutation.  That is, if the permutation sends 0 to 7, 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 3
to 1, etc., then the vector [7, 2, 4, 1, ...] represents it.

We will be ordering permutations in "dictionary order".  That is, a
permutation sigma is less than a permutation tau just in case there exists
an i such that

          sigma(i) < tau(i) and for all j < i, sigma(j) = tau(j).


We start by generating a list of all permutations generated by N quarter
twists.  The algorithm requires space to store several datastructures
proportional to the size of this list.  (If N=5, this list has 93840
elements.  Its size is about 10^N for the cube group in quarter twists.
For an arbitrary group and generators it will be exponential in N.)

Now what we would like to do is generate -and- -sort- the list of all
permutations generated by 2*N quarter twists.  We could do this by simply
multiplying all possible pairs of elements from our list, and then sorting
again, but this generates an absurdly large list, that it takes an absurd
amount of effort to sort.

The trick is to generate this list of products both incrementally and
already sorted!  This gives us the ability to ask for the -next- element of
the list, which is exactly what we need:  Given two such permutation-list
generators we can easily scan through both lists to see if any element
occurs in both lists (using an algorithm that the reader can easily
reconstruct).  Thus we can build one generator for the list of all
positions 2*N twists away from solved, and another for positions 2*N twists
away from the given one, and if we find an element on both lists, then we
have a 4*N twist solution.

OK, so how do we construct this magic generator?

First we take the list of length N permutations and make it into a tree.
There will be one leaf for each permutation in the list.  All permutations
that share a common prefix will share a common internal node in the tree.
For example, given the permutations:

                              [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
                              [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]
                              [1, 0, 3, 4, 2]
                              [1, 3, 0, 4, 2]
                              [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]

we get the tree:

                                      [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
                                     /
                                    /2
                         [0]--[0, 1]
                        /   1       \3
                       /             \
                      /               [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]
                     /
                    /0        [1, 0, 3, 4, 2]
                   /         /
                  /         /0
                []-------[1]
                  \  1      \3
                   \         \
                    \2        [1, 3, 0, 4, 2]
                     \
                      \
                       \
                        \
                         [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]

Now consider one element of the original list, say 

                         sigma = [2, 3, 1, 4, 0].

We want to find the permutation tau, such that sigma * tau is smallest in
dictionary order.  So, what is the first entry of sigma * tau?  That is,
what is sigma(tau(0))?  Well, looking at sigma we can see that -if-
tau(0) = 4, then sigma(tau(0)) = 0.  Unfortunately their are no
permutations in our list that start with 4, but we can get
sigma(tau(0)) = 1 if tau(0) = 2.  Now there is only one such permutation on
our list, so that must be it:

              tau = [2, 3, 1, 4, 0] (= sigma as it happens).

What about the tau such that sigma * tau is -second- smallest?  We have
exhausted permutations with tau(0) = 2, what should we consider next?  Well,
if tau(0) = 0, then sigma(tau(0)) = 2, so we should next consider
permutations that start with 0.  After that, we should do those that start
with 1, followed by those that start with 3.

The exact same argument applies to tau(1).  That is, to minimize the
product, first consider permutations such that tau(1) = 4, followed by
tau(1) = 2, then tau(1) = 0, then tau(1) = 1, and finally tau(1) = 3.

Thus you can see that to generate the sigma * tau products in order, we can
just take tau to be successive leaf nodes in the above tree, where we order
the inferiors of any internal node in the order 4, 2, 0, 1, 3.  It is easy
to generate this ordering given sigma.

Now for -each- permutation sigma in our original list we will be taking a
different walk through the tree using a different ordering of inferiors.
So we maintain a queue of pairs <sigma, tau>, sorted according to
sigma * tau.  When called upon to generate the next element of the
list-of-products, we take the head of the queue (smallest) and return it.
Then we advance to the next tau for the given sigma, and insert the new
pair <sigma, tau'> back into the queue.

Modifying this construction to generate permutations of the scrambled
position, rather than solved is easily accomplished by first composing the
inverse of the scrambling permutation with each element of the list of
length N permutations.  Now we combine each element of this list with each
element of the same tree as above.

Analysis of space and time requirements left to the reader.

I understand that there are 20 such centers in Japan and that the "MAZE PRODUCTS
COMPANY" (a NOB enterprise) is going to bring it to the USA.  

Nob's centers have mazes designed by a New Zealander, Stuart Landsborough and
puzzle shops that sell Nob's puzzles.  There was also an article in the dec 86
Sci Amer, pg140 on Labryinths which referenced a book called "Celebration of
Mazes" available from Minotaur Designs, 247 Montgomery st, Jersey City, NJ 07302

I'm looking for information about the books _Beyond Language_ and
_Language on Vacation_ by Dmitri Borgmann.  I can't find them in any
of the various Books in Print, so they're either no longer in print,
or from a small publisher.  In any event, I would appreciate it if
someone could send me the following information:

  1. The correct spelling of the titles and the author's name (if I
     don't have them correct above).

  2. The publisher, and the publisher's address if it's available in
     either of the books.

  3. The ISBN.

Thanx for any information anyone can provide!

Subject: Info on Dmitri Borgmann books
Date: Mon, 08 Jun 87 11:51:05 EDT

Brian Matthews asked for information about Dmitri Borgmann books.  Here it is.
Dmitri Borgmann published three books:

	Language On Vacation (An Olio of Orthographical Oddities)
		Copyright 1965.  Published by Charles Scribner's Sons

	Beyond Language (Adventures in Word and Thought)
		Copyright 1967.  Published by Charles Scribner's Sons

	Curious Crosswords (edited and annotated by Borgmann)
		Copyright 1970.  Published by Charles Scribner's Sons

_Language on Vacation_ is a paperback.  _Beyond Language_ is a hardcover.
_Curious Crosswords_ is a large format paperback.  So far as I know, all three
have been out of print for years and it's unlikely they'll be reprinted.
But, there's good news -- you can get them all as follows:

_Curious Crosswords_ and _Language on Vacation_ are available for $7.00 each
from

	National Library Publications
	Box 73
	Brooklyn, NY 11234

Don't forget to add 10 percent for postage and handling.  I got my copies
from this place and had no trouble with them.  _Beyond Language_ can only
be found by combing used book stores, which I did for several years.  Then
I found two of them!  If you promise to love the book, I'll send you one of
them for $10.00.  Please note that it is missing its cover, but is otherwise
in perfect condition.

If you are a maniac about the peculiarities of language, all three of these
are must-buys.  You should also consider subscribing to the journal "Word
Ways" for $15.00 a year.  It's a quarterly 64-page journal devoted to the
kind of stuff Dmitri Borgmann writes about (weird spellings, words with
greatest number of vowels, pangrams, dictionaries, etc., etc.).  You can
order a subscription from Faith W. Eckler, Spring Valley Road, Morristown,
New Jersey 07960.

By the way, Dmitri Borgmann died last year of a heart attack.  It was a
great blow to logologists everywhere.  "Word Ways" has been running
memorial issues filled with unpublished articles by him.

Hope this helps!

Indeed.  I find this will happen with any word, if you examine it

1.   The dutch cubists club is alive and well.   It is probably the only
organized group of people still collecting and distributing information about
Rubik's cube and related combinatorial and geometrical puzzles.  

2.  This spring in order to improve contacts between cubists they started
publishing their newsletter in english (issue #14 dated 3/87).  The newsleter is
distributed free to members of the club.   Membership for 1987 is  US$5.   A
photocopied set of the newsletters, issues 1-13, written in DUTCH is also
available for  US$7.    To order either of these send a POSTAL MONEY ORDER to: 
Anton Hanegraaf,  Heemskerkstraat,  6662 AL ELST,  The Netherlands.

3.  The table of contents from issue #14 follows (it is 14 double sided folded 8

Have I got an interesting puzzle to at least look at:


           GIVE or TAKE

You can take 45 from 45 and have
a remainder of 45. A trick, yes, but it
can be done.
           Give it a try
             It's fun


There is an obvious answer - You take 45 eggs from 45 chickens and you still
                             have 45 chickens left.
Can you find the other answer?
GOOD LUCK!

Just get together two score and five gunslingers, only one of whom has two
guns, and take away one of the guns (assuming you survive :-) ).

I have to disagree with your obvious answer for 2 reasons.

	1.  Using that kind of logic there are innumerable answers such as:

	You take 45 donuts from 45 bakers and you still have 45 bakers!

	2.  Your answer is not correct if you consider eggs to be chickens in
their primary stage of development.  Then you really have 90 chickens!!


Here is another puzzle to solve (perhaps a bit too easy):

	How can the following equation be correct?

	80 - 50 = 0

Simple!  Your friend has $45.  You TAKE his $45.  You have $45 remaining.

The recent spate of messages to Cube-Lovers having to do with wordplay,
numerology, etc. was caused by an automatic feed from some usenet newsgroup
for puzzle fans.  This was set up without without asking
Cube-Lovers-Request's permission or even informing us that it had been
done.  I believe that I have now arranged for the feed to be terminated, so
there shouldn't be any more such messages.

If you were actually interested in some of the things that were sent, you
can probably arrange to subscribe to the newsgroup directly.  But please
don't ask me how to do it, I haven't even been able to get anyone to tell
me the -name- of the newsgroup in question!

Here is my answer:  First you start off with 4 cows three in each row,
                    then you take 4 cows aways, and then you have
                    8 cows remaining.

Message-Id: <551515254/hoey@nrl-aic>

Last year Rodney Hoffman cited an article by J. A. Eidswick (in the
March 1986 Math Monthly) that develops a general approach to analyzing
several magic polyhedra.  Did anyone else go read this one?  Of
particular interest is Eidswick's analysis of the larger three-
dimensional cubes.  The article shows that the only constraints on
these cubes are the permutation parity constraints implicit in the
generators and the corner and edge orientation constraints we already
know about.  Eidswick shows that this even holds for the ``theoretical
invisible group'', where we imagine that the interior of the magic
N-cube is a magic (N-2)-cube that must be solved simultaneously.  The
solution method he presents is to solve the parity problems by applying
zero or one qtw at each of the floor(N/2) depths, then to work with
commutators (aka mono-ops) to solve the rest of the cube, piece by
piece.

As a supplement to that article, here are the number of positions
G[t](N) of the N^3 magic cube, where t, a subset of {s,m,i},
indicates the set of traits we find interesting:

    s (for N odd) indicates that are working in the Supergroup, and
      so take account of twists of the face centers.
    m (for N > 3) indicates that the pieces are marked so that we
      take account of the permutation of the identically-colored
      pieces on a face.
    i (for N > 3) indicates that we are working in the theoretical
      invisible group, and solve the pieces on the interior of the
      cube as well as the exterior.  I will assume that the M and S
      traits apply to the interior pieces as if they were on the
      exterior of a smaller cube.

A formula for the number of positions is

               2^A (8!/2 3^7)^B (12!/2 2^11)^C (4^6/2)^D (24!/2)^E
    G[t](N) =  ---------------------------------------------------
                                 24^F (24^6/2)^G

The following table gives the values of parameters A-G, depending on
the traits, and on whether N is even or odd.

        Parameter   Traits  (N odd)              (N even)

(Parity)        A =         (N-1)/2              N/2

Subject: Lower bounds for the 3^N cubes
To: Cube-Lovers@AI.AI.MIT.EDU
Message-Id: <551537688/hoey@nrl-aic>

The ability to calculate the sizes of large cube groups prompts me to
generalize the lower-bound machinery we have for magic cubes, to see
how it behaves asymptotically.  The machinery we have uses the three
isomorphic Abelian groups A(N) generated by the three sets of parallel
generators for the N^3 cube.  Since the group of the N^3 cube is a
quotient of the free product of three copies of A(N), we can
upper-bound the number of positions close to SOLVED in the cube group
by the number of positions close to SOLVED in the free product.  This
implies a lower bound for the diameter of the cube group.

One useful tool for group diameter work is the Poincare series.  The
Poincare series of a finitely generated group is the power series p(z)
in which the coefficient of z^d is the number of group elements of
length d.  When the group is finite, the power series is a polynomial.
For our analysis, we will need the Poincare polynomial of A(N).

When N is odd, the analysis is straightforward, since A(N) is the
direct product of (N-1) cyclic groups of order 4.  Let S be the set of
generators for A(N), |S| = 2(N-1) including inverses.  Now suppose we
take a subset T of S.  We can construct a group element F(T) by
multiplying the elements of T together, *except* that when both a
generator G and its inverse G' appear in T we replace them with G^2.
It is easy to see that F is a bijection between the power set of S and
the group A(N).  The interesting thing about F is that the length of
F(T) is |T|.  So the number of length-d elements of A(N) is the number
of d-element subsets of S, and the binomial theorem gives us the
Poincare polynomial of A(N):  p(z) = (z+1)^(2(N-1)).

When N is even, we are in considerably murkier waters.  It's easy
enough in the Cutist analysis I presented on 1 June 1982:  There are
N-1 ways of cutting the cube into two pieces perpendicular to each
axis, and so 2(N-1) generators of A(N), and the analysis proceeds as
above.  But a year later I converted to Eccentric Slabism, and I
suppose I should present that analysis here.  In the Slabist
interpretation, the generators of A(N) are the 2N quarter-turns of
unit-thickness slabs.  But to avoid charging for whole-cube moves, we
must single out a particular slab S0 for which a turn is equivalent to
turning each of the other slabs {S1,S2,...,SN} in the opposite
direction.  The Poincare polynomial for A(N) is
        p(z) = ((z+1) (SUM[0<=i<N/2] C(N-1,i) z^i))^2
where C(N,r) is the binomial coefficient.  This can be shown by
constraining T to include fewer than N/2 of {S1,...,SN} and fewer than
N/2 of {S1',...,SN'} in the previous analysis.  Showing that this is a
length-preserving bijection is tricky, and I will spare you the gory
details, barring pleas to the contrary.  Does anyone know of a closed
form for that sum?

In general, the free product of three copies of A(N) has Poincare
series
    q(z) = p(z)/(3 - 2p(z))
where p(z) is the Poincare series of A(N).  The series q(z) can be
expanded term by term using the technique I sent in on 9 January 1981.
As in that message, we add up every other coefficient through that of
z^d to produce an upper bound on the number of positions of the
move-parity of d reachable in d qtw or fewer, and if this is less than
half the size of the group of the cube we have a lower-bound of d+2 qtw
to solve the cube.  I've done this for the cubes up to 10^3, and I get
the following lower bounds.  The traits are as given in my previous
message.

Asymptotically, the coefficients of q(z) grow by a factor approaching
R, where p(1/R) = 3/2.  This allows us to calculate the rate at which
the free product grows.  Here's a table of the smaller values.

    N    R (exact)                   R (approx)

    2    1/((3/2)^(1/2) - 1)          4.449
    3    1/((3/2)^(1/4) - 1)          9.371
    4    6/((4 + 6^(3/2))^(1/2) - 4) 18.519
    5    1/((3/2)^(1/8) - 1)         19.235
    6                                29.047
    7    1/((3/2)^(1/12) - 1)        29.098
    8                                38.960
    9    1/((3/2)^(1/16) - 1)        38.963
   11    1/((3/2)^(1/20) - 1)        48.828 (for even N>=10, use
   13    1/((3/2)^(1/24) - 1)        58.693  approximation for N+1).
   15    1/((3/2)^(1/28) - 1)        68.558
   17    1/((3/2)^(1/32) - 1)        78.423
   19    1/((3/2)^(1/36) - 1)        88.288
   21    1/((3/2)^(1/40) - 1)        98.153

Clearly R grows proportionally to N, so our asymptotic lower bound will
be somewhere around Log[N](G[t](n)), which is O(N^3/log(n)) for the
theoretical invisible groups (trait i) and O(N^2/log(n)) for the
surface groups.  This is as opposed to Eidswick's upper bounds, which
are O(N^3) and O(N^2), respectively.  So the gap increases, but not
terribly quickly.

It is interesting to compare this with the sort of behavior we see in
the 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle, ..., N^2-1-puzzles, as Jim Saxe suggested to
me many years ago.  The N^2-1-puzzle has (N^2)!/2 positions and 2 to 4
possible moves, so the lower bound based on this sort of counting
argument is O(log((N^2)!)) = O(N^2 log N).  Yet we know that we can put
O(N^2) pieces at a distance of O(N) from their home, so God's number
for the puzzle is O(N^3).  It is pleasant to see that our bounds on the
cubes are tight to within a log factor.

HI CUBE-LOVERS, 

PUZZLE AVAILABILITY:

6/17 MACY'S RAN AN AD IN THE NY TIMES FOR 12 PIECE RUBIK'S MAGIC.  The puzzle
has 5 rings that have to be linked and was advertised for $15.

In Japan, associated with the New Zealand mazes are puzzle shops.  These shops
are creating a demand for puzzles.  A co-worker just back from Tokyo purchased
some puzzles at the "MATSUYA" department store in GINZA.  There is a line of
cast puzzles that cost about $7:  KEY, A-B-C, STAR, S&S, HORSESHOES (see slocums
book).  There is also a line of Ring disentanglement puzzles that cost about $6;
 BROKEN HEART, SWING, "U" RING, DEVIL, POT, LOOP, TRIO RING.  Both puzzle lines
are Bronze colored and come nicely gift boxed.

The Future is Puzzling and Cubing is Forever,

    PLANAR POSITIONS OF RUBIK'S MAGIC, THE 8 SQUARE PUZZLE

    by P Beck and D Hoey,  July 1987
       <BECK@ARDEC-LCSS.ARPA> or <PBECK@ARDEC.ARPA>,
       <HOEY@NRL-AIC.ARPA>

This is a catalog of the 96 planar positions of the 8-square Rubik's
Magic puzzle.  The list is based on two rules for positioning the eight
squares.

RULE 1--Placement:  Let the pieces be numbered from 1 to 8.  Any planar
position must consist of squares in the pattern

                ``2x4''       or      ``3x3''

                A B C D                A B C
                H G F E                H E D
                                       G F

where A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H is a cyclical rearrangement of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.
These patterns can also be rotated or reflected.

Both the 2x4 and the 3x3 patterns have eight rotations and reflections,
and there are eight possible assignments of the numbers 1-8 to the
letters A-H.  However, a 180-degree rotation of the 2x4 is equivalent
to a reassignment of the numbers.  So there are only 32 different 2x4
positions, while there are a full 64 of the 3x3 positions.

RULE 2--Orientation:  The pieces fit together as if the four edges
of each unrotated piece were

         +-b-+                                +-d-+
labeled  a O c  for odd-numbered pieces, and  a E c  for even-numbered
         +-d-+                                +-b-+

pieces, and the small letters must match where neighbors abut.

From rule 1, it is apparent that when neighbors abut, one of them must
be an even-numbered piece and the other odd.  From rule 2, we observe
that if a piece is rotated by 0 or 180 degrees, then its top and bottom
neighbors must be rotated the same amount and its left and right neigh-
bors must be rotated 180 degrees differently.  In this catalog, piece 1
will be placed in its unrotated orientation.  Then the orientation of
each piece is determined from its position relative to piece 1, and the
entire position is determined by the choice of pattern under rule 1.

TRANSFORMATION:  Each 2x4 position can be directly transformed into any
of four 3x3 positions, by folding out either end to either side.  Each
of the 3x3's can be directly transformed into either a vertical or a
horizontal 2x4.

SYMBOLOGY:  Plain numbers indicate an unrotated piece, while numbers
followed by an asterisk indicate pieces rotated 180 degrees.

The use of numbers seems to be the most popular alternate graphics
pattern at this time, as it most clearly shows what is happening as the
puzzle is manipulated.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:  Thanks to Rodney Hoffman for reviewing a preliminary
version of the catalog and the inspiration to prepare it in the first
place.

BOOK OF INTEREST

Tilings and Patterns  by Branko Grunbaum and G. C. Shephard
from w. h. Freeman and Co,  1987,    ISBN   0-7167-1193-1
......................
FROM THE PREFACE:   
_______________________________
ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK
------------------------------------
The book falls naturally into two parts.  The first, up to and including Chapter
7, can be used as the text for a geometry course at the undergraduate level -
...   The first few sections of chapter 1 are fundamental, however, chapter 2
deals mostly with tilings in which the tiles are regular polygons.  ...   The
general theory of tilings is presented in chapters 3 and 4, these chapters are
rather more technical than the rest of the book, and ...    In chapter 5 we
begin our discussion of the theory of patterns; this continues in chapter 7. 
...

the second part (chapters 8-12) presents detailed surveys of various aspects of
the subjects of patterns and tilings.  These include colored patterns and groups
of color symmetry, tilings by polygons, tilings in which the tiles are unusual
in a topological sense, as well as, a detailed and self-contained account of the
intriguing topic of aperiodic tilings.  ...

I am interested in information on the "Pastime Puzzles"  (jigsaw puzzles) made
by Parker Brothers in 1932/33/ and other puzzles of similar construction .  The
ones I have were sold by the Kohler Puzzle Exchange, 105 Roseville Ave, Newark
NJ  and if anybody has information on this firm I would also like the reference.

These puzzles are of the type currently being manufactured by "Stave", ie,
many pieces have shapes (eg, numbers, violins, fruits),  false corners and
edges, cuts where the colors change, etc

      Greetings fellow cube lovers,

         I have only learned to solve the cube this summer, and now am working
 on R*bik's Revenge (and Magic) and I was wondering if anyone out there knows
 of any publications dealing with solving them and any dealing with the theory
 behind them - as I have really enjoyed Frey & Singmaster's _Cubik Math_.

         I have tried writing to Ideal Toy Corporation as mention in the Revenge
 product but they seem to have moved - anybody know where they are?


          thanks in advance,

                  Rob

1.  For the collectors, I recently obtained a new to me shape variant of the
2x2x2.  It is a cylinder, mine is half black and half white.  It was made by the
Swiss company NAEF and is called "ROTA".  It is very similar in size to the
standard cube.  It should cost about $15.

2.  Has anybody played a game called "GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES".  It uses the
PYRAMINX in some fashion and I believe it was developed/marketed by MEFFERT.

The October '87 issue of 'Scientific American' is completely devoted to
Advanced Computing, so it is probably of interest to many of us.  In
addition, the 'Amateur Scientist' column in that issue (by Jearle
Walker, pages 170-173) is all about Rubik's Magic (the original, 8-panel
version).  It includes tables and diagrams of permutations, and a
complete solution with pictures.

FOR FUN, JAPAN TURNS TO MAZES

The Sunday NY TImes of 10/11/87 Travel section, pg3 had a small piece on
amusement park mazes.

Some random quotes:

"A lot of people are willing to pay the $3 fee that most of the approximately 20
outdoor mazes charge for the opportunity to become confused."

"The object, ...,  is to get through the maze as fasy as possible.  On average,
it takes 45 minutes to escape or give up."

"each maze has a theme - such as the Paris-Dakar Rally Maze in Tokyo and the
Sherlock Maze in Osaka."

To anyone out there:

I am currently involved in a research project on the Rubik's Cube and expert
solving of it.  The conventional cubes sold in most stores fall apart in the
hands of the expert, because corners catch.  For awhile there were cubes
manufactured that have tiles for colored plates.  We have one of these, but
would like to have some more.  If anyone knows where we may look for these
cubes or has access to these cubes, please notify me.

								Thank you,

By the way, this bboard is very cool!

The cubes to which you refer were manufactured in Korea.

I purchased three or four in Toronto at a Korean trade show about six years
ago,
and still have them in perfect working order.

Sorry I can't give you anymore information than that,
other than to say that they are trully amazing in that they
have lasted extremely well and require absolutely no maintenance.

The red's a little hard to distinguish from the orange
in the wrong light but that is the only problem.

While we are on the subject, does anyone know where to acquire
a 5x5x5?  There was a source in London two years ago but they ran out
and haven't been seen since.

Also I'd like to acquire the globe
on which the equator, greenwich and 90' meridians rotate.

SHAPES THAT ARE IN HARMONY WITH THE ALTERNATE GRAPHICS.  ANYBODY OUT THERE
INVESTIGATE THIS VARIANT OR THE MAGIC GAME?  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY IMPRESSIONS.

Subject:  Deluxe Magic

I picked up a "deluxe Rubik's Magic" at Games People Play the other day.
It is a twelve-square magic.  Has anyone solved this guy yet?  My wife
has been hacking on it some and and has managed to run it from the
starting state (2x6) to the target state (as in the normal Magic, but
moreso), but not enough comprehension of it all yet to get all the
circle pieces in the right places, yet.

It seems to be more fun that the normal magic because if you ignore
the circles you can make a bunch of interesting shapes (the big-hollow-
square was neat to blunder into).

  /Bernie\

ps, a while back someone (pete?) posted a pointer to some magazine (foreign,
maybe?) that had an article about folding a Magic into a cube.  I don't
remember if I've asked this before or not, but... can anyone send me hints
about how the fold-magic-into-a-cube goes?  tnx /b\

You bet!  As a matter of fact the order-6 puzzle is so much more fun 
than the order-4 that I am wondering whether higher orders might be 
even more fun.  In my opinion the order-4 cube was /less/ fun than the 
order-3, and it's a pleasure to see a puzzle where bigger really is
better.

Jenny and I have a conjecture that if a given flat shape is possible,
a flat shape that is derived from the possible one by moving a single
square one step diagonally -- is impossible.  There is probably a parity
argument lurking somewhere that can prove this.

Is a similar puzzle with triangular tiles possible?

Subject:  New "Recreations in Math" editions

Oxford U Press continues to produce entries in their "Recreations in
Mathematics" series.  I got #s 1 & 2 last year I just got vol 4.  I've
never seen vol 3.

To review, #1 was "Mathematical byways ..." by Hugh ApSimon.  I thought
it was BORING, but it did discuss one thing I've never seen: *how* you
set up a problem so it is both interesting and solvable.  He runs
through starting with some idea for a puzzle (something like the
"you put an X foot ladder up against a wall and it just touches a
box that is Y feet on a side, what's inside the box?") and gives the
"composer's problem" related to that topic: how to get the problem set
up.  Interesting, sort of, but overall pretty boring stuff (especially
since they are for the most part old, stuffy, dull problems).

#2: Ins and Outs of Peg Solitaire.  Really quite definitive reference
to the jump-the-pegs-and-leave-one-in-the-middle puzzle.  I can't remember
where, but I've actually seen most of that material before.  Maybe
Mathematics magazine, or JRM.  But in any event, this is a great book
if you're at all interested in this kind of problem.

#3: Rubik's Cubic Compendium, by Rubik, et al.  I've *never* seen this
anywhere.  I'd love to get/have/see a copy.  If any of you have a lead
to this guy, please let me know.

#4 Sliding Piece Puzzles (Hordern).  I just picked this up at the
Harvard Coop today.  Not much theory on either the design or solution
of this kind of puzzle.  Just page after page of example puzzles.  This
is more of a catalog than a math book.  One cute touch: there is a pocket
inside the back cover with push-out paper "shapes"   I guess that there
are enough miscellaneous shapes on the card (about 2"x4") so that you
can piece together a large number of the puzzles described in the
book.  My first impressions are that this book will be a definite
"Ho Hum".

In Bernie's defense, I'll point out that he didn't name his machine
after himself -- it got named after him by the computer center staff,
who were installing workstations faster than we could think of
cute names for them, and adopted a simple, if boring algorithm for
coming up with machine names.

For puzzler's who like to plan ahead...d there will be a "JIGSAW" puzzle
exhibition in the summer of 1988.  It will be at:

Bates College Museum of Art,
Lewiston, Maine 04240 (I think)
May 19-Aug 12 1988.

The guest curator is:

Anne D. Williams

Let's not start any rumors.  Cube-Lovers-Request works just fine.  I added
you to the list three days ago, and I mailed you an acknowledgment at that
time.  Perhaps some mailer between here and there ate my message for lunch,
but I certainly can't help that.  

Cube-Lovers is an extremely low-volume mailing list these days, so the fact
that your mailbox didn't immediately fill with Cube-Lovers mail means
nothing.  (The previous Cube-Lovers mail was sent last December 11th.)

Message-ID:  <8803281554.aa20390@ARDEC-AC4.ARDEC.ARPA>

a puzzle fool's view of plate tectonics
by peter beck   april 1, 1988

what follows is an unfounded speculation of how "magig polyhedra" can be used to
understand the manifistations of plate tectonics.  my imagination was piqued
while manipulating the "megaminx" (a dodecahedron with flat pentagon shaped
faces, marketed in the usa by tomy) because the puzzle locks up when an attempt
is made to turn too many faces simultaneously.  this causes the surface to
distort and when too much force is excerted the puzzle comes apart in an
explosive fashion.  

i, impusively concluded that the geometric principles governing this explosion
are analogous to what happens when the surface plates of the earth are rotated
by the forces behind plate tectonics.  this analogy is useful because it
provides a macro model with physical parity constraints to study plate
tectonics, eg, by helping forecasters tie together observable events around the
world a better understanding of individual events could be obtained.  another
area of study could be the parity constraints on the motion of the plates, ie, 
the directions of plate rotation are constrained by their neighbors, because
each plate does not move independently (see fig. 465.10 in fuller's book
"synergetics").   [it should be noted that other dodecahedron magic polyhedra
may be more appropriate for the study of plate tectonics; ie, the "impossiball"
or 'alexander's star".]

now that my fantasizing is in high gear i will expand my speculation to consider
the engine that drives plate tectonics.  i have decided that if one knew some
physics it could probably be shown that a rotating sphere with a liquid center
would develop 12 local circulations which the surface plates would float on. 
thus, plate tectonics can on a macro scale be reduced to a simple problem of
fluid dynamics and some geometric parity constraints which can be displayed with
magic polyhedra.

the future is puzzling, but cubing is forever !!

In response to Peter Beck's thought-provoking idea about connecting
Rubikoid puzzles to plate tectonics, I have two slight spoilers.

First, plate tectonics involves spreading zones, which are places where
new crust is created, and subduction zones, where crust is destroyed.
In any permutation group, the things being permuted are not allowed to
appear or disappear.  So it seems unlikely that group theory can be
directly applied to tectonics.

Second, just because a puzzle is Rubikoid does not mean it has parity
constraints.  Consider the "Magic Octohedron", which has eight
triangular faces.  You can grab any pyramidal cluster of four faces and
rotate it.  This is really the 2x2x2 Cube in disguise.  In this form, it
has no parity constraints, that is, all the 8-factorial different
configurations are achievable.  So even if group theory could be applied
to tectonics, we couldn't assume parity constraints in the general case.

I VISITED BY "KAY-BEE" toy store at the mall today.  


REPEAT:  For those of you who like 3-d assembly puzzles a set of 2 GEO-LOGIC
(TAURUS&CETUS) puzzles for $7 .   These puzzles are plastic, and were designed
by Stuart Coffin and manufactured by Skor-Mor (OUT OF BUSINESS).   The full
collection of these puzzzles is called the GEO-LOGIC series.  They are each made
of 6 identical pieces (different for each puzzle) that can be assemblied into an
interlocking self supporting solid.   These puzzles are hard to find.   So if
you may be interested don't delay - call up your KAY BEE now.

NEW FOR 1988
  GRIPPLE as seen on TV for $10.  This is a sequential movement puzzle more
similar to missing link then the cube.

  YOSHI'S (shortening of designers name) PUZZLE for $12 from Parker Bros.  This
is a re-release of a formerly unbranded item, circa 1982 called miraculous cube.
 It is composed of a loop of tetrahedrons taped together to form hinges.   Yoshi
designed/invented two puzzles like this. The other is called the Shisei Mystery
and it works like a Rubik's magic with depth.

  Mattel has a cube puzzle made up of magnetic cubies called "Magic Force" 
I think.  not at kay-bee.

-->   CUBE  MUSEUM  <--

On April 29, 1988 a museum devoted to Rubik's cube opened in  Grand Junction,
CO.   The museum is run by  Cecil Smith and is located in his home at 329 Ouray
Ave;  245-6734.

Cecil is primarily a documentor of pretty patterns and has 4,900 cubes in his
collection.  SO when in Grand Junction don't miss this one of a kind museum.  If
you know of or have something that should be in this museum please contact
Cecil.

Hi CUBE-LOVERS,

I am a "collector" of Rubik's cubes and other magic polyhedra.  As a
collector I am not only interested in the puzzles themselves but also
in the literature about them, the packaging of them and the
merchandise/events that traded on the popularity of the cube.    Below
is a crude taxonomy with  items I have identified.  I would appreciate
criticism of the taxonomy and additions to the specific items . 
 Also, if anybody has or knows where to obtain any items of this genre
please let me know.   Since I am not personally a collector of most
books, articles or solution algorithms about the cube (Bandelow, Helm,
Singmaster, et al are doing that) please do not provide citations
unless they are especially noteworthy.

I only knew about 0.4 (of course) and 0.5 (mentioned for instance in
Singmaster's Notes). Could anyone inform me about 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 please.
Are they the normal 3x3x3-cube, or not?

CUBE PATENTS:

The best overall discussion of cube patents is in Metamagical
Themas,pg 356; D Hofstadter.  Hofstadter says "that the real reason
the Rubik-Ishige Cube took off was that it could be manufactured and
that it did hold together".   In Puzzles Old and New,
Slocum&Boetermans it is stated that the courts gave the US patent
rights to Nichol's.   The is a further discussion of Rotary Puzzle
patents in Doug Engel's self published book "Circle Puzzler's Manual".

If anybody has further patent details please send me citations or even
rumors.  Of especial interest is information on the granting of the US
rights to Nichol's.

I've added some more details to the patent section.

HI CUBE-LOVERS, 

If you enjoyed Rubik's magic you might enjoy "BETCHA CAN'T!, FLEXIBLE HEXAGON"
 This puzzle is constructed like magic, ie, with panels jointed by nylon fishi
line.  It is made up of 6 hexagon panels that are jointed on 2 edges.  The
panels can be manipulated from a hexagon (6 panels around a hexagon hole) to a
2x3 grid.  I didn't buy mine but the price label looks like it was from Toys R

  So you figured out Rubik's Cube, eh?  Well, get ready for
  Rubik's Clock -- a puzzle the Hungarian professor says he 
  hasn't even solved yet, a spokeswoman for the toy company
  marketing the product said Monday.  But Erno Rubik's failure
  has not arisen from a lack of ability, merely a lack of time
  to puzzle out the secrets of Rubik's Clock, said Melanie 
  Bateman of Matchbox Toys Ltd.  "Really, it's not because it's
  impossible, he's just too busy to take the time to do it,"
  she said, adding that the new toy will be launched at a major
  London toy store on Saturday.  What can you expect to pay for
  more hours of mental anguish?  About $12, Bateman said.

Recently, I posted (twice -- sorry!) a short note from the 'Los Angeles Times'
about Rubik's Clock.  Another paper had just a little more information.  From
the 'Los Angeles Herald Examiner', July 26, 1988:


                      RUBIK'S PUZZLING NEW TWIST
		      
    Father of cube craze offers clock toy for those with time on their hands
    
    
    LONDON (AP) - The Hungarian professor [pictured] who frustrated 
    millions with his Rubik's Cube is introducing his latest mind-twister 
    -- a puzzle he says even he hasn't solved, a spokeswoman for the toy 
    company marketing the product said yesterday.
    
    But Erno Rubik's failure has not arisen from a lack of ability, 
    merely a lack of time to puzzle out the secrets of Rubik's Clock, 
    said Melanie Bateman of Matchbox Toys Ltd.  "Really, it's not because 
    it's impossible, he's just too busy to take the time to do it," she said, 
    adding that the new toy will be launched at a major London toy store on
    Saturday.
    
    Rubik's latest brain-teasing toy requires a player to get 18 clocks 
    on both sides of a plastic disc to strike midnight simultaneously by 
    twisting wheels that turn some of the hands but not others, said Bateman.
    
    Speaking of his latest invention, Rubik warned in a press release:  
    "Don't cheat by being taught how to do it by someone else.  It is 
    much more satisfying to decode the puzzle on your own."
    
    "It is important to remember that your brain needs to be kept in shape 
    ... My new puzzle can help because it enables you to focus entirely on 
    finding the formula which, although it may seem frustrating at the time, 
    will do you good," he added.
    
    Rubik's Clock will retain for about $12, Bateman said.
    
    Rubik, 44, a professor of architecture and design at the Academy of Arts 
    and Crafts in Budapest, invented the multicolored Rubik's Cube as a 
    teaching aid.
    
    After the success of the cube, which sold more than 120 million units 
    worldwide, he founded a private business, Rubik's Studio, in conjunction 
    with the Hungarian government.

There are interlocking devices that make the puzzle a "SLIDING BLOCK"
sequential motion puzzle.
    
The puzzle is on sale now in the UK and probably will not see US or
europe distribution for Xmas 1988.

There are solution book already in print.

Christoph Bandelow tells me that the puzzle is not particular
challenging and that he does not expect it to be a great success.

Subject: Force Field
To: cube-lovers@ai.ai.mit.edu
Message-ID: <12474493626.38.AI.CLIVE@MCC.COM>

I acquired a cube puzzle called Force Field a few weeks
ago which I don't recall having seen discussed on this
list.  It's called Force Field (by Mattel), and it consists
of 8 cubies, each measuring about 1" on a side, and each
solid black.  The idea is to arrange these 8 cubies into
a 2x2x2 cube.  This sounds and looks trivial, until you
learn that there are magnets attached to some (but not all)
of the inner surfaces of the cubies.  This means that 
the sides of two cubies may:

	a) repel each other
	b) attract each other but jog off-center (since
	    the magnets are not necessarily at the center of the side)
	c) neither attract nor repel each other (if magnets
	   don't exist on both of the sides involved)
	d) attract each other and stay perfectly aligned

The final 2x2x2 cube has to hold together perfectly, without one
or more of the cubies popping out.  Furthermore, it is not enough
to juxtapose the sides with no magnets, since the final cube has
to be placed in a special stand which balances it on one of
its corners.  This is the acid test-- the cube might look ok when
resting on the table, but in order to survive in the stand, all
internal sides must actively attract each other with perfect
alignment.

I finally had to resort to temporary labels on the cubies in order
to systematically search for a solution.  One of the first things
you learn is that each cubie has 3 magnets, precisely the number
required.  This cuts down the search space tremendously: since the
3 sides with magnets must be internal, this constrains a particular 
corner of each cubie be at the center of the large cube.  But it
still involves over 33 million possible positions (3^8)*(7!).

I'd be interested to hear if any of you folks have played with this,
and if anybody has developed a procedure for putting the cube together
which does not involve labeling, which is what I'm working on now.

Happy cubing,

Clive

Subject: Impossible object puzzle

A "former friend" of a "former friend" passed on to me a puzzle which
appears to be impossible to solve. I do not know its name nor who
makes it. It is also hard to describe but here goes: It is a clear box
about (1.5")^3. Inside are three (3/4) yellow planes which intersect
in the center of the box and extend to the sides.
____
| x |
|   -----    
|    0  |
|_______|

Here is a picture of the 3/4 plane. The "x" and "0" are holes which
will be explained. The box contains three identical blue objects which
look like half dumbbells. They will fit through the "0" hole but only
the shaft will fit into the "x" hole. The puzzle is to insert each of
the three shafts into each of the three "x" holes.

It is easy to get one in and I once got two in. But to get all three
in simultaneously seems impossible. Does anyone know whether this
puzzle can be solved and add more info on who makes it, etc?

CUBING is back??

I here from europe (the Nuremberg Toy fair) that Rubik's Cube is back
as the 'MATCHBOX CUBE" (Rubik's is associated with Matchbox Toys).  I
presume that Ideal toy owns the trademark to Rubik's cube but not the
patent.  

The cubes displayed are standard 3x3x3 cubes with Rubik's signature
and silhouette on the center cubie (center moves will now be
required).

Anybody out there know anything more about this?

I took some time off this week and began playing with the cube to
teach one of my kids how to solve it. I had not tried for perhaps 5
years. To my surprise I had forgotten a few transformations while
recalling a few which are "equally difficult". It took about 10 hours
to get back to the stage where I can solve it in about 3 minutes
except for the flip of two opposite edges. I recall that we discussed,
in this forum, a nice procedure for this move many years ago and I
wonder whether anyone recalls it.

Also, to what extent have others shared my experience of forgetting
moves?

    I took some time off this week and began playing with the cube to
    teach one of my kids how to solve it. I had not tried for perhaps 5
    years. To my surprise I had forgotten a few transformations while
    recalling a few which are "equally difficult". It took about 10 hours
    to get back to the stage where I can solve it in about 3 minutes
    except for the flip of two opposite edges. I recall that we discussed,
    in this forum, a nice procedure for this move many years ago and I
    wonder whether anyone recalls it.

Recall the "Extended Befuddler" language:

B, F, U, D, L, R are counter-clockwise quarter twists.
Lower-case are clockwise.

I, i, J, j, K, k are whole-cule rotations agreeing in sense and axis
with B, F, U, D, L, R, in that order.

We group together sequences that are order-independent.  These sequences
almost always correspond to intuitive "moves".

And now, to flip the FD and BU edges:

;;; First monoflip:
f	; Get FD edge into equator.
jUd	; Slice it to the back.
FF	; Turn the vacated slot over
JuDJuD	; and slice the cubie back into the inverted slot.
F	; Move the cubie to the top.
;;; Segue
UU	; Exchange it with the other edge to be flipped.
;;; Second monoflip:
f	; Move the new edge into the equator,
JuDJuD	; slice it to the back the long way,
FF	; turn the vacated slot over,
JuD	; and slice the cubie back into the inverted slot, the short way.
f	; Get it back to the top
;;; Coda
UU	; Un-segue 
FF	; and take first edge back to the bottom.
;;; Checksum of whole-cube moves: jJJJJJ = 1.
;;; 26 qtw, 13 "moves" including half-twists and slices.

I doubt if this is minimal, but it is so intuitive that I was able to
type this sequence without a cube in my hands.

    Also, to what extent have others shared my experience of forgetting
    moves?

Some.

Are there any patent engineers out there?

Patent 4,872,682 by Kuchimanchi (U of Maryland PHD student) and Thekur
(UC santa cruz PHD student) is for a new cube puzzle.

From the NY Times 10/14/89 Patents column:

"... ,the new brain teaser is a cube divided into squares, nine on
each face.  Each square can be rotated in both a horizontal and
vertical plane, creating billions of possible combinations.  at the
outset, all squares on each side have the same color.  the goal is to
mix up the colors and get them back in order.

In addition, however, the new puzzle contains one blank square, which
can be slid to any location on the cube. This makes the challenge
easier, because it gives the players another way to move squares from
one place to another."

So what do you think this puzzle is?  Do cubies rotate or do cubie
faces rotate?  Is this a sliding block puzzle on the equators like the
hungarian globe puzzle as sold by nature company etal?  Is this just
sam lloyd 15 puzzle on the surface of a cube?

    Are there any patent engineers out there?

The following is a public service announcement -- everybody ought to
know this.

    Patent 4,872,682 by Kuchimanchi (U of Maryland PHD student) and Thekur
    (UC santa cruz PHD student) is for a new cube puzzle.

Whenever you know a patent number, you can obtain a complete copy of the
patent by writing to:

Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks
Washington, DC 20231
Attention: Patent orders

Include the patent number and a check for $1.50.  Used to be you could
get the patent back in ten days.  Lately the delay is more like four
weeks.

    From the NY Times 10/14/89 Patents column:

    "... ,the new brain teaser is a cube divided into squares, nine on
    each face.  Each square can be rotated in both a horizontal and
    vertical plane, creating billions of possible combinations.  at the
    outset, all squares on each side have the same color.  the goal is to
    mix up the colors and get them back in order.

    In addition, however, the new puzzle contains one blank square, which
    can be slid to any location on the cube. This makes the challenge
    easier, because it gives the players another way to move squares from
    one place to another."

    So what do you think this puzzle is?  Do cubies rotate or do cubie
    faces rotate?  Is this a sliding block puzzle on the equators like the
    hungarian globe puzzle as sold by nature company etal?  Is this just
    sam lloyd 15 puzzle on the surface of a cube?

All these questions will be answered by the complete patent.

If you are more impatient, call the local government printing office,
and ask them where the patent depository for your area is.  Access to
patent depositories is free, although the depository (usually a public
library) can charge a fee for printing.  The librarian at the depository
can tell you how to look up the patent.  Usually it is on microfilm or
fiche.

Warning: if you are like me, you will find the patent depository
addicting.  Stay away if you have family resposibilities.  Above all,
avoid learning the seductively simple cross-reference scheme or you will
spend the rest of your life browsing through puzzle patents!

Stu Coffin, internationally known puzzle designer, will be speaking
to the Philomorphs (form-lovers) Society at Harvard next Monday
Dec 4 at 7:45 pm (Carpernter Center, Studio 2 west).
He will be talking about his new book, :The Puzzling World of
Polyhedral Dissections", and about his bizarre and clvere puzzle
designs in general. Better yet, there will probably be examples of his
work to puzzle around with. Stu's puzzles are just amazing; they combine
an amazing intuition for geometric structure with excellent craftsmanship;
they aree really worth seeing if you like puzzles, geometry, or just
nifty design and execution. See you there!!

Peter, 

    I'm still interested in seeing the CFF table of contents, though I
might be subscribing to it, because you write

    RUBIK'S CUBE IN 44 MOVES:  HANS KLOOSTERMAN

Does that article actually show how to solve the cube in 44 moves?
Even if they count half-turns as single moves, it is significantly
better than the 52-move Thistlethwaite solution in Singmaster.  Also,
Thistlethwaite was thinking of improving his method, and perhaps this
is a report of it.  Or maybe it's just more rumor and conjecture, but
it's nice to hear after all this time.

I was making a few patterns over the weekend for some kids, and thought
of some stuff I was thinking of trying out.  For instance, if you
restrict a face to two colors, there are only about fifty different
patterns, at least if you ignore handedness.  I wonder how many of them
can be put on every face of the cube.  We know the ones with corners
alternating colors are impossible.  We have some experience with some
of the patterns--the X's, Crosses, Spots, T's, and H's--but that still
leaves a large number of possibilities.

My Christmas present to myself this year was to order Rubik's Cubic
Compendium.  I hope to be able to report on that sometime soon.  It's
always possible we may have a Cubic renaissance, though I'm not holding
my breath.

Dan

pbeck>   RUBIK'S CUBE IN 44 MOVES:  HANS KLOOSTERMAN

I guess that's on an algorithm to always solve the cube in at most 44
moves. Is that right? Is that the best known algorithm (best = has
minimum maximum number of moves)? Singmaster gives a broad outline of
Thistlethwaite's algorithm in his "Notes on Rubik's 'Magic Cube'".
That algorithm would always solve it in 52 moves, and I know that has
been improved to 50 moves. Is this new algorithm something like
Thistlethwaite's algorithm or is it working in a different way?

<<Attention Directors, Managers, Analysts, Consultants, Programmers,
<<Technical Writers, Trainers, and Librarians!
<< 
<<The higher education computing scene in the 1990s will present exciting
<<challenges.  To accommodate users' needs, computing service organizations
<<are now visibly transforming in function and structure.  The widespread
<<adoption of personal computing by all disciplines, the increasing demand
<<for desktop access to shared resources, the growth in demand for
<<supercomputing capabilities, and the proliferation of powerful desktop
<<workstations exert irresistible forces on central computing services.
<<In response, the central site grows exponentially in staff and machinery
<<at one academic institution; at another, the computing center is disbanded
<<to provide distributed computing!  At some sites increasing specialization
<<is urged; at others, generalization is required.  Regardless of the
<<transforming strategy adopted by an individual institution, one fact
<<seems clear:  the user is the center toward which all computing services
<<are directed.
<< 
<<SIGUCCS '90 invites you to participate in the examination and discussion
<<of the myriad challenges facing user services professionals as we enter a
<<new decade and of the new centerings computing service organizations are
<<discovering to meet them.  Please join us!

<< 
<<Presentation Topic Areas
<< 
<< 
<<Information Exchange Technology
<< 
<<Information exchange may well be the most important computing
<<activity of the 1990s. The infrastructure for information delivery, the
<<National Research and Academic Network (NREN), is presently being developed.
<<How do we meet the challenges of a world where the
<<facilitation of information delivery may be a principal user services
<<responsibility?  Topics of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	new approaches to information exchange
<< 
<<	campus activity in implementing information exchange
<<	facilities that comply with emerging international standards
<< 
<<	research and development of computer-mediated information
<<	exchange methods
<< 
<< 
<<Distributed Services
<< 
<<As the role of user services shifts to providing distributed support,
<<we must create new ways of providing traditional services as well as
<<designing new services.  Topics of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	providing support staff in departments and colleges
<< 
<<	funding issues
<< 
<<	if and how to charge back for services
<< 
<<	human networking of distributed support staff
<< 
<<	nonlabor-intensive support strategies
<< 
<<	cooperative efforts with other departments
<< 
<< 
<< 
<<Management Strategies
<< 
<<How do user services managers cooperate with other administrative and
<<academic units that use or provide computing resources?  How do they
<<meet the many and diverse demands?  Topics of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	reorganization
<< 
<<	interaction with faculty advisory groups
<< 
<<	delegating and distributing responsibility
<< 
<<	coordinating university computing resources
<< 
<<	staff professional development
<< 
<< 
<<Marketing your Services
<< 
<<Changing roles may require changing your services and, often, your image on
<<campus as you provide new services to new users.  Topics of particular in-
<<terest include:
<< 
<<	promotional strategies
<< 
<<	conducting market research
<< 
<<	designing services for unique or special audiences
<< 
<< 
<< 
<<Strategies for Small Schools
<< 
<<How can a small liberal arts college have distributed user services and
<<centralized user services?  How do distributed and centralized services work
<<together to provide computing services beyond word processing?  The
<<sciences have become computer literate; now, how do we reach out  from the
<<center to the humanities and fine arts?  Are we getting out of the
<<office and into the trenches?  Are we making too many "house calls"?
<<Should we make them at all?
<< 
<< 
<<Security and Ethics
<< 
<<As electronic mail and conferencing become more popular, computing
<<systems are widely accessible to more users.  How secure should academic
<<computing resources be?  What are the ethical guidelines provided for users
<<of electronic mail and conferencing systems?  Topics of particular interest
<<include:
<< 
<<	promoting responsible and ethical use of computing resources
<< 
<<	security strategies
<< 
<<	adopting an ethics policy
<< 
<< 
<<Serving New Audiences
<< 
<<People from the humanities, the arts, and other traditionally nontechnical
<<disciplines are discovering that computers can help in areas other than
<<word processing.  In an increasingly proactive stance in the central
<<computing facility, what do we do to attract and support these new audi-
<<ences?  Topics of interest include:
<< 
<<	providing information about off-the-shelf specialized
<<	programs for music, fine arts, and the humanities
<< 
<<	facilitating technical support of nontraditional areas
<< 
<<	serving the computing beginner who wants to do
<<	sophisticated tasks
<< 
<< 
<<Consulting, Training, and Documentation
<< 
<<Supporting those who use the computing resources that we provide re-
<<mains an important responsibility of user services organizations.  Topics
<<of particular interest include:
<< 
<<	new approaches to training
<< 
<<	providing distributed consulting
<< 
<<	documentation distribution services
<< 
<< 
<<and/or other topics that would be of interest to your national
<<and international colleagues

..........................................................

PUZZLES OLD AND NEW:  Head Crackers, Patience Provers, and Other
Tactile
Teasers  [including more variations on Rubik's cube than I've ever
seen before]

Accompanied by the book PUZZLES OLD AND NEW: HOW TO MAKE AND SOLVE
THEM  by Jerry Slocum and Jack Botermans ($20), [wash univ press,
available from slocum or myself.  The reprint of the HOFFMAN book is
also available now from slocum, about $35.]
 The exhibit discusses
        The Art in Puzzles
        The Social Experience
        Cultural Values
        Puzzles in the Industrial Age
        Puzzles in Education
        Puzzles and Science
 It aims "to explore the history, meanings, and design of mechanical
puzzles."  The extensive displays categorize puzzles according to
their
object:
        Put-Together Puzzles
        Take-Apart Puzzles
        Interlocking Solid Puzzles
        Disentanglement Puzzles
        Sequential Movement Puzzles
        Puzzle Vessels
        Dexterity Puzzles
        Vanish Puzzles
        Impossible Object Puzzles
        Folding Puzzles
Puzzles have been lent by collectors and museums around the world.
 The
exhibit consultants are Benjamin Kilborne and Martin Gardner.
 
There are hands-on puzzles, but too simple and too few.  It's a
wonderful and tantalizing display of puzzles.  I was SOOO frustrated
not
to be able to handle all the beautiful, enticing pieces.  Of course,
if
I had been permitted to, I would never leave....

Subject: Language in Rubik's Cubic Compendium

Well, my order of Rubik's Cubic Compendium came through.  I ordered it
through Reiter's (The DC technical bookstore) and paid $30 for it.
It's basically six largely independent chapters translated from
Hungarian, with foreword and afterword by Singmaster and a
bibliography.  There's definitely some neat stuff there.

My favorite piece of the book is in Tamas Varga's ``The Art of
Cubing'', which develops some interesting new additions to what we
used to call ``Rubiksong'', the language we use to describe processes.
He starts by renaming the Up face to be the Top, the advantage of
which is to make all the face names consonants.  He then uses vowels
to indicate the direction of turn, "O" for 90 degrees fOrward (or
clOckwise), "A" for 90 degrees bAckward (or Anticlockwise) and "I" for
a 180 degree half-turn (twIce).  This works out neatly to allow a
process to be described with a syllable for each quarter- or
half-turn.  So Pons Asinorum can be done with FIBITIDIRILI and
Laughter is 3 FOBOROLOs.

But wait, there's more!  Remember how Befuddler never was able to
handle whole-cube moves neatly?  In this notation, you append a "C" to
a syllable to indicate that instead of turning the face, you turn the
whole cube.  So the way I usually do Laughter is really 6 ROLOTOCs.
This notation is not as parsimonious, since FOC=BAC, TOC=DAC, and
ROC=LAC, but it's better than having to stop in the middle and say
``then move the cube''.  For instance, Jim Saxe's 28-qt Plummer's
Cross can be done as "FOLIRIFO BOLIRIFO ROFIBIRO LOFIBIRO TIDI", but
the way he originally described it (3 Dec 1980 00:50) was "FOLIRIFO
BOLIRIFO TOC FOLIRIFO BOLIRIFO TIDI", but instead of TOC he had a
couple of lines of text.

He also has a way of talking about the slice moves, where you move
the middle layer of the cube instead of the faces.  For moving the
middle, you append "M" to the syllable.  So the way most people do a
Spratt wrench is 4 TOROMs, and we can do the Plummer's Cross as
FOLIMBO FOLIMFO TOC FOLIMBO FOLIMFO TIM.  Of course, ROM=LAM, etc.
(This could also work for Rubik's revenge, where ROM and LAM are
different, being moves of the inner layers adjacent to the R and L
faces).

It's unfortunate that he doesn't extend the language past the point of
appending "M" and "C".  I would like to have a way of talking about
slice moves where you move the faces rather than the middle.  Of
course, we could say ROLA, but I'd rather say something like ROS.
This might interfere with the use of "s" for plurals (as they do in
the book and I do above), but that could be fixed by pronouncing the
pluralizing s as "z".

Another idea is to append "N" to syllables for aNtislice moves.  So
Laughter would be six RONTOCs.  I'm a little concerned though, that "M"
and "N" might be difficult to distinguish.

Another suggestion is to append "P" to allow "deeP" moves, where we do
RO and ROM simultaneously by grabbing two layers of the cube and
turning them while keeping the remaining face fixed.

It might be nice to use "G" to denote the way we "Wring" the cube,
as with ROPRO.  So 6 ROGTOC's does an 8-Flip.

To summarize,

    F,B,T,D,R,L -- faces Front, Back, Top, Down, Right, Left.
    O,A,I       -- directions fOrward, bAckward, twIce.
    C,M,S,N,P,G -- extensions whole-Cube, Middle, Slice, aNtislice,
		    deeP, wrinG

All extensions but C are redundant, since

        ROM=ROCRALO
        ROS=ROLO
        RON=ROLA
        ROP=ROCLA
        ROG=ROCROLO

I'm going over their list of pretty patterns, and hopefully I can find
out which ones are improvements.  I did notice they don't have Saxe's
Plummer's cross process.
