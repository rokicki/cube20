I find it most convienent to think of this situation as the following:

One of the "center-slices" containing one of the "swapped" edge pieces is
rotated by 90 degrees.

(This is roughly analogous to the the 3X case where the whole cube is
solved except for two corners and two edge pieces being --respectively--
swapped.  The problem is that the unfinished face is 90dg out of phase.)

Rotate that center-slice by 90 degrees and re-solve from there.

This is surely not the most efficient (i.e. shortest) solution; but it is
conceptually straight forward.
