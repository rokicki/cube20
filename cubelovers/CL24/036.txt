I absolutely agree with your reasoning. A quarter turn of a central
slice must be at the heart of any procedure to perform an edge swap,
because it is the only way to change the parity of the edges.  That was
what I said in my first post on 1 October 1997.

In my second post I was trying to look at the effect of that quarter
turn of the central slice on the centre pieces, and show that, as they
had been subjected to an even permutation by reason of the centre-slice
turn, the centre pieces could not have undergone an invisible swap of a
single pair of centre pieces.  Having made a single quarter turn of the
central slice, all the other edge and centre pieces can be restored
with processes of even parity, like your two 3-cycles.
