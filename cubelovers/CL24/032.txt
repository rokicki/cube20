I'm tempted to try a little more analysis of the parity constraints on
the 4x4x4 cube, though no doubt it's all been done before.  As der
Mouse said,

A slice turn produces a 4-cycle on the edges and two 4-cycles on the
face centres; a face turn produces a 4-cycle on the face centres and
two 4-cycles on the edges (and a 4-cycle on the corners, which may or
may not be relevant).

I think it is very relevant. We can set the effects out as follows:

Turn		Piece		Cycle(s)	Parity
------          -------         --------        -------

Slice		edge		1x4		odd
		centre		2x4		even

Face		edge		2x4		even
		centre		1x4		odd
		corner		1x4		odd

The consequence is that the parity of the centre pieces depends
entirely on the number of face turns - any slice turns do not affect
the parity of these pieces since the changes they introduce will be of
even parity.  For face turns, the changes to the parity of the corner
pieces and the centre pieces are the same.  Hence if the corner pieces
are in place, the centres will be in an even permutation, and that will
not be changed even if the edge pieces are in an odd permutation, which
was the essence of Clive McCaig's original question. Nor will that be
changed by any turn of a central slice to bring them back to an even
permutation.

I the corners are correct (which I guess is the normal situation when
the problem with the swapped edge pieces shows up) then, though I say
so with some hesitation, I do not think Jerry Bryan is right in saying
that the pair of swapped edge pieces will be matched by a pair of
swapped centre pieces.  For example, the process I quoted switches edge
pieces, and though it has no visible effect on the centre pieces, it
does in fact change the positions of the centre pieces on the front
face (if I have correctly identified the results of a bit of hasty work
with little Post-it stickers).  However, the whole block of four
rotates through 180 degrees, which is two 2-cycles and thus of even
parity.  Edwin Saesen could mark the centre pieces, get them back to
their original position and still find the edge pieces swapped, but
that will not prevent his correcting the edge pieces, and then, if he
wants to, correcting the centre pieces with even-parity processes.

Luckily, for the 4x4x4, we do not have to worry about twists for the
edge pieces or the centre pieces, since that is fixed geometrically for
each position they can occupy.  When an edge piece is in its home
position it must be the right way round.  When it moves to its
next-door position it must flip.  I imagine this is the point behind
Allan Wechsler's charming square-dancing analogy.  The centre pieces
always present the same corner to the central intersection of the face.
