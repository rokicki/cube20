I just got one of these for christmas and had a question or two.  First is
there a cube program so I can play with it and not destroy all the work I
have done?  And I have solved one side, and all of the edges without much
problems.  However, can I solve the middle pieces without destroying the
edges?  As of yet I haven't found a way to keep the one side I have
finished and move one of the center pieces on another side.  I don't want
moves, I just want to know if it is possible to solve this way or if I
need to start looking at another way to solve it.
