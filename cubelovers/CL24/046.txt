Subject: Maximality Analysis Through 11q
To: cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu
Message-Id: <Pine.WNT.3.96.971007165003.-773443A-100000@GN209A.PSTCC.CC.TN.US>

Not too long ago, I reported that my Shamir program had completed
searching through 11q from Start, that the results did confirm my
previous results using tape spinning programs, that no local maxima were
found 11q from Start, and that otherwise nothing new was found.  I have
come to realize that there is a small bit of new information.  I really
should post the maximality analysis in its entirety, because the whole
row 11q from Start is new.  The row 11q from Start does include the
failure to find any new local maxima.  As always, the local maxima are
in the right-most column, where all 12 moves go closer to Start.
