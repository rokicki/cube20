Subject: 6x6x6 cube design
Message-Id: <19971113.100159.5094.0.tenie1@juno.com>
From: tenie1@juno.com (Tenie Remmel)

I am attempting to design a 6x6x6 cube.  My idea to make it structurally
sound is to attach both the center cubies and the middle edge cubies to
a ball in the center.  Then all other pieces are wedged behind those.  I
think that extending from the 5x5x5 design the same way the 4x4x4 was
extended from the 3x3x3 design would be way too flimsy, mainly because
the centers would have to be attached via long, thin struts which are
apt to break easily unless made out of metal, which would make the thing
way too heavy.  The width of the cubies probably could not be more than
14 or 15 mm; if they were larger, the cube would be quite big and so it
would be difficult to manipulate.

Unfortunately the ball would be quite complicated, with six or even nine
tracks in it instead of just three as in the 4x4x4 cube.  It might have
to be made of metal instead of plastic (it shouldn't be too heavy if it
is hollow).  Also the 152 pieces will be a real pain to put together...

Of course, even if it can be built, does anyone know how to solve it?

Here is a rather crude diagram of a cross section through the center of
the cube.  Actually it is just a quarter of a cube.

BTW, Does anyone have experience with TurboCAD?  Can it be used to
design this type of thing?  It sure would be easier to use a computer
program than to use graph paper.

I believe that the 6x6x6 is the largest mechanically possible, because
with the 7x7x7 and higher cubes, the corner cubies aren't attached to
anything at all!  Is this correct?

Also what is the mechanism for a 2x2x2 cube?  Could it be extended to
make a more stable 4x4x4 and/or 6x6x6 cubes...

And how about a GigaMinx, a 5x5 version of the MegaMinx magic pentagonal
dodecahedron, with five pieces on each edge, 31 pieces on each face
(5 corners, 11 edges and 11 central pieces), 242 pieces total.  I would
draw a diagram if it wasn't so hard to make a pentagon out of chars...

[ Moderator's note:  The purported impossibility of a Rubik's 7^3 has been
  discussed and refuted repeatedly on this list, and several mechanisms
  have been proposed for it; see the archives.  It is not true that the
  corner cubies "aren't attached to anything".  Each corner will be attached
  to at least two edge cubies, though not always the same two edge cubies.
  You should also look in the archives to find descriptions of the 2^3, some
  as recently as 28 July.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to understand
  it.  I'd like to see a clear description, as I haven't got a 2^3 handy to
  try myself.  -Dan ]
