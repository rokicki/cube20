Subject: save a cube for the price of a stamp

My trusty 4x4x4 has died.  I urgently need 2 replacement "1-sided"
cubelets, preferably white and yellow.  I'm hoping someone has a
similarly defunct 4x4x4 that they saved for sentimental reasons (or to
admire the amazing internal mechanism) and will send me some spare
parts.
