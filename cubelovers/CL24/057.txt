Sure...but who picks the specific instances for them?

This means that the solving program has to imagine macros, try to
choose a useful one, determine whether it's actually possible (you
gotta keep the program from trying to produce, for example, a single
edge flipper).  You also have to decide when it's worth trying for a
macro and when it's better to just hit the (sub)problem with brute
force.  I would expect all these problems to be quite hard.

I'll send off a missive to the author.
