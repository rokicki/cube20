Subject: a Rubiks Xmas

not only did I get 24 new cubes (as a gift to fill out my
gameroom window which now holds 120 cubes poised
and ready for new cube art) but my 9 year old niece
brought me a cube to mix up...  which she then solved!

anyone know any kids younger than 9 that can solve the
cube?  I'm sure there are younger cubists out there...  but
I sure was impressed.
