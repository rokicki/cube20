This confirms a common (european?) prejudice about the U.S. and their
tendency to file lawsuits over just about anything.
I feel certain Rubik himself would have nothing against Byrden's
online cube. On the other hand it's good to know his business is well
taken care of...
Don't know about the 4x4x4 copyright, but it's pretty well known Rubik
did not design the actual mechanism for it. Ideal just used his name
to market the puzzle.

By the way, I did visit the www.Byrden.com site some time ago and really
liked it, not the least the "special octahedron".
