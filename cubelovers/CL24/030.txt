Subject: My Revenge is Complete

How strange that I both have a broken Rubik's Revenge and need a piece
to an Alexander's Star.  What are the odds?

I haven't looked at it for quite some time, but I think my Revenge is
complete.  The problem is the ball in the center.  One of the corners
is broken (if you have seen a dissasmbled RR it makes sense for a ball
to have corners) and has resisted all attempts at being glued.  So it
may be that my broken cube will not be of any help to Darin Haines, but
the rest of the cubies are intact if anyone needs any of them.  Which
brings up that I have a fairly large collection of broken or otherwise
incomplete puzzles.  I suspect that this is true for many of us. I would
be more than willing to do some trading if anyone has any particular
needs.  Let me know.
