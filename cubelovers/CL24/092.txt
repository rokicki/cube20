Subject: Rubiks Revenge moves
Message-Id: <19971118.204255.7126.1.tenie1@juno.com>
From: tenie1@juno.com (Tenie Remmel)

Is there an easy way to cycle three adjacent top edges on the
Rubiks Revenge?  I can't find one shorter than 62 moves, but if
there was a short one I could simplify my solution greatly.

. b c .    . a b .
a . . . => c . . .
. . . .    . . . .
. . . .    . . . .

Hopefully it won't mess up the corners, but it's ok if it does.

I'd also like to see some short moves for the following 3-cycles:

. * * .    . . * .    . . . .    . . * .
. . . .    * . . *    * . . *    . . . *
* . . .    . . . .    . . . *    * . . .
. . . .    . . . .    . . . .    . . . .

Is there a good source anywhere for moves, pretty patterns, etc. for
the Rubiks Revenge?  It's quite difficult to find information about
it.  Also is there an automatic move generating program for the higher
order cubes like 'Cube Explorer' is for the 3x3x3?
