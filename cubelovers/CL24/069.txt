Subject: A 4 Dimensional Rubik's Cube

About 18 months ago I sent this group an email about a Mac based program I
have written that simulates a 4 dimensional (3x3x3x3) Rubik's Cube based on
an unpublished paper by Harry Kamack and Tom Keene.

Some of you who were interested in the paper that describes the model and
the program had difficulty with the copies I sent you and, I suspect, were
unable to read it after you received it. Someone suggested that I translate
the document into HTML and this email is to let you know that I have done
that and will send either a ZIP or STUFFIT archive of the document to
anyone interested.

I know that maybe I should get a web site and put the paper there but I'm
not up for designing a web page or maintaining it. If you would like a copy
of the document and would also like to put it on your web site, let me know
that too.

The HTML version of the document consists of 36 fairly small GIFs that
illustrate the words. The STUFFIT archive is 328K and the ZIP file is 320K.
The documentation for the Mac based ZIP program claims that the file can be
successfully unZIPped on non-Mac platforms. The STUFFIT archive is
self-extracting if you're Mac enabled.

Send me an email if you are interested in either the program or the HTML
document or both. If you just want the document, tell me which format you
want. If you ask for the program I will assume you have a Mac and will send
everything in a STUFFIT sea.

Regards to all...
