#1. D2 F2 L2 D' U  L2 F2 D' U'
#2. U  D  B2 R2 U  D' L2 B2 U2

These positions "look" very symmetric, especially #2, but I have not yet
examined their symmetry characteristics in detail.  They are certainly not
Q-transitive.  I do not know if either position has been reported before,
has a name, etc.  The corners are identical between the two positions, but
the edges are a good bit different.  I find both positions to be very
pretty.
