Yes, if the corners of the top layer are also in the right place.  You can
move them around by normal 3x3x3 moves, but in doing so you may find that
the parity of the edge pieces is changed.  If you can swap a pair of edge
pieces on a 4x4x4, all will be well, and all the pieces in the ring of
eight around the piece at the centre of each face can be dealt with by
3-cycles to move these pieces to a different face or around on the same
face.

There is a hidden complication.  The new type of pieces introduced by the
5x5x5 are those at N, S, E and W in the central block of nine in each face.
 If the corner pieces of the cube are correctly placed, the parity of these
new pieces is tied to that of the edge pieces introduced by the 4x4x4, i.e.
those next to the corner pieces of the cube.  So if a pair of these edge
pieces is swapped, so will be a pair of the new 5x5x5 central pieces.  But
the swap of the edge pieces will cure them at the same time.  Often the
change to the centre pieces will not even show, because it will take place
within the same face.  Thus the sequence Georges Helm gave some time ago to
swap the 4x4x4 edges also cures the 5x5x5 centre pieces.  If it is applied
to a cube in the start position, it swaps Bl and Br visibly, and
interchanges FHl and FHr (where H is the central slice parallel to U)
invisibly.  It also makes an even-parity change to the 4x4x4 centre pieces
on the front face - in fact it rotates by 180 degrees the (l, u+H+d) and
(r, u+H+d) strips on this face.
