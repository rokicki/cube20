 Jin Kim's comment, with which I heartily agree, leads me to wonder
whether some entrepreneur might support small-scale manufacture of a
very well-made 3^3, on the order of the Ideal deluxe Cube (I have
forgotten what they called it).

 That Cube had a redesigned mechanism (it differed only in the details)
that would tolerate much more misalignment, before making a maneuver,
than the typical Cubes. It had attached plastic colored tiles instead of
stickers, and was made of an excellent "engineering plastic".

 There are commercially-available materials that are self-lubricating,
and these could be used for the wearing surfaces. The pivots could be
true bearings, that is to say, like those in a typical piece
of machinery. (The Ideal Cube might have had such.} Tests to 250,000
revolutions might be reasonable.

 Whether it makes sense to try to improve upon that already very-good
design, I can't say.

 Consider chess, go, checkers or dominoes. I think the Cube quite
rightly should take its place with them.

 Imho, the Cube and its direct derivatives are the most ingenious
mechanisms ever invented.
