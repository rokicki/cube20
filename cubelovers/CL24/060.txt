Subject: Auction on Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4) cubes

Paul Hart <hart@iserver.com> has announced he has 6 unopened Rubik's
Revenge cubes for sale to the highest bidder.  The Cube-lovers list
will not include details of the offer; I am passing this information
on only because a number of persons on this list have asked about
finding Rubik's Revenge cubes, apparently without success.  Contact
hart@iserver.com for any further information.  As always, beware of
fraud.
