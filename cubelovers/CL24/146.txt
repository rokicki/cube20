Subject: Rubik's Cube FAQ
References: <9801281031.ZM27368@neuhelp.corp.sgi.com>

Is there such a thing as a Rubik's-type puzzle FAQ?  There is interest among
several people who wish to create one (specifically for www.rubiks.com) but if
there's already another that exists, there's no reason to duplicate effort if
it's not necessary.  If anybody knows of such a FAQ, please let me know.
