wow, that's quite a bit faster than my optimal solver!  how about searches
through other depths (20q, 21q, 23q, ... )?  does the run time depend upon
the input position?  could you describe your searching algorithm?  i'm
sure that this would be of interest to many people on the cube-lovers
mailing list.

i already posted data for these positions, but it's always nice to have
confirmation.  however, ...

this is solvable in 18q:

) 3.  U  R  U' F  D  R  L' B' L' F  R  F  B' U' L' D  B' D'          (18q, 18f)

although i gave it in a different orientation.

there's a slight typo here; the last twist should be  L' .
