Subject: RE: Taiwanese Invention of the Cube?

	The earliest idea was due to someone in California, named
William O.  Gustafson (US patent 3,081,089 of 12 Mar 1963).  He had a
2^3 in the shape of a sphere, but he had the problem of keeping the
interior parts in synch with the outer parts and so he left gaps
between the pieces.  Basically he had an interior sphere with grooves
and the pieces had lips.  There are two versions - the first seems
like it wouldn't work well, if at all, but the second seems fairly
feasible.
	Unfortunately, Gustafson let his patent lapse, so the patent
of Larry Nichols was the next, with US patent 3,655,201 (applied 4 Mar
1970, issued 11 Apr 1972).  This had only the idea of a cubical puzzle
and no practical mechanism, so I don't consider it very significant,
but Nichols sued Rubik, more or less successfully - I never heard the
conclusion of the story.
	Frank Fox (UK patent 1,344,259, applied for on 9 Apr 1970 and
issued on 16 Jan 1974) seems to be next.  He had a 3^3 sphere with
tongue and grooves holding the pieces together, with a hollow center.
He had let his patent lapse also.
	In 1976-1980, Terutoshi Ishige devised and patented two
mechanisms for a 2^3., similar to Rubik's.  This may be the source of
the story you were asking about.
	However, there is another odd story.  The first French writers
on the Cube record that a old friend said he had played with such a
cube (in wood) in Istanbul in 1920 and in Marseilles about 1935.
However, no further evidence of such an early version has appeared.
	I forgot to set this to send myself a copy.  Could you forward
it back to me.  Also you might like to send it to
cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu
	Regards
