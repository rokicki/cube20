Subject: optimal solver is available

for those who are interested in my optimal cube solver, you can now
get it from the web page

     http://www.math.brown.edu/~reid/rubik/optimal_solver.html

i've reduced the size of my transformation tables, so now i think there's
a reasonable chance that it will run within 80Mb of RAM.

enjoy the program.  if you make any new exciting discoveries, please share
them with the entire mailing list.
