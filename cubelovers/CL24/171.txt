The reason #2 "looks" so symmetric is that it is an isoglyph.  That is,
each face contains only two colors and the pattern of colors is the same
on all six faces.  If I am reading Dan Hoey's glyph table correctly, the
glyph is of type 20.  The glyph looks like the following, and the glyph
itself is fairly symmetric.

  XOX
  OXO

On a lark, I asked Herbert Kociemba's Cube Explorer 1.5 program to find
all isoglyphs which can be built with this glyph.  Any such isoglyph is
likely to be pretty.  Up to symmetry, it found four isoglyphs (one of
which is #2, which is a strong local maximum in the face turn metric).
The other three are as follows:

F2 U2 L' R  D2 F2 L' R                       8f
F2 U2 B2 L2 U' B2 U' B2 L2 D2 L2 U  R2 U'   14f
U' L2 D' L2 D  B2 F2 L2 R2 D  F2 U' F2 U'   14f

Cube Explorer 1.5 was able to show that the 8f maneuver is minimal.
This position is not a strong local maximum, because the shortest strong
local maxima are 9f.

Cube Explorer 1.5 was not able to show that the 14f maneuvers are
minimal in the time I gave it (six hours each on a Pentium 166).  But I
suspect that 14f is in fact minimal.  Also, I do not know if the 14f
maneuvers are strong local maxima because my search for strong local
maxima extended only through 9f from Start.
