Subject: Re: Open and Closed Subgroups of G

I'd like to thank Jerry for taking the time to put together his 
message discussing basic group theory as it applies to the cube as
well as the basics of Thistlewaite's algorithm.  Although I consider
myself somewhat beyond the "layman" level in this area, I'm not
always able to follow the various posts to this group.  Besides,
it's also helpful to read a little "refresher" every now and then
to help reinforce and clarify previously digested concepts.

It might also be helpful for someone to cover the basics of cube
parity.  Although I think I understand the basic group theoretic
concepts of permutation parity, the asymmetry of the marked faces
of the cube have never quite left me feeling comfortable about
how this concept is applied to the cube.  Hofstadter, covers this,
but does not discuss it in enough detail for one to fully grasp
the concept.

Regards,
