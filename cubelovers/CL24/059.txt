The new ones, at least the ones that I've gotten in the last year or less,
are made by Oddz-on (sp?).  I think that they still make them but I haven't
looked in a few months.  I called them a few months ago to see if they had
plans to make a 4x4x4 but they said no.  Also they did make 2x2x2's for
awhile but I don't think they do anymore, plus the 2's were hard to rotate
and fell apart eaisly.
