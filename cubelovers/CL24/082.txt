If it can be built and scrambled, it can be solved.  In fact, it could
make for a very interesting puzzle since it could behave identically
to a 3x3x3 if one wanted it to, just like a 4x4x4 can be manipulated
like a 2x2x2.  Heck, the 6x6x6 could also behave like a 2x2x2...  One
puzzle could take the place of two others.  Sort of a "mix and match"
difficulty setting.  Regardless, I suspect that many would applaud the
ingenuity of a 6x6x6 if it was executed elegantly and worked well,
like the 5x5x5.

The moderator of the mailing list stated that a 7x7x7 cube could be
built, but I counter that it would require "cubes" of dissimilar size
or some kind of groove type scheme, which actually isn't quite in the
spirit of a cube.  Even a 6x6x6 would require some careful engineering
since the corner cubes just barely overlap.

The mechanism of the 2x2x2 is similar to the 4x4x4, which makes both
of them rather stiff.

I'm sure supersets of many existing puzzles have been considered.  I
myself spent some hours contemplating and drafting the possibility of
a pyraminx to the next level.  I called it Tut's Curse as a sort of
'project' name, despite the fact that Tut was never buried in a
pyramid.  Maybe that's why I never completed the project.  Oh well.
