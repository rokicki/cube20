Your problem is one of parity.  You have two edges cubies swapped (this
swap is visible) and two face center (centre) cubies of the same color
swapped (this swap is invisible).  You have to have an even number of
swaps in the total cube.  If you want an even number in the edges (and
you do), then you also have to have an even number in the face centers,
even if swaps in the face centers are invisible.

There is probably a more elegant solution, but the following will work. 
If you encounter the situation you describe, make any middle slice
quarter turn.  This will disturb the centers.  The centers will now have
an even numbers of swaps. Solve the centers again without simply undoing
the middle slice you just made.  The parity of the edges will then be
ok.  (I'm assuming that your solution for the face centers will maintain
their parity after you correct it as described.)
