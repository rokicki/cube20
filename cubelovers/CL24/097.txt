The way I approach this is to begin with the following simple 3-cycle for
edge cubies (note that this cycles only the cubies and leave the rest of
the cube unaltered):

1] Imagine the involved cubies in the following configuration:

Top face :  . . c .      Left face: . . . .
            . . . .                 a . . .
            . . . .                 . . . .
            . b . .                 . . . .

2] Perform the following sequence:

 - Rotate Front Face by 1/4 turn clockwise.
 - Rotate the slice just below the Top Layer by 180 dgs.
 - Rotate the Front Face by 1/4 turn counter-clockwise.
 - Rotate the Top Face by 180 dg.
 - Rotate Front Face by 1/4 turn clockwise.
 - Rotate the slice just below the Top Layer by 180 dgs.
 - Rotate the Front Face by 1/4 turn counter-clockwise.
 - Rotate the Top Face by 180 dg.

This will result in:

Top face :  . . b .      Left face: . . . .
            . . . .                 c . . .
            . . . .                 . . . .
            . a . .                 . . . .

with all other cubies in their original locations.

3] Once this step is mastered, it is now only a question of moving the
cubies that you want to swap into the approriate location for this operator
to do its work.

For example, in your example above this can be accomplished by (this
assumes that the figure you have drawn above is your Top Face):

 - Rotating the Left-most two slices 1/4 turn clockwise (i.e. towards you)
 - Rotating the Top Face 1/4 turn counter-clockwise.

If you now rotate the entire cube by 90dgs clockwise, you will see your
three cubies are now in the proper location to use the above operator.
(When you're done with the operator, repeat the steps just above in the
reverse order to finish.)

These are just variations on the above.  They will be left an exercise for
the reader.  ;-)

Hope this helps.
