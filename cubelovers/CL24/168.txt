Two other URL's to point the members of this list to...


First, I have perfected custom cube sticker technology!   Check out:
      http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kristin/CustomCubes.html

If anyone has a custom cube they have been itching to make
for years...  as long as you provide the cube sans stickers and
artwork in the size and format that I need it in...  and probably
postage to send it back to you if very many people take me up
on this...   talk to me...  together we can make you the cube of
your dreams.   A word of warning:  Odz On has done an excellent
job of solving the stickers-always-falling-off problem on the
new cubes.  You will have a MUCH easier time getting the stickers
off an old cube than you will one of the new ones.  Zarf designed
a REALLY cool cube last week...  a picture of it should go up on this
page with this weeks update on Thursday.


Also, Jake has been continuing to evolve his cube art...  Check out:
      http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeInfo/

I have a window in my gameroom with 120 cubes arranged within
it...  and every couple of weeks or so Jake comes over and solves
them into some sort of a cool 36 x 30 pixel picture.  Jake and Zarf
and Andy and myself have all designed images, and we are not out
of ideas yet...  but I'm guessing Jake would take outside design
submissions if you asked him.
