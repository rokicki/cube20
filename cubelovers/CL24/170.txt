Subject: RE: Game designers [was Re: Rubik lawyers...]

	In my Cubic Circular 1 (Autumn 1981), I recorded that Wim
Osterholt, of the Netherlands, had made and patented a 4^3 which he
showed me.  I don't remember it and I'm not sure when he brought it to
London - perhaps Summer 1981?  I also recorded that Rainier Seitz
(product manager of Arxon which was Ideal's German agent) showed me
some German patents and applications for the 4^3 and 5^3.  In Cubic
Circular 2 (Spring 1982), I record talking with another person who had
devised a 4^3 mechanism.  In Cubic Circular 3/4 (Spring/Summer 1982),
I describe playing with examples.  However, I don't recall ever
knowing who devised the mechanism that was produced for Ideal.  It was
common knowledge that it was not Rubik's mechanism.  One may be able
to get details from the web site that Oddz On (sp??) has set up.  Tom
Kremer (of Seven Towns, who is Rubik's agent) is supervising this site
and he would be one of the most likely people to know.  I have a huge
file of material comprising all US puzzle patents and I'll look there,
but I think I would have known about the patent for the 4^3 already.
