Subject: "A Message from Professor Erno Rubik"

I just accidentally tripped across http://www.rubiks.com/.  Much to my
amusement the home page has a little message from Erno Rubik that begins:

  It is 23 years since I created the Cube, some 17 years since this simple
  little six-coloured object attained its great world wide appeal. I often
  wondered what impact the Internet would have had if it had been around at
  the time.  Cube awareness, for one thing, would have spread even faster,
  aggravating the already severe Cube shortages in the market place.
  Suggestions and disputes about different approaches to solving it would
  surely have filled the screens. Amusing, unusual, interesting tales to do
  with the Cube would have criss-crossed the globe on the Net and intrigued
  mathematicians would have proposed and discussed Cube related theories
  on-line.

Those of you who have been on this mailing list for the last 17 years will
recognize this as an uncannily accurate description of exactly what -did-
happen!  (Except, of course, the Net was so much smaller then that we had
little effect on the market place.)

So accurate is Prof. Rubik's description that I'd be surprised if he (or his
ghost writer) hasn't actually read through some of our earliest archives.
