Probably (I'm not totally certain) it was Udo Krell, an inventor whose
design was used by Uwe Meffert to make the 5x5x5.

What about Karl Hornell's Java Applet "Rubik Unbound"?? It's
all over the internet on hundreds of sites including my
own!!

I don't think the name Rubik itself can expire since that
is his name... so the name of the product is always
"Rubik's Cube"... ummmm right? :-)

I don't think you can prevent people from making java applets and the
like of cubes... but I think they (the lawyers that be) can protect
Rubik's name. I don't think anyone can say "Don't show a rubik's
cube-like construction on your web page".

The other guy who history has forgotten was Larry Nichols who made
a 2x2x2 cube called twizzle which routinely came apart and was
rejected by Ideal Toy!

I'd restore the 3x3x3 java applet if it was my web page.
