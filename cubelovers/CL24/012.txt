Let me see what I can do to muddy these waters. 

It seems to me that we might ought to consider the chirality of an
isoglyph as being a different issue than the chirality of a glyph.  I
think the two are clearly related, but I am not sure that the one
necessarily derives from the other. 

As to a glyph, it seems to me that a glyph is chiral only if conjugating
the position by each of the four reflections of the square yields a
different set of positions than does conjugating the position by each of
the four rotations of the square.  Hence, you can have a glyph which
occurs in right-handed or left-handed forms, or one that doesn't.  This
is the simple part. 

I think the situation with isoglyphs is a little more complicated.  For
example, form an isoglyph using both the right-handed and the
left-handed forms of a chiral glyph.  You might have 6 right-handed
glyphs and 0 left-handed glyphs, 5 right-handed glyphs and 1 left-handed
glyph, etc.  If there are unequal numbers of right-handed and
left-handed glyphs, then it seems natural to define the handedness of
the isoglyph as being that of the dominate glyph.  But what if there are
three right-handed glyphs and three left-handed glyphs?

Up to symmetry, there are only two ways to partition the six faces of a
cube into two sets of three faces.  For example, the F, U, and B faces
can be of the same chirality, or the F, U, and R faces can be of the
same chirality (or any conjugates of these choice of faces).  In the
first case, the cube is partitioned like a universal joint, or maybe
like a cubic baseball.  Such a position seems to me to lack chirality. 
In the second case, three faces with the same chirality cluster around a
common corner.  Again, such a position seems to me to lack chirality. 
So an isoglyph which lacks chirality can contain chiral glyphs.

On the other hand, even on an isoglyph consisting of three right-handed
and three left-handed glyphs, you still might be able to find a
distinguishing characteristic of the right hand part that was different
from the left-handed part.  For example, the glyph boundaries which were
internal to the right-handed part of the isoglyph might be continuous
whereas the glyph boundaries which were internal to the left-handed part
of the isoglyph might not be continuous.  Or for another example, the
rotations of the three right-handed faces relative to each other might
be different than the rotations of the left-handed faces relative to
each other. 

(By the way, I have not verified that any of these positions I have
described are actually in G.  I guess I am thinking in terms of the
constructible group of the facelets -- conceptually, peeling all the
facelets off and reattaching them.) 

On the other hand, two glyphs which lack chirality when placed side by
side can be chiral.  For example,

       XOOXXX   (the base glyph is XXX
       XXXOXO                      OXO
       XOOOXO                      OXO )

I really haven't thought through the implications of using six glyphs
instead of two, but it seems to me quite likely that an isoglyph could
be constructed using six glyphs which lack chirality and which are the
same pattern, and where the we could attribute chirality to the isoglyph
as a whole. 

I have thought about this in terms of Herbert's Cube Explorer 1.5
program.  The pattern editor has a check box for continuous.  If you
don't check the box, the program finds both continuous and
non-continuous isoglyphs.  If you do check the box, it finds only
continuous ones.  So I have considered what would happen if the program
had a check box for chiral.  What should it do?  The obvious thing would
be that in normal operation, it would consider conjugates of both
rotations and reflections of the square when building an isoglyph from a
glyph, but that if the chiral box were checked it would consider only
conjugates of rotations of the square.  But is that sufficient to
satisfy our various definitions of chiral, achiral, and/or non-chiral?
I'm not sure.  Maybe Dan or Mike would be kind enough to clarify further
their thoughts on this issue.
