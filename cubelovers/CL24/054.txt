I've owned only one 5-Cube and have had no mechanical problem with it
at all.  I bought it in mid-December 1993, but unfortunately I don't
know where it came from.  I probably got it at a retail toy/game store
here in the city called Valet de Coeur ("Jack of Hearts" in French),
but (a) am not sure of even that by now (though I have trouble
imagining where else might have had it) and (b) I have no idea where it
was made or what distributor they got it from.

I sure have, with my 5-Cube.  Three of the 25 have come off, and one
has been completely lost (the other two are attached to the cube with a
piece of masking tape, pending my doing something more permanent).  I
may do to it what I did to one of my 3-Cubes recently: take all the
stickers off and use plastic-model paint to color the cubies.  (I
actually may do this to just the orange face, since that's the only
problematic one.)
