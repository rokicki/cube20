Maybe i was a little fast to state that it is "generally known Rubik did
not design the 4x4x4 mechanism". I've also digged through the entire list
archives as well as my own stuff, and have found nothing which directly
indicated that Rubik DID design it. Now the earliest mention of 4x4x4 is in
Hofstadter's article in S.A. from march '81, page 26. Quote: "Rest assured,
it's being developed in the Netherlands, and it may be ready soon..."

Don't you think it would be known that Udo Krell also invented the 4x4x4 if
this was indeed the case?
All of this is getting a little vague, it could be nice to have this matter
cleared up by someone who has some REAL info! Maybe someone who worked for
Ideal at the time.
