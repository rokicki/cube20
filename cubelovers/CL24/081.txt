Ok folks, one last bit of info about the cube colour controversy

The colouring "standard" I was referring to was used by Canadian and
the USA cube contests. Having said that there were probably contests
where people brought there own cubes, and that would make it potpourri.

Moreover, this was stipulated in the rules of the contest. I still have
the form. The only difference between differ by yellow and the standard
Ideal cube was the transposition of yellow and blue.

There isn't really a standard orientation, save for the orientation 
I use in my own cube programs. All the Ideal cubes I have conform
to White/Blue, Yellow/Green, Red/Orange for Top/Down, Front/BACK,
Left/Right.

So I suppose it is open to interpretation. I thought David Singmaster 
might mention what colour arrangement was used in the World Championship.

So a case may be made for both "Differ by Yellow" and Ideal Contest
Colours.

Would someone like to pick one?? :-)
