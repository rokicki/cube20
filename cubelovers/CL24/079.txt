Subject: Cubes in London

In one month I am going to London for a few days and I would like to
know where I can buy brainteasers there (mainly Rubik's cubes and
related puzzles).
Could you help me and send me all the information you have?

In Brussels, Belgium, you can (sometimes) find Magic Dodecahedron,
Pyraminx, Skewb and "555" cube at

   Dedale
   Galerie du Cinquantenaire
   Avenue de Tervuren 32
   1040 Brussels

Thank you for your help.

Geoffroy <Geoffroy.VanLerberghe@ping.be>
