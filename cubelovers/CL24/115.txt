Subject: Re: 5x5x5
To: "Cube Lovers" <Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu>

My way of solving the 5x5x5 has been to think about the cube in 3x3x3
terms.  When I solve a 3x3x3, I do top corners, bottom corners, top
and bottom edges at the same time, and then middle edges.

When I do a 5x5x5, I think of the middle corners (those cubies
directly diagonal from the center) as corners to the 3x3x3, ignoring
completely the outside edges, and I solve them so that all the middle
corners are aligned like a 3x3x3 would be aligned.  Then I solve the
middle edges (those cubies directly next to the center) like I would
solve the edges from 3x3x3 cubes.  This leaves the nine cubies in the
center of each face sovled.

I then use a move which many people use when solving a 4x4x4 to get
all the edge pieces together without disturbing the center squares.
This finally leaves me with messed up corners, solved center squares,
and the three edges on each side together.  I then view this as a
3x3x3 and solve that using my normal method.  The only drawback is
that I sometimes cannot get the edges to all work together, and the
reason is that I have inadvertantly switched two middle corners, and
it takes a long time for me to fix them.

If anyone wants more information on this solution, I'll spell it out
in detail on my web page.
