Subject: re: save a cube for the price of a stamp

My situation was similar to Dave's.  I sent him a response, and forgot
to cc it to the list.  I thought it would be beneficial [for me to send
it] for everyone on the list who may be in the same, or similar boat.
Here's what I told Dave...

The guy to talk to is Christoph Bandelow.  His email address is
Christoph.Bandelow@ruhr-uni-bochum.de.  (I'm pretty sure he monitors the
list.)  He is located in Germany.  He also has a bunch of other puzzles
that you will be interested in.  He is very prompt with delivering
orders, and is very easy to work with.

Hope this helps.
