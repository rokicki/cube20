I have a German book by Kurt ENDL on how to solve the whole bunch of 2x2x2,
3x3x3, 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 cubes.
I have a xeroxed copy of a solution by myself.
I do upper middles, edges, corners.
Then 2d, 3d and 4th layer edges.
Then 2d, 3d and 4th layer middles.
Then last layer corners and finally last layer edges.

Sometimes parity is uneven, i,e, there remain 2 edges to swap, and
there is a move I use to resolve that problem without disturbing the
rest of the cube by Helmut GEMBITZKY.

[ Moderator's note: As has been mentioned previously, there is a
general solution method in Eidswick, J. A., "Cubelike Puzzles -- What
Are They and How Do You Solve Them?", 'American Mathematical Monthly',
Vol. 93, #3, March 1986, pp. 157-176, though it's not optimized. ]
