Dan's response (plus his references in the Cube-Lovers archives) pretty
well covers it.  I would just like to add a couple of points.

  1. There is a reference in the archives to a way of demonstrating
     conservation of twist without first establishing a frame of
     reference, but I can't find the reference.  The best I can
     recall, the same technique did not work for edges.  But I prefer
     the frame of reference technique anyway because it is closely
     tied to some of the more usual ways of representing the cube in a
     computer.

  2. For example, number the corner facelets from 1 to 24.  Each
     facelet has two companion facelets which are bound to it on
     the same cubie.  By knowing where one of the three facelets
     of a cubie is in a computer program, you automatically know
     where the other two facelets are, so you only have to store
     one of the three facelets.  The one that you store can be the
     "special" facelet that Dan described for the purposes of
     determining conservation of twist.

     The collection of eight "special" facelets for the corners
     have been described in the archives as constituting a
     supplement for the group, but I have yet to find a discussion
     group supplements in any group theory book.

     As Dan says, your choice of "special" facelet is totally 
     arbitrary for each cubie, but most typically you choose
     the Front and Back facelets, or the Right and Left facelets,
     or something equally well organized.

  3. For another example, number the corner cubies from 1 to 8, and 
     for each of the cubies describe the twist with a number from 0
     to 2.  This is essentially a wreath product representation of
     the cube.  The numbers from 0 to 2 which describe the twist
     can be used to describe whether a cubie is twisted when it is
     not home, and can therefore be used to prove conservation of
     twist.

     Without knowing any more than I do about supplements, it seems
     very likely that it should be easy to represent any group 
     which can be representated as a supplement as a wreath product
     and vice versa.  The isomorphism seems obvious.  I wonder if
     anybody out there can shed any light on this issue?
