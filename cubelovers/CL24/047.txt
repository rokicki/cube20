Hello,
  I wonder if someone can suggest a way to fix my 3x3x3 cube.  The screw
  that holds a center cubie to the spindle has stripped out of the spindle.
  I thought of just super-glueing it back in; would this work?  Also, I
  wonder if there is to be any tension (compression) on the spring inside
  the center cubie when the screw is set in?  I'm afraid that I will have to
  open up the center cubie and use a driver to screw the cube together
  again.  I don't want to pry open my center cubie.
  Thanks for any suggestions.
