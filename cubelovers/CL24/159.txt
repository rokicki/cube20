Fine.  Please restore your web site, but say:

"Please enjoy these puzzles yourself.  However, we
cannot honor the famous Dr. Rubik because his lawyers
won't let us honor him."

It doesn't matter if you take money or not.  I thought it
didn't hurt if you had advertisements honoring Dr. Rubik,
but ...

Well, I guess everyone had better remove Rubik's signature
from our instances of his merchandise, because whenever we
play with one of his products, we're advertising his name
illegally.  [Note:  This is the only sarcastic sentence
in this message.  Please take the rest seriously.]

It is true that none of their mechanism is involved.
Therefore I believe their patent doesn't apply.  That is,
if they actually still have a pattent, after Ishige and
some American who preceded all of them (whose name I've
forgotten) ...  but wait, it's been more than 20 years
(or 17 in the US), so ALL their patents have expired.

So don't honor Dr. Rubik.  Please restore all of your
mathematical puzzles.
