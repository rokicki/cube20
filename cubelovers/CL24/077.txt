Subject: RE: Colour arrangements (Was: Re: Megaminx, the 10-spot and GAP)

	The colour arrangement on the early Hungarian cubes was quite random!!
I even have two examples where two faces have the same colour!!  It was not
until about 1980 that the idea of having a standardised colour pattern was
adopted and the most common was to have the opposite faces differ by yellow.
That is the opposite faces were  White - Yellow,  Blue - Green,  Red - Orange.
Rubik went to some effort to select six colours that would be maximally
distinct, but I think the yellow, red and orange tended to be too close in the
sense that either the orange was too close to the red or too close to the
yellow! 
	However, this does not completely determine the colour pattern.  Just
as with a die, there are two possible arrangements.  Conway and Guy etc.
observed that Blue, Orange and Yellow meet at a corner and they can occur
clockwise or counterclockwise, spelling  BOY  or  YOB.  Some people have
expressly asked me for one form rather than the other!
	An early anecdote, from about 1979.  A friend's son was trying to help
another friend solve his cube over the telephone.  This is a pretty formidable
task at the best of times, but their two cubes had different colour patterns,
so the son was making statements like: turn the red face, that's blue on your
cube, ....
