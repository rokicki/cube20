I have not yet added the logic for weak local maxima, but further perusing
of my printout from the run which has already been made does yield a bit
of confirmation to some previous results reported by others.

At each distance from Start, my program summarizes the number of patterns
and positions by the symmetry class (one of the 33 symmetry classes of M,
the group of 48 symmetries of the cube).  Hence, I can easily look for
"highly symmetric" positions based on the symmetry class.  Of the 72
positions defined as q-transitive by Jim Saxe and Dan Hoey in Symmetry and
Local Maxima, only 4 of them show up in the search through 9f.  One of
them is at 0f (Start), one of them is at 6f (Pons Asinorum, a weak local
maximum, only the six half turns move closer to Start), and two of them
are at 8f (the two conjugate 6-H positions, weak local maxima with only
the six half turns moving closer to Start).

We therefore know that the two patterns at 9f which are strong local
maxima are not q-transitive, and cannot be shown to be local maxima by
symmetry considerations alone.

Strictly speaking, we already knew all this based on Dan's study of Pons
Asinorum from many years ago, and based on Mike Reid's recent studies of
highly symmetric positions with his optimal cube solver.  Jim Saxe found
the 8f processes for the 6-H positions many years ago, but I do not
believe that they were shown to be minimal until Mike's recent work.
