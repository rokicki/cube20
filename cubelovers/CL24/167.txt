I worked for Ideal at the time...   but only as a 16 year old kid
demonstrating the cube and giving away free T-Shirts and posters
in shopping malls in the Chicago area.  Sorry, I have no idea who
invented the 4x4 mechanism.  I do remember anxiously waiting
for the mail every day for a couple of weeks when they had said
they were sending me one hot off the assembly line...
