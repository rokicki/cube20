Count me among the few "self-taught" solvers who don't actually
use this, then.  The one I worked out for myself a long time ago
turns out to be:

[r, FUF']

which is of a similar form, but P and Q are not parallel.

As a consequence of this, the permutation is not "clean": i.e.,
some other cubies get disturbed.  As these are all face cubies
anyway, I just modified my solution so that I do the face cubies
last.  :-)
