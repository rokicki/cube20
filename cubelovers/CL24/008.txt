At the risk of being repetitious, the answer is, "relative to the home
orientation of the position they find themselves in".  You choose a
special facelet for each corner cubie.  When the cubie is in its home
position, its twist is the position of its special facelet relative to
the home of the special facelet.  When cubie X is in cubie Y's home
position, the twist of cubie X is the position of X's special facelet
relative to the home of Y's special facelet.  The edges are done the
same way, except mod 2.

Cube-lovers can find this in Vanderschel's article (6 Aug 1980) and
the extension by Saxe (3 September 1980).  I mentioned (23 September
1982) that the choice of special facelets is arbitrary, and that a
conservation of twist occurs for a set of pieces of any puzzle that

    1. have an Abelian orientation group, and
    2. are moved in untwisted cycles by the generators.

This is true even if not all the cycles have the same length.  For
instance, we could have a Rubik's cube in which generators move
corners in permutations like (FTR,FRD,FDL,FLT)(BRT,BTL,BLD), and twist
would be preserved.  The key is that for each piece, the minimum power
of the generator that returns that piece to its home position must
also return it to its home orientation.

I'm quite uncertain about what orientation constraints can arise in
puzzles with non-Abelian orientation groups.  For instance, the
hypercorners of a Rubik's tesseract have the symmetry group A4, and
any orientation is achievable up to a constraint imposed by an Abelian
quotient of A4 of type 3 (See 22 Oct 1982).  Does every group have a
unique maximal Abelian quotient?  Is that the only orientation
constraint that can occur?
