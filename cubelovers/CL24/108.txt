How about, "yay?"  I hope that by having the cube re-emerge and become
once again a fairly popular item, many other unique pieces will make a
return, like the RUBIKS REVENGE, as an example.  And perhaps then they
will become a stable commodity instead of just burning out after just an
intense period of a couple of years.  A Hula Hoop is a fad.  A piece
like the Cube is Timeless.
