Subject: Where to get Dino Cube?
Message-Id: <19971231.143151.14726.0.tenie1@juno.com>
From: tenie1@juno.com (Tenie Remmel)

Is there a current source for the Dino Cube?  Both the
vertex turning kind (with 12 pieces one for each edge)
and the edge turning kind (with 24 pieces four on each
face).

Is Gametrends still around?  The phone number given in
a message in 1995 does not work.
