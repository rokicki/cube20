Subject: RE: Rubik lawyers up in arms over website -- Digest v23 #279]

	Norman Diamond refers to the patents expiring.  However, Rubik
only had a Hungarian patent.  As a result, the various Rubik companies
took legal action under copyright law, and copyright lasts much
longer.
	Perhaps I should hassle Seven Towns about the use of my notation!
