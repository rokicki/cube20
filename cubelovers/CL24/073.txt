I remember having one if the early Ideal cubes (at least I think it
was), and green was opposite blue.

Recently I bought one of those "odds-on" cubes, and within a week I
wore the plastic coating off the faces, so I decided to peel all the
stickers off and paint it using model paint.  I decided to keep the
most similar colors opposite each other (blue-green, red-orange,
yellow-white).  I find this arrangement makes things easier when
cubing under dim lighting. :)
