NWell, this is more a "cube-sighting" than an answer to the question whether
cubes will soon become more easily available, but I notice that in the new
(i.e. 4Jan98) New York Times Book Review, on the  inside of the front cover
is a small ad consisting of a (b&w) photo of a (3X) cube with the
over-laying copy:

          NEVER
            A
           DULL
         WEEKEND

   Our enhanced, two-part
     Weekend section is
   full of ideas about ways
      to broaden your
         horizons.


I couldn't quite figure out, though, whether the ad intended the cube to
symbolize the "broaden[ed] horizons", or the "dull weekend"...
