Subject: Megaminx

On 1/6/98 Jonathan Tuliani described a Megaminx with 6 colors.  I have
a Megaminx purchased when they first came out.  It has 10 colors.
They are positioned so that there is only one "twin" pair on the
puzzle.  There are two red/yellow edge pieces.  It was a major
personal discovery when I found that the puzzle was only solvable if
the red/yellow pieces were put in the "right" places.  Only having one
twin pair made the puzzle particularly difficult because it took so
long before I noticed their existence.

I am sure that many readers will want to know if Megaminx is back in
production.  Jonathan, were did yours come from?
