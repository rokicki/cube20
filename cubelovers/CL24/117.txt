Subject: Getting a 4x4x4 or a 5x5x5

As a relative newbie to the cube world, I only have a 3x3x3.  Would there
be any chance that I would find a used 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 cube around for less
than an arm and a leg? The new 4's went for around $100 in that auction a
little while ago, and that scared me....

Any Info would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,
Ryan

[Moderator's note: The 5x5x5 cubes may be more available.  You can use
 one to practice 4x4x4 moves by ignoring the central slices (except in
 that you  have to keep them aligned with an adjacent slice).]
