An interesting thing to note regarding the color patterns on cubes...
on the Rubik's Cube home page (http://www.rubiks.com) a picture is
displayed showing Dr. Rubik himself holding a mixed cube in his hand.
On a whim I decided to figure out what the color scheme of the cube
was.

If you wish to figure out yourself without being told, or if you just
want to try to refute my guess (I'm no stranger to being wrong) then
don't read the "answer" to the puzzle that's below my .sig.
Otherwise, if you can't be bothered with minor trivialities like this
one (it's really not that difficult to figure out the colors anyway)
then read on.

I determined that the color scheme of the cube held in Erno Rubik's hand is:
Front: Red
Back: Orange
Left: Green
Right: Blue
Top: White
Bottom: Yellow
