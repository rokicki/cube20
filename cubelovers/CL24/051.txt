     I'm trying to buy a regular, standard, run-of-the-mill Rubik's cube
which I now realize is not so easy.  Can you please direct me to a
source?  Are they no longer produced?  I got your address from the
mountains of material on the Internet about Rubik.  Is there a store,
a phone number, a person from whom I can buy one.  I'm in Albany, NY
but mail-order is fine.  Thanks in advance for the help!
