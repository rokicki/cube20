  Is the orientation of the above fixed in some way or is it arbitrary ?


  My second cube (can't remember what happened to the first one) is a later
  edition (not sure if it is Ideal) with the same arrangement to above
  except, the orientation is different (UP is either RED or ORANGE) The
  reason I say this is that the LEFT,RIGHT,DOWN and FRONT faces have
  symbols printed in the centre as follows :


  YELLOW - signature of Erno Rubik
  WHITE - Rubik's CUBE tm
  GREEN - C*4**4 (actually uses superscript 4 for the power)
  BLUE - silhouette (of Erno Rubik)


  The symbols are designed to make the cube harder to solve - the challenge
  is to solve the cube with the centre cubes all in the correct
  orientation. I recall that there are sequences of moves that rotate pairs
  of centre cubes.


  This cube is definitely a lot stiffer than my original cube but the
  novelty of speed cubing has worn off anyway.
