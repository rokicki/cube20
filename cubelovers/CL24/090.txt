Subject: Re: 6x6x6 cube design

	I'm sure that this has been mentioned before, but the 6^3
etc. actually introduce no further complications than present on the
4^3 (and 5^3).  There are just more types of center pieces, but they
all behave in much the same way.  In my message on notation and
solution of the 4^3, I gave a method of producing a 3-cycle of center
pieces and it can be used for each class of centre pieces - the puzzle
doesn't get any more interesting, just longer!
	The 6^3 introduces a slightly interesting feature
theoretically in that the center pieces break up into more classes
than one might initially expect because the piece at the (1,2)
location is not in the same class as the piece at the (2,1) location.
(Taking a corner as (0,0).)
