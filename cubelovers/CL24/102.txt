Subject: Large Cube

I realize this is impossible to make, at least in the traditional way, but...

I just saw an add for some computer conference which displayed a 9x9x9 cube
(with  some rather strange colors - at least 7 different ones too!).  The
text read something like (really paraphrased):

"When you were young you could work a cube in 27 seconds, but now you're
older and only have a week to solve this."

So, my question is: Assuming the cube is solvable, can it be done?  What
kind of order of growth to the current algorithms, for human algorithms and
computer algorithms, have in relation to the size of the cube?
