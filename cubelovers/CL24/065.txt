Subject: Availablility of Rubik's Cube

I've followed the thread about the availibility of Rubik's Cubes.
 
Ideal Toy is once again manufacturing Rubik's Cube for the mass market. 
New packaging (with the correct number of permutations) has been 
purchased by myself in a Canadian Toys R Us store just recently.

I know nothing of the Oddz-On cubes, but the new Ideal Toy cubes are
wonderful. The new cubes sport a new logo and brighter colours, but
they use the same colour arrangement as the Ideal Cubes of old.

There is also an official site for Rubik's Cube at http://www.rubiks.com
Unfortunately they are not answering their mail and are attracting a
mostly younger crowd. They are also using Karl Hornell's rubik's cube
java applet (sporting the incorrect colour arrangement I might add) 
without giving any mention of Karl's name. It is an exact byte for 
byte copy. Although Karl does give out the Rubik's Cube java applet
as freeware, I think he deserves credit from the Ideal web site.

As for my own web site (which does sport Karl's java applet with the
correct standard colouration, and also BEFUDDLER support!) I intend
to record the entire chronology of all the cube contests from every
country, including all the records from the World Championships.

My Rubik's Cube web page is currently http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman

If anyone has any information about the cube contests I have missed,
please email me. Thanks!
