[Apologies for taking this even farther off topic.  But in an attempt to
clear up one point...]

Indeed it's quite possible that Rubik knows nothing about it.

The issue here is the legal concept of "Laches", which says --effectively--
that if it can be shown that you, the copyright owner, did not pursue all
incidents of copyright infringement of which you were aware, then the
copyrighted item is in real danger of being declared as in the public
domain.

(This is also what's behind those silly stories of, say, some vet in the
wilds outside Buccolia, Maine with a picture of Snoopy painted on his barn
who one day gets a letter from Charles Schulz's lawyers requesting that he
either remove the picture or else sign a license arrangement at a zillion
dollars a year.)

So, in short, a copyright owner is legally "required" to go after _any_
known or perceived abuse of the copyright or face the very real danger of
losing it.
