	When writing a program to manipulate
the Cube, you're interested in your algorithm.
The output usually looks like RLULRURL
because you won't waste time programming
any graphics.

	I will shortly release a freeware
software component that displays a standard
Rubik's Cube. You can incorporate it into
your software and manipulate the cube
directly. See your cube solutions executed in
front of your eyes.

	For an idea of what this component
will look like, take a Java browser to my
pages at

http://www.iol.ie/~goyra/Rubik.html

	The component will be a Java Bean,
meaning you can use it in Java, and also
in any Activex environment such as Visual
C++ or Visual Basic.

	Anyone with suggestions about how
the programmatic interface to the component
should look, please mail me.

				David
