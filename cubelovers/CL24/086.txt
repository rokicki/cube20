Before people get the wrong idea about the price of cubes on this side of
the Atlantic, I'd better say that the OddZon cube was 9 British pounds in
Hamleys and the Dublin clone was 5 Irish pounds.  I used the pound symbol
and the conversion - I suspect both machine and human - went awry.

I can add to my slightly meandering note on the Dublin clone that the
central spider has now bust.  

Life is full of new hazards.
