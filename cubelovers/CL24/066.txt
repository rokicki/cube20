Subject: Re: Where to buy one???

i've noticed that here in northern ireland, there are a couple of
places selling cubes.  one is a standard copy of the rubik's cube,
and the other is called "magic cube" which has holographic stickers
on it, and the cubies are much squarer making it very difficult to
take apart.. it comes with a locking key which allows you to remove
one of the faces..  the turning mechanism is _really_ loose, too
loose in fact, but mine hasnt fallen apart.   

as an aside, i have an original cube, that my grandmother bought me
16 or 17 years ago, and it's still got all it's original stickers!
