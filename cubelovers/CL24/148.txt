I've a  3 x 3 cube with a rather abstract pattern made up of three
colours. It does require the centered to be orientated correctly.

If I solve the cube, but fail to get the centers correct; is there an
easy solution to rotating them about their axis (I would guess in
opposite pairs?   Singmaster Notation if poss..

Regards
