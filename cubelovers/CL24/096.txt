Subject: RE: Color schemes revisited

	In 1979(?) when I had my company David Singmaster Ltd which dealt in
Cubes and cube-related items, we had a tee-shirt designed showing a jumbled
cube with the caption  Rubik's Cube Cures Sanity.  Only one person ever wrote
in pointing out that the cube was impossible!  From the colouring of various
visible pieces, one could tell that the white face was adjacent to all five
other colours!!
