    [C. McCaig:]
    i recently borrowed a friends 4x4x4, and i know the basic method for
    solving it.  ie get the 6 centres, pair up all the edges, and then
    solve for the normal cube.  however, about half the time i end up
    with a single edge pair inverted and cant figure out a move for
    reorientating the single edge pair.  usually i break a few pairs
    and try and reorientate them this way, but this seems rather longwinded...
    does anyone have a move for this?.  for example, say the green edge
    is on the blue face, and the blue edge is on the green face...
    
What's happened here is that you've got those two edge-cubies
_exchanged_.  Here's how it works.  Look at any face.  You will see
eight edge stickers, arranged around the face like eight square
dancers (or Irish set dancers, if you prefer).  Now I hope you are
familiar with one or the other of these kinds of folk-dancing, because
otherwise what I am going to say won't make sense.  Those eight decals
are either men or women, and no matter how they dance around the cube,
they will never change sex.  Every edge-cubie on the 444 has one
permanently male and one permanently female sticker.  If I haven't
clarified things, at least I've spiced them up a bit.

House around to home.
