I have serveral cubes spanning over a decade and a half in front of me.
Here's the quick color arrangements:

Rubik's Cube (circa 1982)
Up = White
Down = Yellow
Front = Blue
Back = Green
Left = Orange
Right = Red

I've owned this cube for what feels like forever.  I'm not even sure how I
even found it again, because I dug it out of some old junk after not having
a puzzle for about 5 years.  This is slightly different from the one you
described as being from Hungary.  I suspect mine is from there too, so
maybe production values weren't as high as they could be.

Rubik's Cube "4th Dimension" (Golden Toys, circa 1988) - Poor quality in my
opinion, as the stickers are paper with a clear plastic laminate, but
despite only being taken out of the box only 4 Times ever, the plastic
laminate is already peeling in spots.
Rubik's Mini Cube (OddzOn, circa 1996)
Rubik's Cube (OddzOn, circa 1997)

All of the above have the same color arrangement as what you described
below as being the "Ideal" solution, which I believe isn't the best.  I
still think that the opposite pairing of red/orange, white/yellow, and
blue/green makes for the best balanced color combination.  Not to mention
it's also the best quality with plastic stickers instead of paper.
