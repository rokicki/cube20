Subject: God's Number

I just found out that Keith Randall for the theory group of LCS (Lab for
Computer Science) at MIT gave a talk Monday about God's number for the
rubik's cube.  He upped the lower bound 24 and gave "evidence" that it is
24.  I don't know what moves he was counting (e.g. slice, quarter).
Unfortunately, I missed it.  Does anyone have any information on this?
I'll see what I can find out.
