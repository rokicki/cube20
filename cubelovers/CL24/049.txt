We are shortly to create a full VRML site of cubes, and other similar
puzzles a la Rubiks and spacecubes.  It will contain both free and for sale
items and will evolve as demand requests from people like you!!

I am going to be publishing a monthly newsletter from November 1997,
covering 3D puzzles (real and virtual) and SpaceCubes news.  You can sign
up from the first page of our website or by sending an e-mail to
info@spacecubes.com with the subject newsletter.  You will receive a
SpaceCubes info standard letter for now until we set up all the right
autoresponses but I wiil  happily deal with all feedback.

Thankyou and looking forward to giving you good challenges
