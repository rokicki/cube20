Subject: Lights Out Cube

I just heard there's a new puzzle out in the U.S. called "Lights Out Cube".
My first thought was that it's probably from the same company (Tiger
Electronics) who introduced the "Lights Out" and "Deluxe Lights Out".
Anybody who can confirm or knows some more??
It would also be nice if anyone knew a store in the San Francisco Area
where these puzzles are available (i have a friend who can buy them for
me). I haven't seen them in Europe.

Thanks in advance,
