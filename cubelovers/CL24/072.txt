Subject: Megaminx, the 10-spot and GAP

First of all, the STANDARD colour arrangement used by Ideal Toy is as
follows:

UP      = White
DOWN    = Blue
FRONT   = Yellow
BACK    = Green
LEFT    = Red
RIGHT   = Orange

All the official Ideal Toy 2x2x2, 3x3x3 & 4x4x4 cubes used this
arrangement.
Even my 5x5x5 cube is the same.


Secondly, I have at last resolved the 10-spot pattern for the megaminx
in GAP. I created the process m1a which is the sequence of operators
to generate the 10-spot. I had no C_U operator, so it was more
difficult than I thought it would be.

To see all the gory details surf to the following URLs
(These are all GAP text files)

http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/dodeca.txt   describes the megaminx
http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/megaop.txt   describes operators
http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/spot.txt     generates the 10-spot

Note that after executing spot.txt (which loads the other necessary
files) in gives the order of process m1a correctly as 5.

This generator uses all of the megaminx operators except the top and
bottom faces, so it is a pretty good test of the correctness of the
all of dodeca.txt, megaop.txt, and spot.txt

I believe this is the first simulation of the megaminx generating
the 10-spot although Dr. David Joyner is very close! His work is
more graphically interesting (using Maple to generate 3d pics
of the megaminx) but his operators to rotate the whole megaminx
are cooked. However, we have both verified that processes
m2, m3 and m3a are correct and have been graphed correctly using
Maple.
