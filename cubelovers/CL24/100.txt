Forget three adjacent top edges, I just want to cycle two of them.  I've
been solving a 5x5x5, and finally figured out how to make it look like a
3x3x3 so that I could solve nearly all of it.  However, the one place where
I cannot do that is solving the second and fourth edges from any side, and
have been using a short move that cycles three of them:

.axx.      .bxx.
y....      z....
y....  =>  z....
b....      a....
.czz.      .cyy.

The move is 2L F' L F 2L' (where 2L means the second layer from the
left)

This works great for getting nearly all the edges in place, but I have
two edges that are switched, and every time I use this move to put
them in place, I either leave two other edges out of place or leave
four edges out of place.  That is, I have the following:

.baa.                              .aaa.
b....                              c....
b....  which I can only make into  c....
a....                              b....
.ccc.                              .cbb.

which does not help.

I believe that my move works on 4x4x4 edges, and any move that helps a 4x4x4
cube will probably help me.
