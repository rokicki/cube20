 I think these might be made of plastic instead of paper, and they seem to
have a different adhesive. I thought mine were loose because I had tried
several lubricants on my cube, and the lube. had interacted with the
adhesive; apparently not. Someone who's smart with solvents might be able
to remove all the adhesive, and reattach them with a better adhesive.
CA ("Krazy Glue"; cyanoacrylate) might be good, as might plastic-model
cement. However, one should be careful; a 5^3 is not something to
mistreat!
