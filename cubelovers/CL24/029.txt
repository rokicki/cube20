Subject: New cube program available

I've recently finished my implementation of Kociemba's algorithm and it
is now available from the cube-lovers ftp site at:

ftp.ai.mit.edu /pub/cube-lovers/contrib/kcube1_0.zip

The .zip files contains a README.TXT file, commented C++ source, and
an executable program that runs on Win95/NT.  Here's a brief description
of the program that appears in the README file within the "contrib"
directory:

File: kcube1_0.zip
Author: Greg Schmidt <Greg.Schmidt@ab.com>
Description:

    A cube solver that implements Kociemba's algorithm.  This program was
    written for the express purpose of understanding the algorithm in
    sufficient detail for me to implement it.  The source code is included
    and commented with the hope of providing others with a similar
    understanding.


I welcome feedback concerning any aspects of this program.  Many thanks to
Dik Winter and especially Herbert Kociemba for answering some of my
detailed questions as well as allowing me to use their ideas and offer
them to cube-lovers in the form of this program.

Regards,

-- Greg
