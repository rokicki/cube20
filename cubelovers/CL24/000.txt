Subject: Got a new shape...?

On 8/15/97 David Goyra asked for ideas for simulated puzzles.

Obviously there are infinite possibilities.  If you want a source of
inspiration for simulated or real puzzles, I recommend the following
book:

Shapes, Space and Symmetry
by Alan Holden
Dover Publications, Inc.

I got mine at Boarders Bookstores.  It is a book about three dimensional
shapes.  It discusses symmetry and other properties with a minimum of
mathematical terms.  It gives instructions (and pictures) on
constructing many shapes from cardboard or wire.

Any solid shape could be cut (or cuts) parallel to the sides, between
opposite corners, between opposite edges, along edges or any combination
of the foregoing.  You will see the shapes of the common puzzles and
ideas for hundreds more.
