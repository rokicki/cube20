Subject: Piece for a Rubik's Revenge

Hi Everyone,

Does anyone know of someone wanting to sell a BROKEN Rubik's Revenge?
or maybe a center piece from the same?

Did anyone else have problems with the center pieces breaking on their
RR?  or am I the only one?

My RR has been sitting useless on the shelf since '84.  Hey, I was young
and careless. ;-)
