[ Moderator's note--The subject is misleading, because I erroneously 
  titled Digest v23 #171 as "4x4x4 solutions".  It was actually about
  "Pieces of broken cubes"--the discussion of breakability and the idea
  of trading pieces of cubes.  I regret the error. ]

5Xs are pretty stable; each side has a fixed center piece (i.e. like a 3X).
I've had three and never had any problem with any of them.

4Xs are another ballgame altogether.  Since they don't have a fixed center,
they depend on an internal configuration, consisting of a cluster of four
plates, to hold the faces on.

Each of these plates is held on with a screw and this adjustment is
_critical_.  Too  tight and it can be all but impossible to twist the
faces; too loose and the cube tends to dissolve in your hands.

I've owned four; one was fine, one was OK/usable, one was too stiff to use
and one couldn't be kept together.  So, the "usability" rate was approx
1/3.  (OTOH I picked them all up for $2/ea at a ToysRU clearance...)
