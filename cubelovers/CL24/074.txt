In front of me I hold a cube from one of the first batches from Hungary
with the following colour arrangement:

Up = white
Down = yellow
Front = blue
Back = green
Left = red
Right = orange

Does anybody know the history why this colour arrangement was changed?

BTW: Even if Ideal Toys has their own local standard, it doesn't change
the original ("correct") colour arrangement.
