Invention is more or less possible.  Surely someone like the famous
Mr. Wu (whose given names I've forgotten) would be able to invent it.
But if it happened, surely it would be hard to say who came first.

As for patenting, somehow the mixture of "patent" and "Taiwan" in the
same sentence strikes me as an oxymoron.

>A trademark?

Somehow the mixture of "trademark" and "Taiwan" strikes me as an
oxymoron too, even though they're not in the same sentence.
Want to try "copyright" next?  :-)
