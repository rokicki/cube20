I've had this problem as well. If I understand you correctly, this
problem simply doesn't occur anymore as soon as you number (or mark in
any other way) the center pieces which
a) makes solving the cube a bit more difficult
b) makes sure that you'll always get back to the original
configuration of center pieces.

I've had a similar problem on my 5x5x5 as well, and I assume that
marking the nine center pieces might solve the problem as well.
On my 4x4x4 I also had a problem of having two pairs of edges
exchanged which simply can't happen on a 3x3x3. By experimenting with
3x3x3 moves I found a 24move solution to this, and I wonder if that's
also sort of automatically solved by marking center pieces.

Can anyone confirm this?
