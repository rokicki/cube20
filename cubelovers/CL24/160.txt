	   Not only did they want the word 'Rubik'
   removed from the website, they wanted one of
   the Java puzzles removed as well. They called it
   an "electronic version of the RUBIK'S CUBE".
   Fair enough, being a hexahedron sliced into 26
   equal parts it bore a certian visual resemblance,
   but obviously there was none of their mechanism
   involved. It was all brand-new software.

This latter seems totally outrageous to me.  If I were in your shoes, I
would consider contacting the EFF to see if they were interested in making
a case out of this.  The request that you remove Rubik's name from your
site is the kind of petty stupidity we're seeing all to often these days,
and is probably pretty mundane to the cyberlawyers at EFF, but the notion
that they can torpedo your software if it merely duplicates the user
interface (the "look-and-feel") of their physical puzzle might be something
genuinely new.  Heck, do these guys claim that they own the underlying
mathematical group?
