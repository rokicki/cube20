They have to say stuff like this to demonstrate that they've protected
their trademark.  Apparently the word "Rubik", when applied to puzzles,
is trademarked.  In US law, if one doesn't protect a trademark by this
manner, one may lose it.

Of course, since Rubik is also the name of a person, you should be able to
use "Rubik" when referring to the person.  The specific thing they're
worried about is phrases like "The Rubik Page" or "Rubik Puzzles."
Change the wording to "Puzzles based on those invented by Erno Rubik,"
and I don't think they can touch you.

This is bunk.  No one can trademark that stuff.  At most, there's a patent
(which you can't have violated).  The lawyers are just asking for extra.
