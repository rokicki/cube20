This is a recently re-issued version of the Megaminx, using 6 colors
instead of 12. This puzzle is available at
Spielkiste <http://www.twfg.de/puzzle/default.htm>
The original Meffert Megaminx, however, used 12 colors, and the same
goes for a slightly different hungarian version called Supernova.
Christoph Bandelow <Christoph.Bandelow@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> still has a
few of the latter for sale.

This indeed is caused by the fact that in this version of the puzzle
there exist 15 (not 10) pairs of edges that are alike. Thus solving the
puzzle is somewhat similar to solving Alexander's Star and Impossiball
at the same time!
