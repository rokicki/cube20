It's kind of difficult to find the Cubes in Toy's R Us but they are there.
They also have some new game out for two people, but I don't remember what
it's called.  I know that the cubes are not where you would expect them to
be, with other games and puzzles, they are normally on an end cap near the
front of the stores on the bottom shelf.  Also a lot of the other toy
stores have them and they all have them in strange places around the store.

I don't think that I have seen anything new besides the new game.  They
normally sell the cube, snake, magic rings, and a pyramid that comes apart
and you put back together.
