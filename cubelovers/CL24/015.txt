Subject: 4x4x4 solution

i recently borrowed a friends 4x4x4, and i know the basic method for
solving it.  ie get the 6 centres, pair up all the edges, and then
solve for the normal cube.  however, about half the time i end up
with a single edge pair inverted and cant figure out a move for
reorientating the single edge pair.  usually i break a few pairs
and try and reorientate them this way, but this seems rather longwinded...
does anyone have a move for this?.  for example, say the green edge
is on the blue face, and the blue edge is on the green face...

thanks.
