I'm glad my comments regarding MEGAMINX seemed to have sparked interest.
As someone points out, and as I realised over the weekend, there are of
course 15 pairs of `twin' edges, not 10 as I stated before.  Of course the
conjecture I made (suggested by one correspondent to be true, but well
beyond my group theory) would mean there are then 2^{15-1} = 16384
`distinct' complete solutions to this version of the puzzle!

I'll ask my friend where he got the MEGAMINX and the instruction booklet
from.  He said there were a fair few other similar puzzles there as well.
