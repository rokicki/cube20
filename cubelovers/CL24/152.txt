>I just heard there's a new puzzle out in the U.S. called "Lights Out Cube".

Yes the cube is by the makers of Lights Out.  It is available here in the
U.S. at places like Target and Wal-Mart.  It's quite a conversation piece
because people often ask if it's an electronic Rubik's Cube!  Of course it's
just a 3-D version of the Lights Out game.  It's fun because the puzzles get
progressively more difficult, plus there is a multi-player mode.
