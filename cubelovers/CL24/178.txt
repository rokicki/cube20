Is it possible to copyright the Cube?  That's why I didn't try it.

In any case, stop sneering -- Taiwan has local copyright, trademark,
and patent laws, and has had them for decades.  Sure, they haven't
honored international copyright laws, but then again, most
other countries don't think Taiwan exists as an independent
country.  When it became economically viable to honor international
copyright, they did so -- such legislation was passed in 1994.

Perhaps you are getting a biased view from living in Japan?
