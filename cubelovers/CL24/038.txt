I guess my terminology was incorrect.  The parts I need are actually the
center cubies of which there are 4 on each side (for a total of 24).  It
sounds like Joe McGarity's broken RR will help me out just fine (as will
a couple of other responses I've received).

I got to looking last night and found that I actually need 3 (not just
1) of these center cubies.
