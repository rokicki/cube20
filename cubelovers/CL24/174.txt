I have heard through multi-generation, unreliable sources that the Cube
was first invented and patented by a Taiwanese person.  This story
strikes me as strongly false, but perhaps may have some basis 
somewhere.  Any guesses?  Perhaps a particularly different sort of
mechanism was patented?  A trademark?
