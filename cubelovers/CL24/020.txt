It is possible to solve the problem with a sequence based on a quarter
turn of a central slice, since that, like a swap of two edge pieces,
involves an odd-parity cycle of the edge pieces.  Thus

	r2 U2 r U2 r2

(where r is the turn of the inner slice next to R in the direction
parallel to R)

puts a 4-cycle of edges onto the top face, but leaves you with the task
of restoring the centres.
It was the desire to find something less cumbersome that first lead me
to investigate the archives of this list, and there the answer was:

It does indeed contain an odd number of turns of the central slices to
give the desired parity.
