Subject:  What is the smallest cube which has all possible types of pieces?

Some cube discussion has started in rec.games.misc.  I am trying to
re-direct it to rec.puzzles, or hopefully cube-lovers.

This is a copy of what I posted to rec.games.misc and rec.puzzles.

Actually the 7x7x7 has a type of piece that the 5x5x5 does not have.
This is a "face" piece which is not on a main diagonal of the face, nor
on the main horizontal or vertical.  These pieces come in 2 flavors,
right-handed and left-handed (but I am not sure which should be called which).

----------------------
|A |B |C |D |  |  |  |      The 2x2x2 has types A
----------------------      The 3x3x3 has types A, D, K
|  |E |F |G |  |  |  |      The 4x4x4 has types A, B(C), E(I)
----------------------      The 5x5x5 has types A, B(C), D, E(I), G(J), K
|  |H |I |J |  |  |  |      The 6x6x6 has types A, B, C, E, F, H, I
----------------------      The 7x7x7 has types A-K
|  |  |  |K |  |  |  |
----------------------      B and C are distinct at size 6+, but the same
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |          sorts of procedures work on both.
----------------------      Similarly for E & I.
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |      Similarly for G & J.  For odd sizes 7+.
----------------------      Similarly for H & F. These are related
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |          by mirror imaging.  Not by slice renumbering,
----------------------          like the above.

Types F & H only start appearing at size 6.  There are 24 of each of these
pieces, and a type F can not be mixed with a type H.


Discussions about the Rubik's cube and related puzzles should probably be
directed to rec.puzzles rather than rec.games.misc.

There is also a mailing list for theses topics.

Some sites may also see this as a newsgroup mlist.cube-lovers. But do not
post to this group.

Actually the 7x7x7 is also the first cube that can not be made.

But, all of E to J can be solved with the same set of procedures %.  So
although there appear to be 7 essentially different cubelets, actually
there are only 5.  And the 5x5x5 cube has them all.  Solving these involves
rotating the three slices they are in originally.  So if we rename cubelet
types we get:
1:  A
2:  B&C
3:  D
4:  E-J
5:  K
and we find for the different cubes:
2x2x2:	Type 1
3x3x3:	Type 1, 3 and 5
4x4x4:	Type 1, 2 and 4
5x5x5:	All types.
--
%  All of E to J occur 4 times on each face, so for each type there are 24
   cubelets.  B and C also occur 24 times, procedures working for these
   two also work for E to J (although I use different procedures both on
   4x4x4 and 5x5x5); but there are procedures for E to J that do not work
   for B to C (these two have more constraints on position).  This would be
   different if the cube was patterned such that all cubelets of type B, C
   and E to J had a unique position, in that case we would have only four
   essentially different types.

I made essentially the same assertion some months back (about the 5x5x5
being the last "interesting" cube), and someone pointed out that there
is a position in even order cubes which has no parallel in odd order cubes--
that where all the corner cubies are correct, but all the edge cubies on
the top layer are wrong.  The presence of the fixed center cubie makes it
clear that the edge cubies are really all wrong.

Boy it's great to get cube mail again.

Subject: Square One


Hi everyone!

Well, now I finally had time to try and solve my Square One. After 
hours and hours of pondering it is now finally done. (For the first time ever -
I noticed the leaflet with instructions on how to get it to square one only
after I'd done a few rotations.) Now what needs to be done is to polish
the 'method' a bit (a lot), and find out if I was just lucky this time...

Altogether, it seems to be quite a nice puzzle, although at first I thought
that it was _very_ ugly and unpleasant. (But not half as ugly and unpleasant as
'Rubik's Dice'. Perhaps I'm clumsy, but It's awful: whenever I get
somewhere with it, I touch it a bit too hard, all the plates fall to the
bottom and I throw the thing back to the corner in disgustment. Opinions?)

But: does anyone have the number of configurations for it? I tried to count
them, and got something like 2.8 E 13, but very probably there are a few
factors of two or something missing. It's also a bit tricky to decide on when
two configurations are different. (I mean, should one count as different a
configuration reached by rotating, say, the top layer by 30 degrees? Sometimes,
yes, but sometimes it seems a bit funny to do so.)

Jeff,

I have looked into this somewhat.  As far as I know, the symmetries of
the 3^3 cube are just the symmetries of the cube, but in larger sizes
we can do better.  The best way of looking at this is to imagine that
there is a (N-2)^3 cube sitting inside your N^3 cube, and smaller
cubes within, and you are trying to solve them all together.

Suppose we address each cubelet of the N^3 cube using cartesian
coordinates (x,y,z), where (0,0,0) is the center of the cube (for N
odd) and no cubelets have any coordinate zero if N is even.  The
maximum absolute value of the coordinates is [N/2].

Then for 1<=I<=[N/2], there is a symmetry
 F[I]:(x,y,z)->(f(x),f(y),f(z)),
where f(I)=-I, f(-I)=I, and f(x)=x otherwise.

Then for 1<=I<J<=[N/2], there is a symmetry
 E[I,J]:(x,y,z)->(e(x),e(y),e(z)),
where e(I)=J, e(J)=I, e(-I)=-J, e(-J)=-I, and e(x)=x otherwise.

These are symmetries of the cube group, and they map elementary moves
to elementary moves (provided we take an elementary move to be a
rotation of the slab of N^2 cubelets that have a particular nonzero
value of a particular coordinate).  Symmetries of the cube group that
preserve elementary moves are useful in the study of local minima in
the cube group.

It turns out that if you only want to consider the outside of the cube
(ignoring the (N-2)^3 cube inside) all of these symmetries are still
present except F[[N/2]] and E[I,[N/2]].

I mentioned these symmetries in a note to the Cube-Lovers mailing list
in 1983.  I called E[I,J] evisceration, F[1] inflection, and F[[N/2]]
exflection in that note (where I was dealing explicitly with only the
4^3).  The discussion of the relation to local minima took place in
1980.  Let me know if you'd like a copy of these messages.

I ran into these symmetries earlier, though.  They are symmetries of
the N^3 tic-tac-toe board!  I would not be surprised if they arise in
some other connection in mathematics, but I have never run into them.
They generalize into larger dimensions, as well.

I've also taken the liberty of Cc'ing the Cube-Lovers list with this
note.  If you'd like to be on that list, you may ask of
"Cube-Lovers-Request@AI.AI.MIT.Edu".

SHAPING SPACE; A POLYHEDRAL APPROACH
M Senechal, G Fleck eds.
284 pp, Birkhauser, 1988 
$49.95, ISBN 0-8176-3351-0

REVIEW BY:
  Peter Beck;  Rubik's Cube Collector

Other reviews:
  SCITECH BOOK NEWS, V12, APR 88, P3
  AMERICAN SCIENTIST, V77, JAN 89, P72

Shaping Space, the book, was inspired by the Shaping Space Conference
held at Smith College in April 1984.  The content of the book
addresses itself to an interdisciplinary readership and should be
considered as a cornerstone book in guiding any level of reader on an
exploration of the Polyhedron Kingdom.   It encourages readers to
experience polyhedra directly, by including recipes for construction
as well as numerous illustrations (188 line and 174 halftone
illustrations). 

The book is organized in five parts with parts 1,2 &5 of greater
interest to the beginning explorer.

Part 1 is an introduction to polyhedra which includes a chapter on
making polyhedra ,ie, Chapter 2 "Five Recipes for Making Polyhedra."
Part 2 is an interdisciplinary overview of polyhedra which includes a
chapter on "Milestones in the History of Polyhedra" (chapter 4), a
chapter on "Polyhedra and Crystal Structures" (chapter 5),and a
chapter on "Spatial Perception and Creativity" (chapter 7), and
concludes with a chapter on "Why Study Polyhedra?" (chapter 8).  
Part 3 is about the roles of polyhedra in science. 
Part 4 is the theory of polyhedra. 
Part 5 is a discussion on incorporating the teaching of polyhedra in
the curriculum.  Included in part 5 is a resource guide that is
organized in the following categories:
A.  Architecture
B.  Art
C.  Geometry
D.  Instructional and Recreational Materials
E.  Science
F.  Symmetry

In addition to the resource guide each chapter has its own list of
references.  The book has a comprehensive index of 10 pages and it
also has a list of the conference contributors addresses.

   I was reading through the archives the other night (just signed onto the
mailing list) and one of the last posts in cube-mail-7 triggered something in
me head.
 
   The suggestion was to use a fresnel saw to cut all the cubelets out of
a single chunk of material, with the cut such that the pieces all interlock.
The interlocking however doesn't need to be quite as intricate as the diagram
given - why not a simple dovetail?
 
    That's actually to some extent what the 3x3x3 cube is - the center cubelets
dovetail into the edge cubelets, and the edges dovetail into the corners. It
just happens that there's enough reduncancy that the outside half of the
dovetail joints can be disposed of, and the edges made straight while still
allowing the cube to stay in one piece.
 
    If we have a complete (both sides) locked dovetail, we can actually assemble
almost all of the cube out of the cubelets. Since the cubelets will always
require an entry point for their dovetail grooves, there will be a few cubelets
that have to be attached differently.

    The simplest solution I can think of is to have the dovetail/cublet pair
seperate, with a countersink on the dovetail, and holes through the other
cubelets so that we can screw the dovetails (which are already in their grooves)
onto the last couple of cubelets.

    One drawback with this approach is that the boundaries between layers of
cubelets will be quite jagged. If the dovetails go right to the surface, one
has to be *VERY* careful when turning the cube to make sure that all layers
are lined up in the axes that aren't being turned (this problem plagues the
magic truncated octahedron I have - pieces pop out all the time). The solution
is to make the dovetail taper off at its ends so that if it's out of line with
the groove its going into, it can still correct itself. This will lead to holes
at the surface though, so the cube won't be too pretty.

    A novelty with this approach though is that no centre is required. We
could build a hollow 3x3x3 cube with face centres hollow, and see right
through the cube. This should be possible with larger odd-sized cubes too,
but there comes a point (probably 7x7x7 again) where mechanical play would
let middle layers shear enough to pop out cubelets.

    But, if we had the smaller odd-sized cubes trapped inside, not only
would they help hold the outer layers together, if we made the cubelets 
mostly transparent, we'd be able to see  what we've had to imagine in the
past. Now that'd be one heck of a puzzle.

out (hardcopy).  The form has to be to Jerry by 1/15/92 to be
included.  This is a non-commercial venture and I am unaware of any
extended plans.

To get a form contact Jerry:

Subject: A Sam Loyd Rubik puzzle unearthed!!!
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 91 14:57:25 PST
Sender: ronnie@cisco.com

	An original Sam Loyd puzzle involving the Rubik's cube has
come into my hands; somewhat surprising, in that Sam Loyd died in
the early years of this century, but no more so than the truly
astounding circumstances by which the puzzle came to me, which I would
detail if I believe that anyone were interested.  However, as this
list consists only of people interesting in things Cubic, I will limit
this posting to the puzzle itself.




		Crooked Gambling in Puzzleland

				by Sam Loyd


	Tommy Riddles has challenged King Puzzlepate to a game of
dice, using Rubik's Cubes as dice.  However, Tommy is planning to
cheat by changing the ordinary Rubik's Cube into tops [ tops are dice
which are misspotted, by having only three different numbers on them,
each appearing opposite to itself, such that it is indetectable
without turning the die around  -ed ]  spotted 1-2-3, which he is able
to make from a standard cube in 14 moves.

	King Puzzlepate, however, has learned from the General of his
plans, and has figured out to convert Tommy's tops into 2-3-4 tops,
which are favorable to His Majesty, in only 3 moves.

	Can you duplicate both these feats?


[ Note that Loyd appears to consider a move as moving any of the nine
slices any number of degrees.  Thus the move we would designate as
L2R2 and count as four, Loyd would count as one move of the center
slice by 180 degrees. ]

Hmm.  A likely story.

We are challenged to find ``tops'',

Where he counts a half turn, a slice, and and a half-slices as one
move each.  I have found how this can be done in 13 such moves.  I
have some suspicion that it can be done in 12; I'll let you know.

We are then challenged to convert this

> ... into 2-3-4 tops ... in only 3 moves.

The second part can be solved by any person who achieves mastery of
the cube.

Well, I'm glad that my silly ideas triggered something.  Sometimes I

Certainly a dovetail would do it.  I guess when I got to sharpening
the fresnel saw I didn't know when to quit.

Surprisingly enough, this is just how Rubik's Revenge is put together.
One of the center cubelets (perhaps always on the blue side) has a
screw that joins the outside of the cubelet to its dovetail.  You can
usually find locate it by the dimple in the colored sticker.

In the 7^3 and larger, they have to go through the surface, and even
if they were squared-off dovetails they wouldn't match the color of
the adjacent square except in the solved position.  Unless of
course we make the outer layers thicker, as Dale Newfield mentioned
when we were discussing this back in May.

Wow, I want one!  But I don't think the material really needs to be
transparent, as long as the face center pieces are hollow.  It would
help let light in, though.

Subject: Re: Rubik's cube dice tops (Spoiler)

Last week ronnie@cisco.com (Ronnie Kon) challenged us to find Rubik's
cube patterns with dice pips for 1, 2, and 3 on the three pairs of
opposite sides.  He claimed it could be done in fourteen HST, where
one HST is a turn of a face or center slice by 90 or 180 degrees.  I
responded that it could be done in thirteen HST.  Here is how.  I will
use this opportunity to practice the enhanced Varga Rubiksong I
described (unfortunately with many typos) on 22 Feb 90.

The (only such) pattern is the composition of Four-Spot and Laughter.
We have long known the processes

          ris-fos tis-fos, or (RL)^2 FB' (TD)^2 FB', for Four-Spot and
  fon-ron fon-ron fon-ron, or (FBRL)^3,              for Laughter.

When we compose them, the F and B moves combine and cancel to produce

ris-fos tis-fi ron-fon ron-fon ron, or (RL)^2 FB' (TD)^2 F^2 (RLFB)^2 RL.

This 14 HST process is presumably something like what Ronnie had in
mind.  But since this pattern commutes with ris, or (RL)^2, we can get
the same pattern with the conjugate process

    fos tis-fi ron-fon ron-fon ran, or FB' (TD)^2 F^2 (RLFB)^2 R'L'.

This uses only 13 HST.  This is also the shortest process I know of in
the normal metric: 18 QT, which is not so bad for the combination of
two 12 QT processes.

I suggested that perhaps 12 HST would be sufficient, but I have not
found such an improvement.  Nor do I know whether 13 HST is the best
that can be done: it seems that proving 13 HST optimal would require
examining about 160 million positions, almost as many as the 200
million it would take to prove 18 QT optimal.

Subject:  Hungarian Rings solution?

Does anyone have an algorithm for solving the "Hungarian Rings" they'd
be willing to share.  I found one in a drawer that had been long
misplaced, and I've been fiddling with it some.  It seems easy enough
to find lots of 'commutators' for the thing, but all the ones I've run
into have the annoying property that they produce symmetric
perumtations [given a 180 degree rotation of the puzzle].  But of
course, my puzzle is no where near symmetrically messed up.

Any advice, hints, full-blown algorithm, etc, would be appreciated... Thanks!
 /Bernie\

ps, For those that don't remember it, the "Hungarian Rings" is a puzzle with
beads arranged in two intersecting circles:

	*       *
      *   *   *   *
    *       *       *
  *       *   *       *
 *       *     *       *
  *       *   *       *
    *       *       *
      *   *   *   *
	*       *

[Imagine these both round...:-)]  and you can slide the beads around either
cicle.    The beads come in four colors andthe object is to get the colors
all sorted out.  /b\

You don't nood commutators for it, cycles are sufficient (because there
are so many similar colored beads).  If I remember right one useful move
is:  turn right ring clockwise two beads, turn left clockwise two beads,
turn right anti-clockwise two beads, turn left anti-clockwise two beads.
Using them properly will solve the rings.

I got given one of these things for Christmas (well, actually I gave it
to myself). I was wondering if anyone has any good basic operators that
they would like to share.  I would imagine that the puzzle must be less
complex than a true cube,  but the restricted set of moves make solving
it more complicated than you might think!
[I currently have six corners correct, but I still have two (diagonally
opposite) corners interchanged.  The cube-solving technique that I used
for a real cube doesn't work here - I need something different].

The 'properly' is the part I'm finding hard.   There seem to be LOTS of
cycles, but even with that big choice I can't see, quite, how to solve
the thing.

As far as I can tell, basically ANY set of ring-turns that has a total
movement of zero seems to define a pretty small cycle.  For example,
the sequence LnA RnA LnC RnC, for n not a multiple of 5[*], does a
three-bead cycle: if you look at the upper intersection:
                        A                     C
   Intersection --->  C      ======>        B
                        B                     A
Where 'A' and 'B' are each n beads away from the intersection [and by
changing theorder of L/R you reverse the cycle, and by interchanging A
and C you move the cycle to the other side of the intersection.
BUT: the problem is that this isn't really a 3-cycle, but rahter _two_
3-cycles: you also make a central-symmetric move of the beads at the
bottom intersection.
   [*] since five is the distance between the intersections, if the
   rotate is a muiltiple of 5 the intersections interact, things get a
   little different: it makes a *two* cycle!  In the diagram above
   [with A five away from C], the move just _swaps_ A & C [and the A'
   and C' at the lower intersection, too, of course].

Given that my rings are totally non-symmetrically messed up, I can't
figure out a plan for making forward progress.  I can do lots of
diffent cycles, but I can't manage to get the rings set up so that the
cycle at both intersections is useful: if I try to fix something at the
top intersection I invariably mess up something at the bottom one.

Thanks again for you patience with my rantings.  I feel like I'm
overlooking something simple [since this wasn't supposed to be all that
hard a puzzle], but I don't see what it is ...

I have already been chastised that what I described are commutators.  Of course
they are.  Not only is my thinking bad late at night, but apparently my

True.  But if you prefix the move by a (series of moves) that makes the upper
three of an identical color (and postfix by its inverse), you will not see
the difference between a true cycle.  At least that is how I always did the
final part.  (Correctly coloring the two lobes is in fact easy; you better
start with that.)

      that permits the big 180-degree twist that must follow.
      Note that the angle of turn is not always the same!  Sometimes
      "the smallest increment" turn is truly the smallest possible
      increment, that is, the width of an edge piece.  At other
      times, it may be the width of a corner piece (much larger),
      or even two or three piece's widths combined.

  *  "to match" as in "Turn the back face to match".
     This means the front and back faces remain aligned with one

     degrees, holding the left half fixed.  The logo stays fixed
     in position and orientation, never moving.

  *  To help in describing the effects of these moves, I will
     refer to the pieces by number, as follows.  Here I have
     numbered the pieces clockwise from the upper left corner
     piece on the front face.  I have numbered the back face
     similarly, ** as if looking straight through to it **,
     that is, piece 9 is directly beneath piece 1, piece 10
     is directly beneath piece 2, etc.:

            Front Face               Back Face

            1   2   3                9  10  11
	    8       4               16      12
	    7   6   5               15  14  13


------------------------------------------------------

(1) Swaps all 8 corner pieces diagonally directly across in pairs, staying on
the same faces (front and back).  In my numbering scheme, this move swaps 1
with 5, 3 with 7, 9 with 13, and 11 with 15.

  (a) Turn the front face cw the smallest increment.
      Turn the back face to match.  Now do the 180-degree twist.

  (b) Turn the front face ccw the smallest increment.
      Turn the back face to match.  Now do the 180-degree twist.

  (c) Repeat the (a)(b) combination three times.

  Note:  This entire move, repeated twice, is, of course, an identity.

------------------------------------------------------

(2) Swaps all 8 edge pieces directly across in pairs, staying on the same faces
(front and back).  In my numbering scheme, this move swaps 2 with 6, 4 with 8,
10 with 14, and 12 with 16.

  (a) Turn the front face cw the smallest increment.
      Turn the back face to match.  Now do the 180-degree twist.

  (b) Repeat (a) six times.

  (c) Turn the front and back faces 180 degrees.

  Note:  This entire move, repeated twice, is, of course, an identity.

------------------------------------------------------

(3) Although this move itself is simple to describe, its effect is not. It
moves four pieces (two large and two small) from the front to the back, and
vice-versa.

It's easiest to just give a map of the changes:

BEFORE:     Front Face               Back Face

            1   2   3                9  10  11
	    8       4               16      12
	    7   6   5               15  14  13

AFTER:      Front Face               Back Face

            11  6  13                9  10   3
	     8     12               16       2
	     7 14   1               15   4   5

(Because the back face is never turned in this move, its pieces 9, 10, 15, and
16 always stay fixed.  They are on the immobile half of the back face, the half
not moved during the 180-degree twists.)

  (a) Turn the front face cw the smallest increment.
      Do not turn the back face at all.
      Now do the 180-degree twist.

  (b) Turn the front face ccw the smallest increment.
      Do not turn the back face at all.
      Now do the 180-degree twist.

  (c) Repeat the (a)(b) combination three times.

  Note:  This entire move, repeated five times, is an identity.

	Another miscellaneous thought on the dovetail topic.  The way I
understand it is that each piece is dovetailed into the surrounding pieces. 
I.E. on the 3x3x3 the face-centers are dovetailed into the edges which are
dovetailed into the corners.  Now, the maximum radius of the dovetailing circle
permits this all the way out to 5x5x5, but at 6x6x6, a piece hangs outside the
dovetail radius.
	The master design could work still.  First of all, keep those cubes
nested together.  Second of all, dovetail the inner cubes outward, so the whole
damn thing holds.  Last, and certainly not least, in the case of the 6x6x6, I
think that we can add in another circle of dovetails at the radius which would
support a 7x7x7 cube.

	This is really hard to explain without graphics, but try to imagine
this.  Each dovetail ring will be a simple circle.  Draw a 3x3 grid, and
superimpose a circle with a radius of 1.5 grids.  Now, that will be
the inside of the dovetail, 1/3 of the way into the face.  For a 5x5 grid,
repeat the 3x3 procedure and do the same for the 5x5, except at 2.5 grids
radius.  That represents the next layer of the cube.

	Keeping the original Rubik concept of faces-edges-corners nesting in
mind, we keep building out this way.  It probably will be damn inconvenient to
build the 7x7x7 cube this way, but I am reasonably sure that it will hold
together and still retain all the necessary movements from the original cube. 

	In the case of the 5x5x5 cube, it will look like this:

abcba
bdedb
cefec
bdedb
abcba

a is held by 2 b's.
b is held by c and d.
c is held by e.
d is held by 2 e's.
e is held by f.

The only real weak spot is c, but it is surrounded by b's and an e.

	The 7x7x7 cube will look like this:

abcdcba
befgfeb
cfhihfc
dgijijd
cfhihfc
befgfeb
abcdcba

a is held by 2 b's.
b is held by c and e.
c is held by d and f.
d is held by g.
e is held by 2 f's.
f is held by h and g.
g is held by i.
h is held by 2 i's.
i is held by j.
j is the center.

Again, the problem shows up in d, g, and i.  I think that this is unavoidable,
but since the 3x3x3 cube holds together in much the same way, I think that it
should be about as a 5x5x5 cube is compared to the 3x3x3 cube.  Not much
difference.  The only problem that I have had with my 5x5x5 cube is the edge
cubies, and as I have noted, the middle and third edges should be the problems,
since everything else is buried within a face.

	I haven't built a prototype yet, but once I get finished with this
semester of college (my last one), I intend to start working on this in between
job-hunting and paying off loans.  If anyone is interested in this idea, I
would like to start correspondence on this topic.

	I have some diagrams available, but they don't come over too well in
ASCII.  If you would like a copy of my preliminaries, please E-Mail me at the
following addresses.  Thank you for your consideration.

> Does anybody know what the minimum number of moves are required to

and receives some answers, some of them accurate.  The following is my
understanding of the best answers now known, which I am sending both
to rec.puzzles and the Cube-Lovers mailing list.  The latter will, I
hope, excuse some information repeated from the archives.

First, you have to decide what you mean by a move.  On grounds of
symmetry and parsimony I prefer to count each quarter-turn of a face
as a (QT) move.  However, most of the literature counts either a
quarter-turn or a half-turn of a face as a single (HT) move, and there
has been more work done on the problem by the HT contingent.

Second, you have to be careful to define what constitutes solved!
While most people are content to make each face a solid color, some
cubes have markings that display whether the face centers are twisted
with respect to the rest of the cube.
    [This has recently been done commercially in an spectacularly
     braindamaged way, in a product known as ``Rubik's cube--the
     fourth dimension'' or some such nonsense.  The mfrs have marked
     only four face centers, breaking symmetry while they fail to show
     the surprising invariant of the Supergroup.  What bagbiters!]
But that is a topic for other messages; I will not further discuss the
invisible features of cubes here, save to note that there are more
invisible features in larger cubes, and that if you take them into
account, the cube will be harder to solve and require more moves than
if you don't.

Third, you have to understand that in either case, nobody knows the
exact answer except for the tiny cubes.  It boils down to knowing
lower bounds L and upper bounds U, such that there must be some
positions requiring at least L moves, while any position can be solved
in at most U moves.  I will discuss these in turn, below.

For lower bounds, it is easy to calculate how many positions of
Rubik's cube are achievable, and we may reason that only a few
positions are within a few moves of start.  Counting them, we can
determine that at least 21 QT (or 18 HT) are needed to solve some
positions of the cube.  In fact, at least half of the positions of the
cube require at least 18 HT, and at least 90% of the positions require
at least 20 QT.  The calculations are elementary, and have been known
for over a decade.  Nobody knows any other very good way of finding
lower bounds.  In Rubik's_Cubic_Compendium (1987), Tamas Varga writes
    Experts believe that even in the worst cases--the patterns
    furthest away from start--it should be possible to restore the
    cube in 20-odd [HT] moves, maybe 25, not more.
However, such beliefs are clearly conjectural, based on the behavior
of much simpler puzzles.

The known upper bounds are constructive, consisting of a solution
procedure guaranteed to solve any cube within U moves.  The best known
bound is embodied in a procedure invented by Morwen B. Thistlethwaite,
and improved by students of Donald E. Knuth (The students are not
identified in R_C_C).  The improved procedure requires at most 50 HT
in the worst case.  Thistlethwaite was hoping (in 1980) to improve
this to 41 HT, but (rumors to the contrary) he apparently did not
succeed.  A 1989 article by Hans Kloosterman entitled ``Rubik's Cube
in 44 moves'' refers to an attempt to refine Thistlethwaite's method.
I have not heard of any success there, either.

Since any HT is at most 2QT, any Rubik's cube position can be solved
in at most 100 QT using Thistlethwaite's method.  According to my
understanding of the method, this can actually be reduced to 97 QT,
but this is still poor.  A method tailored to minimizing QT would
almost certainly guarantee a much shorter solution.

Unfortunately, Thistlethwaite's method requires enormous tables of
partial solution methods.  Gerszon Keri describes a simpler method in
R_C_C that requires at most 97 HT and which humans can memorize.  The
method is attributed to ``a Cambridge group,'' which I think must
refer to England.  According to Keri the Cambridge method has been
refined to use only 79 HT, but I do not know if the refined version is
still humanly comprehensible.

For the 2x2x2 cube, the worst-case number of moves is known to be
exactly 14 QT (11 HT).  Only 276 (2644) positions require all 14 QT
(11 HT).  Half of the positions can be solved in 11 QT (9 HT) or
fewer.

For the 4x4x4 and larger cubes, the problem of defining a move is more
complicated.  Besides the QT/HT dichotomy, there is the question of
whether a move consists of a slice (turning one part of the cube with
respect to the other) or a slab (turning a 1x4x4 section of the cube
with respect to the rest).  We might expect that, as we do not count
the center-slab moves of the 3x3x3 as a single move, we should not
count the inner-slab moves of the 4x4x4 as a single move.  However, I
have discovered excellent reasons of symmetry (send email if you want
to know) for us to consider all slabs alike, whether internal or face,
with the exception of the center slab of an odd-sized cube.  This is
known as the Eccentric Slabist metric.

According to my calculations of some years ago, some 4x4x4 positions
require at least 37 slab QT or 41 slice QT to solve.  The Eccentric
Slabist also calculates at least 59, 81, 111, 138, 175, and 208 QT for
the 5x5x5 through 10x10x10 cubes.  (And yes, I've heard the widespread
misinformation that Rubik's cubes larger than six cubies on an edge
are impossible).

I seem to recall calculating HT lower bounds, but I can't seem to find
them.  I do not recall whether upper bounds have been calculated for
the large cubes, other than that they are O(N^2)--see J. A. Eidswick's
article in the March 1986 Math Monthly.

Well, this is the information from Singmaster's _Notes_on_Rubik's_
_Magic_Cube_ (1980).  Thistlethwaite's method is to work from group to
subgroup as follows:

    G0: <F,B,L,R,T,D>
    G1: <F^2,B^2,L,R,T,D>
    G2: <F^2,B^2,L^2,R^2,T,D>
    G3: <F^2,B^2,L^2,R^2,T^2,D^2>
    G4: <I>

The following table shows the number of cosets (the index of each
subgroup in the next larger group).  Then I include the number of HT
moves proven, anticipated, and best possible, from the 1980 N_o_R_M_C.
Finally, I include the number of HT claimed in the 1987 R_C_C.  It is
interesting to note that the improvement did not occur where
Thistlethwaite anticipated it.

Step | Number of Cosets  |     Number of HT, 1980      | #HT, 1987
     |                   |  Proven  Anticipated  Best  |   Proven
     |                   |                             |
  1  | G0:G1 =     2,048 |     7        7         7    |      7 
  2  | G1:G2 = 1,082,565 |    13       12        10    |     13
  3  | G2:G3 =   663,552 |    15       14 ?      13 ?  |     15
  4  | G3:G4 =    29,400 |    17       17        15 ?  |     15
-----+-------------------+-----------------------------+-----------
               Total HT  |    52       50 ?      45 ?  |     50
               Total QT  |   101       97 ?      87 ?  |     97

I had thought the tables contained one entry for each coset, and so
there would be over a million entries for step 2.  However, I was
surprised just now to notice in N_o_R_M_C that tables were only needed
in step 4, and then only 172 entries, so there must be some
abbreviation or algorithmic approach.  Of course, when Knuth's
students improved step 4, they may have changed it to use a huge
lookup table; I don't know.  Still, this is much better than the
situation I expected in my note two days ago.

In listing QT I assume that in we can require steps 1, 2, and 3 to
each end with a quarter-turn.  So the number of QT is at most three
less than twice the number of HT.

The bibliography in N_o_R_M_C mentions Thistlethwaite's algorithms as
being in typescript, but I don't know if they were available by
request, and I don't know anyone who has them.  I don't know anything
about the improvements by Knuth's students, and there's nothing in
the R_C_C bibliography that looks like a Stanford tech report.

I would like to see us develop a programming language for expressing
cube-solving algorithms in.  Then we could cooperate in trying to find
an algorithm with smaller and smaller numbers of moves in the worst
case.

I just completed an exercise I have wanted to try for a while, a rough
worst-case analysis of my own technique.  It's pretty scary.  It turns
out that my worst case is 236 qtw.  My algorithm is "bottom-heavy" -- it
starts with "intuitive" moves for fixing the first few corners.  These
were the hardest to analyze, but they take the fewest moves.  It
finishes up with great big macros for the last few fiddles and fixes.
For example, flipping two edges in place takes 22 qtw.  Obviously a lot
could be gained from tweaking the earlier part of the algorithm to
guarantee that I don't need to do this at the end.

I just wrote a quick program to count the number of QT to move from
the full cube group to the subgroup generated by <F^2,B^2,L,R,T,D>.
Thistlethwaite computed that this takes at least 7 HT in the worst
case.  The surprisingly good result is that it also takes only 7 *QT*
in the worst case.  This reduces the upper bound I posted Friday to 91
QT.

I had wondered if the worst cases could be reduced by choosing a
different pair of faces to restrict to half-twists.  Unfortunately,
the all-edges-flipped position is one of those that requires at least
7 HT (and so 7 QT), and by symmetry it cannot be improved.

Allan C. Wechsler <ACW@YUKON.SCRC.Symbolics.COM> analyzed his own
cube-solving method, finding that:

> For example, flipping two edges in place takes 22 qtw.

This can be done in 16 QT, though I don't know if that is the best
known.  Any pair can be flipped with a conjugate of the 14 QT slice
mono-op FOTAROFATO-RAM TAFORATOFA-ROM (FT'RF'T L'R B'TR'BT' LR').
Adjacent and antipodal pairs require the introduction of a
non-cancelling QT in the conjugator.

> Obviously a lot could be gained from tweaking the earlier part of
> the algorithm to guarantee that I don't need to do this at the end.

Probably, but it's hard to make that guarantee.  The problem is that
unless you flip edges in place with no other action (the very problem
you're trying to avoid) you may affect the later choices in the
algorithm, making the earlier tweaks wrong for that branch of the
algorithm.

For instance, the 7-QT method my program found solves the orientation
of all the edges (using a particular non-standard labeling of the
orientation that, when solved, is invariant under F^2, B^2, L, R, T,
and D).  But it may permute edges, and permute and twist corners, so
it may not form a useful part of an arbitrary cube-solving algorithm.
It works in Thistlethwaite's only because he is careful in all
branches of the rest of the algorithm never to mix up the orientation
of those edges.

If anyone is interested, I wrote a program for examining the cycle
structure of various move sequences on Rubik's cube.  It's got
a lex and yacc front end, which let you enter moves using the
UDLRFB notation.  You give it a move sequence, and it will give
you the permutation in cycle notation, taking edge flips and
corner twists into account.  For example, you can say
  (R'D2R B'U2B)2
which is a corner twister, and it will tell you that the urf corner
is twisted clockwise, and the dlb corner is twisted clockwise.  YOu
can also give names to sequences, and refer to the sequence by its
name.  You can save and load named sequences from a file.

The code is pretty quick-and-dirty, but I'll email the source to
anyone who is interested.  I wrote it on a PC with Microsoft C 5.1, and
flex and bison, but it should work fine under Unix.

Regarding the meta-approach of descending through a series of subgroups,
how much leverage does properly selecting the chain give you?  It seems
like the jump from <F2,B2,...> to <F2,B2,L2,R2,...> is pretty large.
There are probably other paths through the subgroup lattice.

Does anyone have a table of subgroups?

I have recently read a book entitled
	"Learning To Solve Problems By Searching For Macro Operators"

	by Richard E. Korf (exact spelling not in my head).

In a nutshell the book discusses an algorithmic method of problem soving
by discovering useful operators.  The method was applied to the 3D Rubik
cube and as I remember managed on average to solve the problem in about
37 - 38 QTW.  Apparently it was slightly better than human experts.  The
tables discovered by the program weren't terribly large :-)!

Also either in that book or another I remember an approach to the minimove
problem based on measuring the disorderedness of the cube after n random
moves.  The measure of disorder was based on the number of correct colours
on each face or something like that.  From a graph of this measure averaged
over (I suppose) some number of trials it seems as though the cube can be
maximally disordered in around 18 moves.  It would seem that this means
that on average the cube should be restorable in about the same number of
moves.

Of course this doesn't help giving tight bounds,  but I guess it gives
some hope to the clever guys.

As an aside I have something called  a Supernova which is dodekahedral
(i.e. has 12 5 sided faces each of which can rotate) which is alledged
to be 10power 43 more complicated than the 3cube.  I can solve it using
fairly standard cube methods (only the last face is slightly difficult)
in about 20 times my 3-bube time.  Has anyone else seen this and or is
there any standard notation + information on this thing.

Subject: Rubik's Magic Clock & Triamid
Message-Id: <CMM.0.88.695552892.gkomatsu@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu>

...hmm new to this list, been reading some of the postings and things just
seem to go *FOOM*, right over my head.  But it didn't stop me from asking
these.....

Rubik's Magic Clock.
	Sister is Japan sent me this for Christmas (Have still yet to
translate the instructions...as if I need it!) and solved it in a day... Well,
more like "stumbled" upon the solution after a day of fiddling with it.  But
I continued to play with it, and came upon this.....
	Sometimes when I give one of the wheels a good quick "flick", one of
the gears inside slips.  Result is one (or maybe two) of the clock faces
affected is an hour "behind" (or ahead) of the others.  Deep in my mind I
concluded that this rendered the puzzle unsolveable.  And I ended up pulling
out a screwdriver and readjusting the face (or I just "zeroed" all of them.)
Was I correct in this conclusion?
	(...oh yea, she sent this for Christmas '88, not this past year.  I'm
not THAT behind the times!  THIS Christmas I recieved.....)

Rubik's Triamid.
	In the instructions it says,

       "It is physically possible to dismember Triamid into it's
	10 constituent elements and reassemble it into a complete
	Triamid.  A word of warning however--as there are 2 possible
	ways of doing this (a right and a left one) solving the
	puzzle after such a ressembly has an additional sting in
	the tail."

	What exactly is this "sting"?  And what did it mean by "right and
left"?  (if there's some joke here, I missed it...)  I was wondering, if I
took it apart and reassembled it to a completed form, the puzzle is still
solvable, I just scramble it and get back to the form I reassembled it to.
So this can't be the "sting" mentioned.  Unless it meant reassemble it to some
unfinished form.
	Next question... Sometimes when I play around with it, one of the
corner pieces pops off and lands on the floor.  I pick it up and put it back
on wondering, how was it originally oriented?  And considering the 11/12
chance that I'll have put it back on wrong way.  Have I just rendered the
Triamid (once again) "unsolveable"?
	Final question, for fun...  Anyone bought more than one Triamid, and
put 'em together to make a "Monster(a)mid"? =^)

	...also for a Square-1 for x-mas too, still fiddling around with it
too.  And have yet to lay my hands on Rubik's Tangle, Dice, and Fifteen.  But
NOT the Cube^4 (was that it?) Couls never solve the original, why should I
touch this one?  =^/

I haven't tried the Triamid or Tangle, but I bought the Fifteen and the Dice.
I'm still thinking of attacking the Fifteen, but I really hate the Dice after
I twice had gotten four of the faces in their right places, knocked the thing
a bit too much, which caused the plates to fall to the bottom. I hate that 
**** thing and won't touch it again for a long time!

here's a shorter way.  in the "flubrd" notation, use:

              D' F^2 R U^2 F^2 B^2 D^2 R^2 L' F^2 U' D^2

which is 11 "HST" (which i call "slice turns").  this is also 12
"face" turns, but 20 quarter turns.  this can also be done in only 14
quarter turns as follows:
                            F^2 U D F B U D F B U D F B'     (*)

note that this can easily be obtained from the well-known manuever for
"laughter":
                              ( F B  C_U )^6                (**)

where  C_  means "turn the whole cube" (as in Bandelow's book).  note
that this manuever reorients the cube.  then manuever (*) is just the
"flubrd" translation of the manuever  M_F (**) M_F'  (without the cube
reorientation), where  M_  means "turn the middle slice," again, as in
Bandelow's book.

here's a question for those out there with 5x5x5 cubes: have you
noticed that the stickers seem to be more happy on the floor than on
the facelets of the cube?  the more i use my cube, the more restless
they seem to become.  does anyone know of a good cure for this?  i'm
thinking of taking them all off, cleaning off the glue (or gum or
whatnot) and gluing them back on, using a stronger glue.  anyone have
any suggestions for what kind of glue?  i'll let you know how my
experiment works.

There hasn't been any response to this, seemingly, which is a pity.

In any event, I would like to know of any other well-known subgroups.
There are the slice group; double-slice group; U group; square group;
anti-slice group. How many others are there not mentioned here, that 
people know of ?

What's UP

-  GAMES magazine is sponsoring 
  "WORLD PUZZLE TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS" 
   in NYC June 24-28;  registration forms in 
   April issue of GAMES, on newsstands march 1


-  NEW PUZZLE
It is called "PYRIX" (retails for $10, 
   I do not have a retail source) and is from: 
   Enpros Novelty Products, Lorentzstraat 2, 
   2912 AH Niewerkerk aan den IJssel,
   The Netherlands -  
   tel 31 (0)1803-19133

DESCRIPTION:  The puzzle is an assembly folding
  puzzle based on a size 3 tetrahedron.  The 
  tetrahedron is dissected into 3 regular octahedrons
  and 11 tetrahedrons (1/3 the size of the original).
  These pieces are strung on a thread like a necklace;
  an octahedron, 3 tetras, an octahedron, etc except
  for one position that has only 2 tetras.  The octahedrons
  are threaded on the diagonal of their square cross section.
OBJECT:  The faces are colored and the object is to not 
  only assemble a tetra but of course to do it with solid
  colored faces,  the enclosure says that there are 
  2 solutions as they have colored and strung the pieces.
PRELIMINARY REVIEW:  It took about 1 hour.  The puzzle 
  is awkward to manipulate since it falls apart easily.
  Doing it on a flat surface and using tape to hold it
  together seems to be the trick.

well, it's been kicking around in both rec.puzzles and sci.math lately.
maybe you should ask if anyone has heard any follow-up to the above.
i've sent away to the dutch cubists' club for membership and info,
but they want payments in the form of international money orders
(which probably means a good month or two delay).
if/when i have some more info on this, i'll gladly share it with
cube-lovers.

Subject:  Some solutions to Rubik's Tangle have been found.
To: Cube-Lovers@ai.mit.edu

(No spoilers are included)

I now know two distinct solutions to Rubik's Tangle.
Each of these solutions can be done with each 5x5 set, 1-4.

I have not yet found any solutions to the 10x10 puzzle. I do know
that if the 10 by 10 is composed of four 5x5 solutions, than my solutions
of the 5x5 do not lead to a solution of the 10x10. I am now seeking a
solution where all 100 pieces can be used anywhere in the 10x10, not just in
a corner of the 10x10 for its own 5x5 set.

Unfortunately, these solutions were found by brute force, not by any
real calculation.  I have not been able to discover any "Science" about
the puzzle which contributes to any discovery of a solution.

These solutions were found by hand, not by a computer search. So there may be
other solutions to the basic puzzle which are still unknown.
My search path has approximately 750 cases in it, of which I have
tested about 300.  One solution was found by 'accident' in that I have not
yet looked at the case which actually yields that solution, but one of the
test cases had been 'close' to a solution, so I looked outside my search path.
The other solution was found in my search path, so it was not found by
accident. (except by luck that it was at case 300 not 750)

GENERAL THOUGHTS ON RUBIK'S TANGLE AS A PUZZLE
In short, it is not a good puzzle.  It will never be popular.
Solutions might only be findable by Computer, by Luck, and by Stubborness
(brute-force).
As far as I can tell the only real method of solution is by using a computer.
I did it by hand because I am stubborn, and I did get lucky.
My search path contained 750 cases, but I had already considered search paths
with an estimated 4000 and 8000 cases. These are so large that I had never
even completed the basic enumeration of cases.
A hand search of this magnitude is almost impossible.  There are too many
places for errors, and no real ways of checking.  The amount of time is also
absurd.  I worked on between 1 and 8 of my test cases at a time, with
about 250 of these groups in my search path. (later in
the search I would have, on ocassion, looked at 16 at once).  Sometimes a
group could be disposed of within 20 minutes, but sometimes it took several
hours.

Has anybody discovered more mathematical content than I have?

In addition to being self-contradicting (and misspelled), the above seems
to have nothing to do with the subject of Rubik's Tangle.

Lest this message suffer the same flaw, I'll add that I too was unable to
come up with any mathematical or intuitive method for solving the Tangle.
I solved mine by computer.  (I've always been fairly good at finding ways
to prune a bushy search tree down to manageable size.)  I have Tangle #1
and can confirm it has exactly two solutions (ignoring overall rotations
of the 5x5 array, of course).

I haven't had a chance to examine closely the other Tangles.  How do they
differ from #1?  Do they use a different pattern of connectivity on the
tiles?  Do they have a different mix of the permutations?  (#1 has each
4-color permutation exactly once, except for one permutation which appears
twice.)  I hope they do not simply permute the colors relative to #1; that
would be dull since they would then be identical puzzles, and collecting
more than one would be silly except for the purpose of building the 10x10
combined puzzle.

I hope I'm not wasting too many people's time, but... can you describe
the Rubik's Tangle puzzle for those of us who haven't seen it?  Your
description was interesting, but I wonder about your statement that it
can't be solved without a computer.  Perhaps you just didn't have the

I would love to hear an insight that makes this puzzle tractible in real
time (hours rather than days) by hand.  Here's a brief description of
Tangle #1; as I said in my earlier posting, I don't know how the other 3
differ, though I'm pretty sure they each have the same number of tiles.

Tangle #1 consists of 25 square tiles, each of which has four colored
ropes crossing it in the following pattern.  (Note: This may be mirror
imaged, since I'm working from memory.)

	---------------------
	|     @       #     |
	|     @       #     |
	|$$    @      # %%%%|
	|  $    @    %#%    |
	|   $    @ %% #     |
	|    $    %@  #     |
	|    $  %%  @@#     |
	|    %%%      #@@   |
	|%%%% $       #  @@@|
	|     $       #     |
	|     $       #     |
	---------------------

The connection marked with $ actually wanders around the tile a bit more,
but the connectivity is as shown.  The object is to place the tiles in a
5x5 array such that wherever two tiles touch the colors of the ropes match.
In Tangle #1 each permutation of colors occurs once, with one permutation
occurring twice.

The box says that if you get all four Tangles, you can put them together
to make a 10x10 array under the same color-matching constraints.

Tangle 1        Blue    Red     Yellow  Green

Tangle 3        Green   Yellow  Blue    Red
Tangle 4        Red     Green   Yellow  Blue

All 4 Tangles are the same puzzle, just colored differently.
Each has all 24 color permutations, plus a duplicate.

Each Tile also has a letter (A-Y) on the back, and a reference to the
Tangle that it occurs in.  These letters appear to be for reference
only.  I have found no corresponddence between the letterings in one
puzzle, and the letterings in another.  I just use them as a convenience
for recording configurations, and sorting through the tiles.

Subject: an upper bound on god's number

in an earlier message, i promised to pass along any information
i obtained about progress on the upper bound for the length of
god's algorithm.  i've received a copy of the article "rubik's
cube in 42 moves" by hans kloosterman, which i summarize below.

first here are some caveats:

* i haven't verified this algorithm.
* throughout, `move' refers to any turn of a single face.
  i don't know what bound is achieved in the quarter-turn metric.
* it may be the case that this algorithm has been improved.
  please let me (and cube-lovers) know if you have more information.


"rubik's cube in 42 moves"  by  hans kloosterman

the algorithm used here is a slight variant of thistlethwaite's
algorithm.  we work through a chain of subgroups:

G_0 = < F, B, L, R, U, D >   ( full group )

G_1 = < F2, B2, L, R, U, D >

G_2 = < F2, B2, L2, R2, U, D >

G_3 = subgroup of G_2 in which all U-cubies are in the U face
      (thus all D-cubies are in the D face and all U-D slice
      cubies are in the U-D slice)

G_4 = { 1 }.

there are four stages:  stage i reduces our pattern from G_{i-1} to G_i.

the indices of the subgroups are:

( G_0 : G_1 ) = 2048 = 2^11
( G_1 : G_2 ) = 1082565 = 3^9 * 5 * 11
( G_2 : G_3 ) = 4900 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7^2
( G_3 : G_4 ) = 3981310 = 2^14 * 3^5

the maximum number of moves in the stages are 7, 10, 8 and 18
respectively, for a maximum total of 43 moves.  however, in
the worst-case scenario of stages 3 and 4, it was checked that
no position actually required 26 moves; i.e. we can arrange a
cancellation between the two stages.  thus stages 3 and 4
together require 25 moves at most, which gives the final
figure of 42 moves.

it seems to me that a lot of work was done on an algorithm
for restoring the "magic domino" (the 2x3x3 puzzle), and
these results were applied to stages 3 and 4.

Subject: Are we approaching God's algorithm?

Because it might interest the readers and to be ahead of Peter Beck:
Saturday I received CFF (Cubism For Fun) # 28.
It has an interesting article by Herbert Kociemba from Darmstadt, who
describes his program to solve Rubik's Cube.  He states that he has not
yet encountered a configuration that required more than 21 moves.  A short
description follows:

Basicly the program consists of two stages, based on the groups:
G0:	[U,D,R,L,F,B]
G1:	[U,D,R^2,L^2,F^2,B^2]
G2:	I
The stages are from G0 to G1 and next from G1 to G2.  Note that the first
stage is the combination of the first two stages of Thistlethwaite, and
the last stages combine his last two stages.

His first stage can loosely be described as working in a three dimensional
coordinate system where the coordinates are resp. twist, flip and permutation.
He searches his way until the coordinate [0,0,0] is reached.  Most important
here is that he is able to find multiple ways.  The second stage is similar,
although he is not very clear here.

He uses lookup tables, but does not tell us how large his lookup tables
are.  But his program runs on 1 MByte Atari ST.  The heart is coded in
a few lines of 68k assembly, the remainder in GFA Basic.  As far as I
know GFA Basic it can be interpreted, but also compiled.  He does also
use tree pruning.

What he does is find successive solutions in stage 1 and fit solutions
from stage 2.  Letting the system run longer generally finds shorter
solutions.

His claims are on average less than 14 turns in stage 1, on average less
than 10 turns in stage 2.  But according to his article this is not completely
deterministic, so there is no proven upperbound.  Perhaps a proof can be
found; I do not know.  In practice he finds an upperbound of 21 moves, which
is indeed far better than other algorithms do obtain.

To take this in perspective here Thistlethwaites results from Singmaster's book:
Stage		1	2	3	4
Proven		7	13	15	17
Anticipated	7	12	14?	17
Best Possible	7	10?	13?	15?
(Are there configurations that require the maxima proven for Thistlethwaites
algorithm?)

Apparently the combination of stages largely reduces the number of turns
required.

In CFF 25 there was an article by Hans Kloosterman which did already improve
on the number of moves.  His stages 1 and 2 are identical to Thistlethwaites,
he has a third stage that combines the 3rd and 4th stages of Thistlethwaite.
He reports a proven maximum for his three stages of 7, 10 and 25 moves, so
slightly better than Thistlethwaites conjectured best figures.

Kociemba's algorithm appears however to be a big leap forward, although there
are no proofs yet.  One example:

In 1981 Christoph Bandelow wrote a book where he offered a prize for the
shortest sequence of moves that would flip every edge cuby and twists
every corner cuby.  The deadline was September 1, 1982; at that time the
prize was offered for a 23 move manoeuvre.  As Christoph writes:
	All solutions presented after the main deadline and shorter than
	all solutions submitted before were also proised a prize.  Using
	his very ingeneous new search program Herbert Kociemba, Darmstadt,
	Germany now found:
		DF^2U'(B^2R^2)^2LB'D'FD^2FB^2UF'LRU^2F'
	for 20 moves.
Kociemba himself writes about this:
	Our first solution had 12 moves in stage 1 and 14 moves in stage 2.
	In progress solutions 12+13, 12+12 and 12+11 were found.  However,
	as soon as we introduced manoeuvres of 13 moves in stage 1, we found
	successively 9, 8 and at last 7 moves for stage 2.  The program was
	stopped after treating about 3000 solutions.
He further states that the first solution in general takes 95 seconds, but
successive solutions take much shorter, and in general he finds one of less
than 22 moves in a few hours on his 8 MHz Atari.

What is clear is that one does not need the minimal solution in one stage
to get the minimal overall total.

does he describe his method of "tree pruning"?  this would seem to
be the "intelligent" part of the program, i.e. recognizing when to
abandon a given approach.  if anyone has any insight on the tree
pruning, please let me know.

it's not likely that this will lead to a proof of an effective upper
bound.  perhaps he can shave a few moves off the 42 obtained by
kloosterman, but i wouldn't expect him to prove an upper bound
anywhere near 21.  probably the best bet for this would be to
exhaustively calculate the diameter of the group  G_1  (with the
given generators) and the diameter of the coset space  G_0 / G_1.
their respective sizes are:  19508428800  and  2217093120,  both of
which are out of my league.

i'm not belittling kociemba's program; it's a very impressive feat!

now look what happens when people use TABs!  :-}  (the "Proven" line
should be shifted to the left.)

i believe that the diameters of the respective coset spaces are exactly
those numbers listed in the "Best Possible" line.  can anyone confirm
this?  i've finally written a few programs, and those are the diameters
i get.  i'm surprised that thistlethwaite didn't just do an exhaustive
search on these coset spaces.  perhaps it's just a matter of not having
the technology when he did his work (~12 years ago).

very nice.  now how about "superflip," and also "supertwist?"  these
are also reasonable candidates for antipodes of "START."  i know the
following manuever for "supertwist" (22 face / 30 quarter turns):
U F' U' (L R2 F2 B')^4  U F U'
(obtained by conjugating a manuever singmaster attributes to thistlethwaite)

it would also be nice to know how long this first solution usually is.

from the figures i have (111207592 "different" sequences of 7 or fewer
twists and 167024 "different" sequences of 6 or fewer twists WITHIN G_1)
it's clear that exhaustive search is too cumbersome.  thus i reiterate
both my statement that the "tree pruning" algorithm is the essential
part of this program, and my desire to know more about it (i.e. for
implementation purposes.)

He does not say how many, but his article gives nine patterns that have been
published earlier in CFF for which he finds shorter answers.  Also more are
promised for future issues.

I can give some information.  What he does do is calculate in advance through
the three axis of his space the minimal number of moves needed to get at
[0,0,0].  This is used for tree pruning.  It obviously will not prune
everything (e.g. if you are at point [x,y,z] it may very well be that [x,?,?]
for other points requires less moves, and similar across the y and z
direction), but he tells that his pruning is very effective.  I do not know
how he prunes in the second case, because he does not completely describes
the coordinates of his second space, but I presume pruning is done in a
similar way.

I think so too.  Moreover, it is difficult to take in account what he
found, namely that a minimal solution in the first stage does not guarantee
a minimal overall solution.

Well, apparently Thistlethwaite did not know that those were the diameters,
otherwise I have no explanation for the question marks as they appear in
Singmaster.

I will try to contact him to see what he has to say about those.

of course, these aren't exactly the patterns to test.  apply your
favorite quarter turn to either of these patterns, and you're
one move closer to START.

how do i know that we're one move closer to start?  the patterns
"superflip," "supertwist" and "superfliptwist" each have the
following three properties:

1. the group of symmetries of the pattern acts transitively on the
   set of "oriented" faces of the cube.
2. the pattern commutes with the square of each face turn.
3. the pattern is NOT in the subgroup generated by the squares of
   face turns.

now suppose that a pattern with the above properties requires
N  face turns to return to START.  let  A B C  be a minimal sequence
of face turns to solve this pattern, where  A, B,  and  C  are
subsequences such that:  A  consists only of squares of face turns,
B  is a quarter turn of some face and  C  is the rest of the sequence.
we can dissect the sequence into these three parts from hypothesis 3.
from hypothesis 2, the sequences  A B C  and  B C A  have the same
effect.  finally, from hypothesis 1, the quarter twist  B  may as well
be our favorite quarter twist.

see the hoey-saxe message on "symmetry and local maxima," for a good
discussion of this idea.  (in the archives, cube-mail-1, 14 dec 1980)

my apologies if this is obvious to everyone.

on the other hand, the kociemba algorithm isn't completely symmetric.
thus it may be wise for him to test 2 patterns: "super----" followed
by  U,  and "super----" followed by  R.  the tradeoff is testing 2
patterns for being 1 move closer.  i'd say this is probably a good trade.

now to correct something misleading i posted earlier:

) i believe that the diameters of the respective coset spaces are exactly

oops!  i don't mean to say "diameter" here!  these are coset spaces, so
there's no reason to suppose that (the group of automorphisms of the)
graph is vertex transitive.  what my programs calculated was the maximal
distance from the identity coset in each of these spaces.  (i am told
that the graph theory term is the "eccentricity" of the given vertex.)

Subject: More on the Cube (2x2x2 in this case).

Singmaster states that the diameter of the group for the 2x2x2 cube is not
known.  I do not know whether it has been calculated in the mean time, so
I just did calculate it.  The number of elements in the group is
3,674,160.  (Fix one corner, the others allow every permutation and one
third of all possible twists.)  The diameter is 11 if we do allow half-turns,
it is 14 if we do not allow half-turns.  The distribution is:
If we allow half-turns:
         1 with  0 moves
         9 with  1 moves
        54 with  2 moves
       321 with  3 moves
      1847 with  4 moves
      9992 with  5 moves
     50136 with  6 moves
    227536 with  7 moves
    870072 with  8 moves
   1887748 with  9 moves
    623800 with 10 moves
      2644 with 11 moves
If we do not allow half-turns:
         1 with  0 moves
         6 with  1 moves
        27 with  2 moves
       120 with  3 moves
       534 with  4 moves
      2256 with  5 moves
      8969 with  6 moves
     33058 with  7 moves
    114149 with  8 moves
    360508 with  9 moves
    930588 with 10 moves
   1350852 with 11 moves
    782536 with 12 moves
     90280 with 13 moves
       276 with 14 moves
In the first case heuristics give a diameter of at least 9.  We see that the
majority of the configuration is within distance 9 from start.  So it appears
that heuristics get close to the real value.
We see also that in both cases there is more than one diametrally opposite
configuration.  Next I will find out which those are (and if they have
something in common).

BTW, calculation did not take very long, only a few (<3) minutes on an FPS
(i.e.  an extremely fast SPARC).  But as the calculations are memory bound
rather than compute bound, the speed of the processor is not so very important.

singmaster says that the calculation took "over 51 hours of computer time"!
ouch!  this was 10 years ago, though.  (what's 51 hours / 3 minutes ?)

the "unix news item" from which singmaster apparently got his info was
included in a cube-lovers message.  it's in the archives, cube-mail-3,
sept 15, 1981 in a message from "ISAACS at SRI-KL".

dik's results show that the corners of the 3x3x3 can be "solved" (i.e.
positioned correctly with respect to one another) in 11 face (respectively
14 quarter) turns.  it would be nice to know if they can be solved with
respect to the centers within 11 face (respectively 14 quarter) turns.
this seems likely.

The first column agrees with Dik Winter's findings.  As Michael Reid

My hazy recollection is that the 2^3 program ran for a few minutes on
a Vax 750, while the corners program took a couple of hours.

I must have somewhere a printed stack of cube-lovers mailings, but I never
came around to read them all.  Also, my reference to Singmaster was his
notes.  The latest page of the latest printing states that the 2x2x2 case
was still unsolved, I never have seen his additional notes.

After Mike Reid's question I modified my program to do the counting on the
corners of the 3^3.  The biggest change was that it is now able to handle
that case in memory on this 32 MByte machine.  I did not count local maxima
(although that could be done).  The quarter turn case is identical to Dan
Hoey's results.  If we count half turns as a single move I get the following
results:
         1 with  0 moves
        18 with  1 moves
       243 with  2 moves
      2874 with  3 moves
     28000 with  4 moves
    205416 with  5 moves
   1168516 with  6 moves
   5402628 with  7 moves

Also here the diameter is the same.

My calculation took slightly less than half an hour.  The differences in
timings we see are (I think) mostly due to memory constraints on older
machines.  So we see a difference between Memory bound and I/O bound.
I could go to disk for storage of (intermediate) results, but even than the
edges can not be handled.  (980*10^9 configurations so my program would
require 245 GBytes of storage.  I think methods can be found to reduce this by
a factor of 30-40, but it is still much too large to handle, and in that case
you probably get the diameter only.)

Subject: Kociemba's algorithm

I am now trying to implement Kociemba's algorithm.  The initialization parts
are done.  To recap, it is a two stage algorithm.  The first stage tries to
get to the subgroup generated by [R^2,L^2,F^2,B^2,U,D], the second stages
comes back to start.

The first stage uses a three dimensional coordinate system: twistyness,
flippancy and choosyness (where are the 4 middle slice edge cubies?).
The second stage uses (I think) also a three dimensional coordinate system,
all permutations: corner cubies, edge cubies not on the middle slice, slice
cubies.  I found the maximal distance along each coordinate as follows:

stage 1:
twistyness:	6
flippancy:	7
choosyness:	4
This seems not in contradiction with his 10 moves or less on average.

stage 2:
corners:	13
edges:		8
slice edges:	4
I think this contradicts his 14 moves or less, there are configurations
that require at least 13 moves to get the corners correct.  I would be
surprised if only one more move is needed to get everything correct.

*But* some of his best moves use a sub-optimal solution for stage 1!
Now if that could be quantified...

Next step is implementing the searching algorithms.

I have implemented it based on his description.  I am not yet completely
satisfied, but can give some results.  Both are the best I found after a
run of about 30 minutes.  (The numbers are first the number of moves to
get at [F^2,R^2,B^2,L^2,U,D], second the numbr of moves to complete.)

Superflip:
(11+10=21): F B R U^2 B^2 U' D' R^2 B' R L U F^2 L^2 D^2 B^2 D' F^2 D L^2 D

Supertwist:
(7+9=16): F R^2 L^2 U^2 D^2 F^2 B' R^2 U F^2 B^2 R^2 L^2 U^2 D' L^2

So clearly the supertwist is not even close to the opposite of start!

Currently the program needs still a bit of hand-tuning.  I am looking how
I can improve that.

Subject: Kociemba's algorithm

I have made my program a bit faster.  While previously the best I found for
superflip was a 21 move solution (even after 10 hours computation time,
actually the solution was found after about 30 minutes), I have now a 20
move solution, found after only 15 minutes:

Superflip:
(13+7=20): F B U^2 R F^2 R^2 B^2 U' D F U^2 R' L' U B^2 D R^2 U B^2 U

Some more information.  First a short recap.  Phase1 brings the cube in
the group generated by [F^2,R^2,B^2,L^2,U,D], phase2 brings him back
to start.  Phase 1 searches in the space generated by the three (orthogonal)
coordinates:
Twist (2187 entries), flip (2048 entries) and slice-edge-cube placing (495
entries).
Phase 2 searches in the space generated by the three (non-orthogonal)
coordinates:
Permutations of corner cubes (40320 entries), permutations of edge cubes
not in the middle slice (40320 entries) and permutations of the middle
slice edge cubes (24 entries).

While Kociemba originally did tree pruning based on the minimal number of
moves needed along single coordinates, I now use pairs of coordinates
(except that in phase 2 the 40320*40320 pair is not used of course).
This is part of the speed-up.  (Another part is that I do now disallow
successive moves of a single face, three or more consecutive moves of
opposite faces, and a move of an opposite face if the current face moved
is B, L or D.)

Program details: the program starts with phase1 allowing for succesively
1, 2 etc. until a maximal number of moves.  As soon as phase1 hits a
solution phase2 is called, again with a maximum number of moves starting
at 1.  This means that if the program runs long enough it will ultimately
find the shortest solutions (phase 1 might just solve it!).  But that wil
take a long time (of course).  For the superflip, the program has now
checked all phase1 solutions of upto 12 moves and is busy with 13.  It
found 792256 solutions of 12 moves (and that in less than 10 minutes)!

Some additional data about minimal paths along coordinates:
Phase 1:
twist:		6
flip:		7
choice:		5
twist+flip:	9
twist+choice:	9
flip+choice:	9

Phase 2:
corners:	13
edges:		8
slice edges:	4
corners+slice:	14
edges+slice:	12

Based on this I expect a maximal distance in phase 1 of about 10/11, and
in phase 2 of about 16/17.

Subject: My program is too fast ;-).

I have posted a bit on my version of Kociemba's program, and I can only
conclude that my program is too fast.  After doing the superfliptwist,
the superflip and the supertwist I thought about trying those configurations
where Singmaster's notes did not give a solution better than 21 moves.
I find now that it takes more time to enter the configurations than what
the program needs to solve it!  Upto now I found the following (I will not
give the exact moves, as I think Kociemba wants to publish a bit more about
this):
superflip:	20 moves
supertwist:	16 moves
superfliptwist:	20 moves
Walker's 6+:	17 moves (was 22)
Walker's 6X:	19 moves (was 25)
Walker's worm:	14 moves (was 23)

Initialization time for the program is 2.5 minutes.  But it finds solutions
after only a few seconds!  If you have a configuration that you think is at
a large distance from start, mail it and I will disprove it ;-).

stop it, you're killing me!  i also have the same idea for combining
the "coordinates" in pairs, but i'm not getting too far implementing
it.  :-(  i wouldn't suggest using singmaster's notes for pattern
maneuvers.  have you seen bandelow's book?  it has very short
maneuvers for most patterns, including two different ones for
"walker's worm" in 14 turns (assuming i've got the right pattern in
mind).  bandelow counts "slice turns" as one move, though, so
his maneuver for 6X (order 3) is 24 face turns.

what amazes me about this whole business is that the algorithm
finds very short moves when they exist.  i would have expected
the program to produce maneuvers of approximately the same
length for all patterns.  i would say that this is a major step
forward.

you'll probably be swamped with patterns to test, but here's a
couple:

stripes: (18) F3 U1 F2 U3 R1 B2 R3 U1 F2 L2 U3 L1 B2 L3 U1 L2 U3 F1.

python: (15) R1 U3 F3 B1 L1 F2 L3 F1 B3 U3 R3 L1 F2 U2 L3.

since i found these by hand, i'm curious to see how close they
are to optimal.  hopefully i'll have my program running soon.

after a long struggle, it appears that i finally have kociemba's
algorithm working properly, with the improvement that dik mentioned.
the first pattern i tested was "anaconda" (bandelow's terminology),
which dik called "walker's worm" (singmaster's terminology?).
(i think that's the same pattern.)  within 10 minutes, most of which
was initializing tables, the program produced the following 14 quarter
turn maneuver, which is better (in the quarter turn metric) than the two
maneuvers bandelow gives in his book.  here it is:

anaconda: (14 qt) B1 R1 D3 R3 F1 B3 D1 F3 U1 D3 L1 F1 L3 U3.

more results as they come in.  my program isn't quite finished yet;
hopefully i won't screw it up attempting to improve it.

Leider haben wir nur die Deutschen Ausgabe.  There are apparently
differences between the German and the English edition.  The English
edition is later and has probably improved sequences (he has promised
also improved sequences for the second German edition, but I do not
think it ever came out).

The point is that my program deliberately tries short sequences first in
both phases.  This is at the expense of more work when longer sequences
are tried (because you will find the shorter sequences again that you
abort).  The main advantage is that if you find an overall short sequence
you have much less work to do in the second phase, and can much faster
abort your searches.  Here some information about the searching for
superflip (the numbers are for phase 1):
	Length	Number found	Solutions found
	   8	      0		-
	   9	      0		-
	  10	   3072		10+13, 10+12
	  11	  61568		11+10
	  12	 792256		-
	  13	8695488		13+ 7
As you see when having the large number of solutions for length 13 in phase 1
we have only to look at most 7 moves deep in phase 2, and 6 deep as soon as
we found the solution (which occurs reasonably fast).  That is why it is
possible to do all that work in about 45 minutes.  (For der Mouse, the machine
is an FPS.  A SPARC processor twice as fast as a SPARCStation ELC.  But I
think the program is bounded by memory access time.  The program requires
about 12 MB memory.)  Now I think the longest distance in phase 1 is about 11
or 12 (it is at least 11, that is sure).  So in general you will find a
solution already when there is no need yet to do very much.

I could not improve the first but what do you think of:

14 for python is probably optimal.  But you can try as you have your program

I don't remember from the earlier description; are the searches being done
depth-first or breadth-first?  If breadth-first, then there is no reason to
put an upper limit on the number of moves for finding a phase1 solution,
since the algorithm HAS to solve phase1 in order to find an overall solution.

Once you have an overall solution, of course, the length of phase1+phase2
solution can be used as an upper bound on subsequent phase1 solutions.

Also, do you reduce the "maximum number of moves" for phase2 based on
solutions already found?  For instance, once you have found a combined
phase1+phase2 solution in 20 moves, then if you find an alternative phase1
solution in 14 moves there is no reason to look deeper than 5 moves in
phase2 (or 6 if you want to find all solutions that tie for minimum length).

I do depth-first.  I think the breadth of the tree is much too large to be
handled in breadth first fashion (currently I abort the program when it
reaches a length in phase 1 such that the number of solutions is a few
million).

Right.

Also done, I do not look for ties.

I did some more and found fast algorithms.  The most amazing one was for
the configuration with two 2x2x2 cubes embedded in the cube:
	( 9+ 6=15): U1 L2 D1 R1 B3 R1 B3 R1 B3 D3 L2 U1 R2 F2 U2
This looks remarkably like a random sequence of moves.  I find especially
the part R1 B3 R1 B3 R1 B3 intriguing!

i mentioned these because i was particularly proud of them, especially
since they were constructed by hand.  my program was able to improve
"stripes", but i reoriented the pattern first.  perhaps this is why
i had better success.  stripes (17 face / 20 quarter):
R1 U1 D1 R2 F1 U3 D1 F3 B1 U3 R3 L3 B1 L2 U1 D3 B2  (14 + 3)
so if you have any efficient pattern maneuvers that you're especially
proud of, let's see if they can't be improved.

'tis a shame.  the english edition is very good.  i've never seen the

here's what my program has to say about them.
"rattlesnake"  14 face / 18 quarter turns:

this last one was very nice, since it was completely solved in stage 1!

> Also done, I do not look for ties.

i am currently looking for ties, but will soon stop.  this is mainly to
catch (by eye) maneuvers that are short quarter turn-wise.  i realize
this is stupid for at least two reasons:  1: the program may well be
passing up sequences which are shorter in quarter turns;  2: a slightly
different version of the program will specifically look for the shortest
sequence in quarter turns.  i'm trying to think of the best way to do this.
unfortunately, the temptation is NOT to think, but to feed every
imaginable pattern into the program.  :-)

still need to do some polishing ...

True.  Orientation of non-symmetric patterns is important because the first

Yup.  But the last but one will not improve and is optimal, and in fact solved
with stage 1 (but you did not find it because you limited your search 12 deep).

How true.  I stopped feeding new patterns.  Currently I am calculating the
maximal distance in stage 1.  It will take a bit of time because I have to
consider 2,217,093,120 possibilities.  But I think that the method I have
is feasible.  My conjecture was that the maximal distance was 11 or 12.
That was wrong.  It is at least 12 (the superfliptwist needs 12 moves in
phase 1).  My current conjecture is 12.  Work is in progress, the first
1,082,565 configurations give the following picture (i.e. all configurations
without flip):
Moves	Number
  0	     1
  1	     2
  2	    17
  3	   134
  4	  1065
  5	  8214
  6	 54919
  7	269388
  8	562427
  9	183730
 10	  2668
The pattern is similar to what was found with the 2x2x2 cube.  The majority
of configurations requires 2 less than the maximum.  But apparently flips are
harder to deal with than the rest of phase 1, so I am waiting for more results.
Note that 12 would improve Kloostermans 42 moves to 37.

how much time do you anticipate the job will take?  it seems that we'd
get a much better improvement (of kloosterman's bound) by calculating
the maximal distance in stage 2.  of course, this requires going through
19,508,428,800 possibilities (nearly 9 times as many).  is this feasible?
also it seems that "god's algorithm" for stage 2 (i.e. face turns are
restricted to  D, U, B2, F2, L2, R2) would be very similar to
god's algorithm for the "magic domino," and this similarity should
become stronger as the patterns get further away from START.

from the pruning tables used in stage 2, dik gives the following maximal
distances:

> Phase 2:
> corners:	13
> edges:		8
> slice edges:	4
> corners+slice:	14
> edges+slice:	12

i was slightly surprised to see a difference between the figures for
"corners" and those for "corners + slice edges".  but the difference
between "edges" and "edges + slice edges" is shocking.  so perhaps the
two "god's algorithms" above are not TOO similar.

> Based on this I expect a maximal distance  [ ... ]

i'm pretty sure i know a pattern that requires 15 face turns.  i wouldn't
be all that surprised if 15 was the maximum, although i haven't tested many
patterns.

A few days.  I started yesterday night at 2:30 AM, it is now 11:05 PM.  I have
calculated the distances for approximately 145 million configurations.  The
majority of the work has been done sinc 6:00 PM.  (I am using 39 SGI Indigo's,
1 Large SGI, 2 processors of an SGI file server and the scalar (SPARC)
processor of an FPS, so it is lots of computer time!)

Right.  But is not feasible, at least I do not see possibilities at this
moment.  My estimate is that it would take much more than 9 times as much.
The reason is that the algorithm as I have organized it allows a lot of
shortcuts.  What I do is in the space of order 2048 * 2187 * 495 assign to
each processor in turn a slice of the 2048 dimension.  Within that slice,
going from 0 moves until every configuration has been assigned a distance,
a path is searched for the given distance.  The major shortcut comes when
a path is found.  Using configurations with known distance, U, D, L and R
turns are applied and also F2 and L2 turns to calculate new distances.
For those moves the flip does not change.  This makes that I have to search
paths for only about 10% of the cases.  I see no way (yet) to do similar
things for phase 2.

Subject: new upper bound

i've managed to reduce the upper bound for the length of god's
algorithm to 39 face turns / 56 quarter turns.  we work in three
stages:

1. from  <U, F, R, L, B, D>  to  <U, R, F>
2. from  <U, R, F>           to  <U, R2, F2>
3. from  <U, R2, F2>         to  START

where we're only allowed to use moves that keep us within the
given subgroup.

these three stages were chosen because of the moderate(!) sizes
of the coset spaces that must be considered.  the numbers are
253440,  15676416,  and  10886400.  the maximum number of moves
in each stage was calculated by exhaustively searching the space.

if we count by "face turns," these maximum numbers are 8, 13 and 19.
however, if we make any turns in stage 2, the last such is a quarter
turn of either  F  or  R, and the direction is irrelevant.  those
positions at distance 19 in stage 3 (only 24 in all) were checked
to see that they may be solved in 19 face turns starting with
either  F2  or  R2.  therefore we can arrange to combine the last
move of stage 2 with the first move of stage 3 in the event that
we must make the maximal number of moves in each stage.  this
gives the final figure of 39 face turns.

if we count by "quarter turns," the maximum numbers are 9, 16 and 33.
this time, those configurations at distance either 32 or 33 in stage 3
(only 10 and 4 positions, respectively) were tested as above.
each has minimal sequences starting with  F2  and with  R2.  as above,
we may cancel a quarter turn from the end of stage 3 with a quarter
turn at the beginning of stage 3, to get the final figure of 56
quarter turns.

the next step is to reduce the figure for stage 3 by allowing other
turns.  i only plan on allowing  D, U, B2, F2, L2, R2,  as in the
second stage of kociemba's algorithm.  after that, i may try to reduce
the numbers for stage 2.  however, in this case, i don't expect much
of a reduction (maybe 1 turn).

Subject: New upper bound on God's algorithm for Rubik's cube

Earlier than expected I have gotten my results.  Using a farm of workstations
I have calculated the distances for all cosets in phase 1 of Kociemba's
algorithm.  As I have conjectured already, the maximal distance is 12.
Together with Kloosterman's result for their third and fourth phase (which
together form Kociemba's second phase) the upperbound on God's algorithm
is now 37.  Below follows the set of distances for the first phase:
  0:          1
  1:          4
  2:         74
  3:       1230
  4:      18056
  5:     245902
  6:    3082221
  7:   34529024
  8:  301243996
  9: 1209021801
 10:  663711855
 11:    5238847
 12:        109
tot: 2217093120

It took quite a bit of computer time.  In all 116 processors in 112 different
machines have cooperated, although not all at the same time %.  The maximal
amount of concurrent processing was on 100 processors last night.  The
distribution was: 69 Sun's (SS 1, SS 1+, SLC, ELC), 40 SGI's, 1 SGI 4D/310VGX,
5 processors of an SGI 260S compute server and the scalar (SPARC) processor
of an FPS 500.  I expect it would have taken one or two hours only on a machine
with 1 GByte of memory.  Calculations on the second phase are still out of
the question.  Distributing the processing would take much more than 9 times
as much.  I expect it would take about a day on a machine with 4 GByte of
memory.

I conjecture that the maximal distance in phase 2 is at most 16.  There is a
lower bound on it of 14.  This would make the upperbound for God's algorithm 28.

but i don't understand how we can get 74 positions at distance 2 from
only 4 positions at distance 1.  the 4 positions at distance 1 are
easy to see: they're the positions obtained from START by the turns
B, F, L  and  R.  with only 18 different face turns, each should
extend to at most 18 positions at distance 2.  am i missing something
obvious here?  (the numbers do seem to add up, though.)

the pattern (written in permutation notation)  (FR, FL) (UFL, DFR) is
at distance 15, so that's (also) a lower bound.  however, if the whole
cube is turned so that the  F  face becomes the  U face, then the new
pattern is still in the subgroup of stage 2, but is now at distance 14.

I retract my earlier message.  There is something definitely wrong!
(All that idle time wasted...)  I have to reconsider!

Subject: details ...

perhaps i should give the figures i obtained when getting my upper
bound of 39 face / 56 quarter turns in case i also have an error.
recall the method: we work in three stages:

1. from  <U, F, R, L, B, D>  to  <U, R, F>
2. from  <U, R, F>           to  <U, R2, F2>
3. from  <U, R2, F2>         to  START

where we're only allowed to use moves that keep us within the
given subgroup.  the number of positions that must be considered
in each stage are  253440,  15676416,  and  10886400 respectively.

it would be nice if someone could confirm these figures.  i have done
some testing, but not extensively.

Subject: Program bug, and new ideas.  Will they work?

Well, I found the bug.  There was an initialization error which made the
program think there was a shorter path than there was in a number of cases.
Alas, as always, the bug did not reveal itself in the test runs I did, it
was only in the final totals that it was apparent.

The bad thing is that removing the bug increases the compute time considerably,
because you have in essence to calculate an explicit path for every
configuration.  I estimate the increase is by a factor of about 3, based on
some experiments.

The good thing is that it got me thinking about an old idea I had.
To calculate path lengths to the group generated by [U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2]
it is irrelevant whether you rotate the complete cube around the U-D
axis.  Also half turn rotations around the R-L axis are irrelevant.
And finally, mirroring the cube along the F-R-B-L plane is irrelevant!
But in most cases this changes twist/flip and position values.  So if
we look at the twist/flip/position space of 2187*2048*495 cosets we can
reduce the calculations along one dimension as long as we remember the
number of representations.  I did some calculations and found that
2187 can be reduced to 168 or 2048 can be reduced to 219 or 495 can be
reduced to 45.  Of these obviously the first one is the most fruitful.
Of course I have to check myself (and anybody who is willing, go ahead).
Reduction of 2187 to 168 would reduce the total space from 2,217,093,120
to 170,311,680 calculations.  But then again, dividing the latter figure
by 4, that could be done in core on a machine with about 50 MByte of memory
(to calculate path lengths in core only 2 bits per configuration are needed).

I will try around, dik
