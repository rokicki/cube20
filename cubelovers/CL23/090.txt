Sorry I do not know of anything similar to NKC in Germany.

I put most of the information about CFF/NKC including some tables of

	http://wwwtg.mp.tudelft.nl/~rob/cff.html
Please don't hesitate to email me if you still have questions.

After finally finding an original Rubik's Cube I have some 3x3x3's left.
What are the most interesting bandaged cubes or other puzzles one can
