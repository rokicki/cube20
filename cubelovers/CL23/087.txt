 If you were lucky, you could use a good CAD program to define the shapes,
and NC machine tools to produce them; also possible is Rapid Prototyping.

 A graphic computer simulation would also be a substitute for a physical
puzzle, although holding one in your hand beats just about any graphics.

 Good luck!
