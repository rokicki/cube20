	Mark:

	There is a virtual Megaminx at my Rubik Gallery

	http://www.iol.ie/~goyra/Rubik.html

It's not written for the PC: it's in Java, so it works on alll the major
kinds of computer. In fact, you don't need to download or install
anything, just use a Java browser and you can play with the
puzzles immediately.

	Control is via the mouse. The puzzles are not self-solving
but if anyone wants to write a solver and make use of my graphical
representation of the puzzles, get in touch.

> I am particularly interested in processes for the 10-spot and
> 12-spot.

	What exactly are these, I may want to put them in the
Gallery.
