I'll take a crack at a number of your questions. 

There are probably a lot of people on the list who are not conversant
with group theory, but I'll bet essentially everybody knows at least a
little bit about basic set theory.  I'm old enough that when I was
taking algebra in high school in the early 60's, "new math" was all the
rage. It turns out that "new math" was really just set theory. 

Many traditionalists were aghast that this wierd "new math" stuff was
being taught.  Never mind that it was hundreds of years old.  And never
mind that set theory is the foundation of nearly all modern mathematics. 
For example, most formal treatments of the concept of a function view a
function as a set of ordered pairs (which has to satisfy certain rules). 

Anyway, sets are just collections of objects where the basic rule is
that for any object you can unequivically determine that the object
either is or is not in the set.  We might write a set as something like
{a,b,c} where the braces denote the set and the elements a, b, and c are
listed within the braces.  We often give names to sets, as in A={a,b,c}. 
And finally, we have subsets, where for example {a,b}, {a,c}, {a}, etc.
are subsets of {a,b,c}.  Subsets can have names as well.  For example,
we might say B={a,b} and then we would say that B is a subset of A.

If you know what sets are, then it's easy to talk about groups. 
Oversimplifying slightly, a group is just a set, an operation on that
set, and a short list of rules.  As a simple example, the real numbers
and addition form a group.  The real numbers are the set and addition is
the operation.  Exactly what the short list of rules is does not matter
for now, but be assured that real numbers and addition do comply with
the required rules for a group.

Just as there are subsets of sets, there are subgroups of groups.  For
example, the rational numbers form a subset of the real numbers.
Similarly, the rational numbers and addition form a subgroup of real
numbers and addition.  The integers form a subset of the rational
numbers.  The integers and addition form a subgroup of the rational
numbers and addition.

It is very common to be a little sloppy and simply identify a group as
being the set if the operation is well understood.  So we might say that
the integers form a group if it is well understood that we are talking
about addition as being the group operation.  So I will be a little
sloppy myself to make my sentences a little shorter. 

Not every subset is a subgroup.  For example, the set of even integers
is a subgroup of the integers, but the set of odd integers is not a
subgroup of the integers.  If you add two even integers together, the
result is an even integer.  But if you add two odd integers together,
the result is not an odd integer.  One of the group rules is that if you
combine two elements from the set together, then the result must also be
in the set or else you don't have a group.

In the case of the cube, the set is the collection of all positions
which can be reached by scrambling the cube in all possible ways, and
the operation is "followed by".  For real numbers and addition, we might
write x+y to indicate adding x and y together.  For cube positions, we
might write XY to mean "X followed by Y".  Even though it is not
multiplication in the every day sense of real numbers, XY is often
called a product and the "followed by" operation is often called
multiplication.

Basic operations on the cube consist of twisting one face.  These
operations are called F, B, U, D, L, and R if you twist the Front, Back,
Up, Down, Left, and Right faces clockwise by 90 degrees.  The respective
counterclockwise twists are called F', B', U', D', L', and R'.  The
respective 180 twists are called F2, B2, U2, D2, L2, and R2.  For 180
degree twists, it doesn't matter whether your twist is clockwise or
counterclockwise. 

Notice, for example, that FF=F2.  That is "F followed by F" is the same
thing as turning the Front face by 180 degrees.  Also, F'F'=FF=F2, etc.,
and FFF=F' (90+90+90 degrees clockwise is the same thing as 90 degrees
counterclockwise), etc.

There are many ways to define a group or a subgroup.  One of the more
common ways is in terms of generators.  The generator notation is <S>,
where S is some set or list of elements.  For example, with the integers
and addition, we might define a subgroup as <3>.  This means {3, 3+3,
3+3+3, ...} so <3> is the group of all integers which are divisible by
3.

One of the rules for groups is that every element in the set must have
an opposite, usually called an inverse.  For example, with integers and
addition the opposite of 3 is -3, and the opposite of -3 is 3.  The
generator notation automatically includes inverses.  So if we write <3>
for integers and addition, it is the same as writing <3,-3>.  So we
could write <3> or <-3> or <3,-3> and it would all mean the same thing,
namely {..., -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, ...}.  (To simplify things, I lied
slightly in the previous paragraph when I left out the negative numbers. 
Groups require inverses, and with addition the way you get inverses is
to include the negative numbers.) 

With the cube, the way you get inverses is that F' is the inverse of F
and F is the inverse of F', etc.  F2 is its own inverse, so we would
write (F2)'=F2. 

Given all that, the way we would write generators for the cube group
would be as <F,B,U,D,L,R>.  Remember that we do not have to include F',
B', etc. because they are included automatically.  On the other hand, if
you are left handed you might want to write the generators as
<F',B',U',D',L',R'> and you would not have to include F, B, etc. because
they would be included automatically.  Also, you do not have to include
F2, B2, etc. because we can get F2 as FF, we can get B2 as BB, etc. 

The <F,B,U,D,L,R> notation essentially says the following.  Beginning
with a cube which is solved (which is at Start), we get the cube group
by combining together the F, B, U, D, L, and R operations in all
possible ways.  This is just another way of saying that we would
scramble the cube in all possible ways by turning all six of the faces
in all possible ways. 

We now have enough definitions and notations in place to start talking
about Thistlethwaite's algorithm.  Consider what it means to say <U>. 
This means that you can twist the Up face any way you want, but you
can't twist any of the other faces.  This also means that the group is
{U,UU,UUU,UUUU}. 

If you are new at this, you ought to have a few questions.  For example,
where is U'?  Well, U' is the same thing as UUU, so U' is included (270
clockwise is the same thing as 90 degrees counterclockwise).  Where is
U2?  Well, U2 is the same thing as UU, so U2 is included.  What about
UUUUU and UUUUUU etc.?  Well, UUUU is the same thing as not twisting at
all (360 degrees clockwise is the same thing as not twisting), so
UUUUU=U, UUUUUU=UU, etc.  No matter how you twist, as long as you
confine yourself to the Up face, there are only four possible positions.

UUUU is normally written as I (for the identity).  Every group must have
an identity.  For addition, the identity is zero.  For the cube, we
normally just write I.  It should be obvious, for example, that UU'=I
and that U'U=I.  That is, if you twist the Up face 90 degrees clockwise
and immediately twist the Up face 90 degrees counterclockwise, you are
back where you started. 

Now, let's go back to the idea of solving the bottom two layers of the
cube first, then solving the Up layer.  It is very likely that after
solving the bottom two layers, the Up layer would look very scrambled. 
But we might get very lucky and discover that Up layer was already in
<U>.  That is, it might already be in one of the four positions, U, UU,
U'=UUU, or I.  If the Up layer were already at I by accident, then the
whole cube would already be solved.  If it were in one of the other
three positions, then we could finish solving the cube by simply
twisting the Up face and there would be no need to disturb either of the
bottom two layers.

The Thistlethwaite algorithm accomplishes the same sort of thing, except
that it is by design rather than by luck. 

We have already considered the group <F,B,U,D,L,R> where you scramble
the cube in any way you want using any twist of any face.  Now, consider
the group <F2,B2,U,D,L,R>.  What this means is that starting with a
solved cube, we scramble it any way we want by making any twists we want
of the U, D, L, and R faces, but for the F and B faces we can only make
180 degree twists.  It turns out that by so doing, we cannot reach as
many positions as we can if we allow 90 degree twists of all six faces. 
Hence, we would say that <F2,B2,U,D,L,R> is a subgroup of <F,B,U,D,L,R>. 

A key point of the <F2,B2,U,D,L,R> subgroup is that if we can create a
position in it by using only the indicated moves, than we can also
reverse the process and solve any position in it by using only the
indicated moves.

A position in the <F2,B2,U,D,L,R> subgroup is "somewhat solved" in much
the same sense that a cube with the bottom layer solved is "somewhat
solved", but a position in <F2,B2,U,D,L,R> still looks pretty scrambled. 
There is some disagreement among Cube-Lovers as to whether you can look
at a scrambled cube and determine easily whether it is in
<F2,B2,U,D,L,R> or not.  I will leave that question unaddressed for the
purposes of this note.

The real point is that suppose that you were in <F,B,U,D,L,R> and by
some clever strategy or other managed to get your cube into
<F2,B2,U,D,L,R>.  You would have made some hard won progress. 
Furthermore, you could solve the cube without giving up any of your hard
won progress because you could solve the cube without making any more 90
degree F and B moves.  This is very much unlike the situation of solving
by layer, where inevitably you must give up some hard won progress.  It
was thinking along these lines that led me to think in terms of closed
and open groups, namely those where you can or cannot proceed without
giving up any of your hard won progress.

The Thistlethwaite algorithm tells you how to get from <F,B,U,D,L,R> to
<F2,B2,U,D,L,R>.  It continues by a progression of subgroups that goes
something like <F2,B2,U2,D2,L,R> and then <F2,B2,U2,D2,L2,R2> on its way
to Start.  So Thistelthwaite is trying to get into a position where 90
degree turns are no longer necessary and the solution can be completed
using only 180 degree moves.

Let's go back to the <U> subgroup just for a minute, where
<U>={I,U,U2,U'}.  <U2> is a subgroup of <U> where <U2>={I,U2}.  As a
silly example of the Thistlethwaite technique, we could go from <U> to
<U2> and then on to I.  For example, suppose we were at U, which is in
<U>.  Since we are bound and determined to get into <U2>, we could make
the move U which takes us into <U2> and we could complete the solution
by making the move U2.  Hence, we have solved the position U with two
moves (namely U U2) when one would have sufficed (namely U').  As silly
as this example is, it is illustrative of the way in which
Thistlethwaite's method is suboptimal, and how Thistlethwaite's method
can be improved. 

Finally, I think the most elegant sequence of closed subgroups is more
in the vein of starting with a corner and working your way out from the
corner by layer. For example, you might first solve a 2x2x2 subcorner of
a 3x3x3, then solve the other three faces.  This approach does not
inherently involve any preference for 180 degree turns.  I like it
because I do not like counting 180 degree turns.  The trouble with this
approach is that, for example, <U,R,F> is an awfully big group to solve
all at one go. Mike Reid has suggested breaking down <U,R,F> into
<U2,R,F> etc. to make the problem manageable, but then we are back into
using 180 degree turns.
