"David Byrden" <Goyra@iol.ie> asked for clarification.

Spot patterns are those in which all the corner and edge cubies agree
with each other, but not necessarily with all the face centers.  They
are so named because the non-matching face centers show up as
contrasting spots.

Mark reported some analysis on them on 31 Oct 95, apparently from GAP.
As he reported, there are five conjugacy classes:

    0. The identity,
    1. The  72-degree twelve-spot,
    2. The 144-degree twelve-spot,
    3. The 120-degree ten-spot,
    4. The 180-degree ten-spot.

The angle given is the displacement of the corners-and-edges ensemble
from the face-centers ensemble.  In cases 1 and 2, the rotation is
about an axis through two opposite face centers; in case 3, through
opposite corners; in case 4, through opposite edges.

Of course, there's no reason to expect optimal processes for these
patterns to the same length.  Interestingly, while the square of the
72-degree is the 144-degree, it is also the case that the square of
the 144-degree is the 72-degree (up to conjugacy).

It's also interesting to consider star patterns, in which the edges
agree with the face centers, and the corners agree with each other.
These come in the same classes as the spots.

A third type of pattern is a distorted checkerboard, in which the
corners and face centers agree with each other, and the edges agree
with each other.  These come in the same classes as well.  I had hoped
to find some in which the edges were apparently reflected with respect
to the face centers (as in the Pons Asinorum and the order 6 6-X
patterns on the cube) but they seem to be in the wrong orbit for the
Megaminx.
