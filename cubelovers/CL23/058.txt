Hmmm.  I would imagine a large number of the 4x4x4 cubes sold in the U.S. as
"Rubik's Revenge" were sold to non-cube-lovers and are now tucked away in attics
and basements with all the other toys the kids have outgrown.  For this reason
I've considered checking out local garage and yard sales.  (Before it became
widely known what the value of old baseball cards could be, these sales were an
excellent way for collectors to pick up large boxes of old cards for only a few
dollars).

Anyway, I hope Christoph still has the Megaminx because I just sent him a check
for some items including this. :)  There was no indication he was out of them in
the catalog I just got.
