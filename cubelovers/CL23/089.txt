Subject: Re: puzzle to be simulated

Continuing on my quest for Ponderesque cube-planes made of a square
torus, possibly cut on the bias, I notice that any square torus will
have k=a^2+b^2 faces for some a>b; if b=0 there is no bias.  Carl
Ponder suggests (if I understand it correctly) cutting each face into
nine facets, and permuting the puzzle by turning a face together with
the 16 neighboring facets.  As with Rubik's cube, the edge facets move
in pairs (called edge cubies).  The corner facets move in quadruplets
(called corner cubies).

There are k corner cubies that can apparently achieve any of four
orientations (twist) each, and 2k edge cubies that can apparently
achieve any of two orientations (flip) each.  The face center cubies
can achieve any of four orientations (twist) each but never move.

So the "constructible" group size--the size of the group before we
consider parity and orientation constraints--is k! (2k)! 16^k, or
k! (2k)! 64^k for the supergroup.

But if a+b is even, we can shade the faces in a checkerboard, and the
shades never change when we turn the faces.  So in this case, the
edges never flip, and the corners have only two orientations.  The
checkerboard-constructible group size is then k! (2k)! 2^k, or 
k! (2k)! 8^k for the supergroup.

Everyone who knows Rubik's cube will suspect (and everyone who
understands orientation theory will know!) that the corner
orientations must sum to zero (mod 4) and the edge orientations must
sum to zero (mod 2).  If a+b is even, there is only a corner
orientation constraint (mod 2).  [See my article of 23 September 1982
for a sketch of orientation theory.  Essentially, if the orientation
group of a kind of piece is Abelian then there is an orientation
constraint of the order of that orientation group.]

The permutation parity constraint is also familiar to anyone who knows
the cube.  The edge permutation parity must equal the corner
permutation parity, and in the supergroup the parity of the face
center twist must also be equal (mod 180 degrees).

So we should find groups of size k! (2k)! 2^f(k), where

    f(k)=4k - 4     a+b odd, or
    f(k)= k - 2     a+b even

for the permutation group, and

    f(k)=6k - 5     a+b odd, or
    f(k)=3k - 3     a+b even

for the supergroup.

I've used GAP to find the group sizes for
     (a,b) = (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1),
and the group sizes agree except for (2,0) and (2,1).  The group
is smaller than expected by a factor of

      5040 for the (2,0) permutation group,
     20160 for the (2,0) supergroup,
         6 for the (2,1) permutation group, and
        12 for the (2,1) supergroup.

I'm not too surprised about the (2,0) groups (for instance, all four
corner cubies move cyclically on every turn!) but I don't see why
(2,1) is pathological.  Maybe it's one of those special group things
that happen for just one permutation group.

By the way, I suggest that a simulation of these should not try to
map them to a curved torus, but to a toroidal tesselation of the
plane.  Then when you turn one piece, you see a lattice of other
pieces turning in synchrony.
