	I just extended the technique that had worked for me on the 
smaller cubes.

	Solve the corners, then solve the inner edges, then eventually
the faces in the interior of the sides. By choosing these 5 subsets
of the faces, which of course do not exchange faces with each other, 
you break the cube into a sequence of 5 smaller problems. Working 
inwards from the outermost faces is best because you can easily find 
operators (combinations of moves) that affect the inner faces in some 
way but preserve the outer ones that you have already solved.
