There's a paper on my web page which indirectly
explains how. (It's actually a math paper written with
a student of mine explaining the group theory of the puzzle.)
What's useful are some of the moves which we give.
If you can't print it out (It's a dvi file) I'll mail it to you
if you give me your postal address. 
http://www.nadn.navy.mil/MathDept/wdj/rubik.html

The idea, if I remember, is
1. get into a square form,
2. use the special moves we give (moves which permute 3
pieces only and leave the others alone, for example)
to solve the puzzle as one solves the Rubik's cube.
