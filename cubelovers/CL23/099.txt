RUBIK'S CUBE WORLD RECORD LIST
------------------------------

I have created a list of Rubik's Cube world records in the WWW with the URL:
http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/~saxonia/list/rubik.html

It is about speed cubing world records and other funny stuff (cube marathon
record etc.)

I would be glad about comments and corrections to this list. (New record
categories are very welcome: Particularly I am interested in the 4x4x4 
cube speed solving world record!)
If you do not have access to the WWW, just send me an e-mail, and I will send
you the list by e-mail.

If you have your own WWW site about Rubik's Cube, I would be glad if you
would create a link to my URL. 
(The list is a part of my WWW information about unusual world records at 
http://www.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/~saxonia/homepage.html            )

Very Best Wishes,

Ralf Laue
