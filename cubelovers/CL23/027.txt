100 cubes, scrambled - not altered in any other way.

This is, I believe, the sixth cube sculpture that Jacob has done in
the window of my gameroom.  A seventh is currently in progress.
Previous sculptures include: "Rubik's Cube", "Merry Xmas" with a
picture of a Christmas tree, a bizarre (and not too successful)
abstract thingamabob, a pacman with several ghosts, and the Apple
logo.  I think the pacman is probably my favorite, it's a hard choice.

They are all very much worth a look...  I have pictures of them, and
I will encourage Jake to put them on his web page for all to see.

The one he is currently working on is, believe it or not, TWO SIDED.
Unlike most which he just sorta fiddles with while playing games
at my gameroom table, this one was carefully planned out in advance
with graph paper.
