Hi everyone,

thanks for all of the responses for my original inquiry about those various
cubes.

This sounds interesting. Can you tell me how to contact them? And, does
anyone know if there's a similar organization in germany?

Well, it seem s to me that all those people in the USA are much more lucky
than I am in germany. I've been going to flea markets for years (not only
for cubes, mainly for buying records), and I've never ever seen a 4x4x4 for
sale there, only lots of 3x3x3s.

Concerning Puzzletts:

I asked a friend of mine in the USA to order one for me, so I simply *HOPE*
that the above described situation isn't their regular way of doing
business. What might help is the fact that one of their retailers is in the
city where my friend lives, so he might have a chance of getting one there.

Concerning my old 4x4x4: Is there any way to fix broken center pieces?
That's the reason why I need a new one, I still have all the pieces but two
of them are broken and I have no idea if there's a way to fix them (I doubt
it, though).

Furthermore, does anyone of you maybe have a broken 4x4x4 and is willing to
sell that one? Maybe I can fix my old one with some of those pieces then.
(But probably they wouldn't fit together if they were done by different
companies).
I also could do with someone willing to sell a working 4x4x4 by the way :-)

Sorry for the length of this

Michael
