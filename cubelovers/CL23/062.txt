Indeed, while we are sharing 4x4x4 stories, I got mine (on an "extended"
borrow) while digging around in a friend's garage.  (Just hunting for
junk) I found the Rubik's Revenge in a plastic bucket behind some old
paint cans with all teh stickers peeled off.  The cube is in great
shape, but the stickers are pretty trashed (had to Krazy Glue them back
on).  But at least it works well.
