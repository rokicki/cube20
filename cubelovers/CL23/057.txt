Edwin Saesen asked for a source of "Rubik's Wahn" (5x5x5 magic cube) 
and some other rotational puzzles. 

As our busy "Time Traveler"  Jin Kim already kindly remarked, the 
5x5x5 Magic Cube and many other rotational puzzles are still 
available from me. This refers also to the Megaminx, both the one 
made in Hong Kong - sold as Megaminx - and the slightly better one 
made in Hungary - sold as Super Nova or as Magic Dodecahedron.
By the way, I do now sell the 5x5x5 cube under the name "Giant Magic 
Cube" (In Germany: "Riesen-Zauberwuerfel", in France: "Cube Magique 
Geant") , and I hope this sounds nice and doesn't create too much new 
confusion. At least the price is still the same: 40 DM or 24 USD. 
Just email me your postal address to receive your free copy of my 
mail order catalog.

Cube-Lovers: Please notice my new slightly simplified email address.
