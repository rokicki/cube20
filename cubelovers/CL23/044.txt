Subject: composition of superflip and pons asinorum

the position which is the composition of superflip and pons asinorum is
exactly 19 face turns from start.  some time ago, jerry bryan found that
this position is exactly 20 quarter turns from start, and he gave all
minimal maneuvers, up to symmetry.  one of these is 19 face turns long:

     B' D' L' F' D' F' B U F' B R2 L U D' F L U R D   (19f, 20q)

symmetry reductions for this position are much simpler (but not nearly
as good) as for superflip and/or superfliptwist.  if the first face turn
is a 90 degree turn, then by symmetry, we may suppose it is  U .  if the
first face turn is a 180 degree turn, then we may suppose it is  U2 .
i tested the two positions obtained by applying these possible initial
turns.  my program took about 6 and a half hours to exhaustively search
these through 17 face turns.  no solutions were found, and therefore the
original position is more than 18 face turns from start.

i realize that this is not nearly as satisfying as obtaining all minimal
maneuvers.  that will take about 13 times as long, but is feasible with
my current program.
