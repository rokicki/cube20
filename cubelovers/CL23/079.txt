My 2^3 has these 12 clips as I discovered when it first burst. However, I
would like to confirm something. Nine of my clips are identical, the 1/4
circle shape. However, its the other three that are causing me trouble. One
of them is identical to the other nine except that on one of the two planes
it has a very small notch cut out of it. The notch is an arc and I'm
guessing it is probably about 1 mm deep. The other two have one of the 1/4
planes identical to the first nine, but the second plane extends far
beyond, doubling the "height" of the clip. If viewed from the side which
has the extended plane it is a diamond instead of a 1/4 circle.  All of the
other internal pieces are identical to your description

        I would like to know if everyone else has these altered clips in
their 2^3s.
