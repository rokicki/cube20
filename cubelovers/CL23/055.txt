Hi everyone,

sorry if this is a boring question for most of you (and if it is, please
reply by private mail instead of to the list), but I'm new here, and my
most important question at the moment is where to get any of the followin=
g
puzzles:

Rubik's Wahn (5x5x5) (maybe also called Professor's cube, Ultimate or
Master Revenge)
Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4)
Rubik's Domino (3x3x2)
Rubik's Pocket Cube (2x2x2)
Pyraminx
Pyraminx Octahedron
Megaminx

I'd prefer sources in germany, although I doubt it that I can find any of=

them here...

Michael
