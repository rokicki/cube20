Glyph-lovers may recall I was led to that discussion by analyzing the
five conjucacy classes of spot patterns on the Megaminx.  I called
them

    0. The identity,
    1. The  72-degree twelve-spot,
    2. The 144-degree twelve-spot,
    3. The 120-degree ten-spot,
    4. The 180-degree ten-spot.

Thanks to David Singmaster for noticing this is wrong.  It should have
been

    0. The identity,
    1. The  72-degree ten-spot,
    2. The 144-degree ten-spot,
    3. The 120-degree twelve-spot,
    4. The 180-degree twelve-spot.

I'm glad to see someone's paying attention around here.
