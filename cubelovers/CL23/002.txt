Regrettably the 4x4x4 cubes seem to be sold out everywhere in the 
world.  With the 5x5x5 Magic Cubes (in Japan once sold under the name 
Professor's Cube), the situation is much better: They are still 
available from me (and as far as I know nowhere else now). Since they 
will probably never be produced again (the production cost is too 
high and the general interest too low), they will also be sold out 
soon. I shall inform the cube-lovers when this is the case.
My price of the 5x5x5 cube is 40 DM or 24 USD plus postage. 
I send my free mail order catalog (containing also many other 
twisting puzzles like the Magic Dodecahedron , the Skewb, the 
Pyraminx, Mickey's Chellenge and several books and details how to 
order) to  every cube-lover requesting it and providing a postal address. 

A few days ago, Joe McGarity complained bitterly about his 5x5x5 cube 
which fell apart. Fortunately, I did not encounter this problem 
before, and Joe  is not in my files so he has probably not bought his cube 
from me.  On the other hand you will destroy every twisting puzzle by 
twisting it with force without sufficient aligning the layers before 
every single move. Since  the 5x5x5 cube contains 98 visible little cubies 
compared to the 26 of the 3x3x3 (and 92 compared to 20 if we only 
count the freely floating ones), one should accept that it requires a 
little bit more care. 

Joe McGarity also mentioned that some orange stickers sometimes do 
not  behave according to there name. I have to admit that this 
sometimes also  happens with my 5x5x5 cubes. Furtunately 
it happens only to the orange stickers and it can be repaired easily by 
warm pressure or - better - some glue.
