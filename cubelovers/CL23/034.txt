        During the last 5 months or so I have been fiddling around with a
Rubik's Cube that I got for Toys R Us. I have become pretty good at solving
it with the layers method (90 seconds is my record so far.) My question is
this : Is the method of solving the cube corners first and then sides any
faster (once one becomes good at it) then solving it by layers? If so,
could someone please reply with a description of that method. I don't know
the names of any fancy moves, so if possible please  use F B U D L R for
the faces during specific moves and expain the other parts of the strategy
clearly. I realize this is asking alot. Thanks in advance to anyone who
replies!
