Subject: Pilloff's query about 5^3;  Korf's method.

	I've been away and have just seen email for late May and early June.
	Pilloff asks about getting the parity of the edges correct on the 5^3.
As he notes, the commutators cannot solve this.  Examining the basic moves,
one sees that the rotation of a inner face changes the parity of the edges
while conserving the parity of some pieces, but not of others.  However, the
pieces whose parity is not conserved are the pieces next to the centre and 
there are four apparently identical copies of these, so one can simulate
an exchange by a 3-cycle with two pieces the same.  
	Hence one wants to apply a rotation of an inner face.  What one does
is to move the two edges into the same inner face.  Then rotate the face.  Then
make a 3-cycle of the edges.  This produces an exchange of edges - and rather
messes up the centre pieces.  Then put things back.
	The edges go   A B C D  to  D A B C  to  B A C D.
	Because this is relatively easy to do, but messes up the centres, I
normally do the edges and corners first and then put centres in place.
	
	Re: Korf.  Someone has said it reminds them of alpha-beta pruning.
It reminds me of branch and bound search.  Both are older names for the general
process of using information about the remainder of the problem to estimate
the number of steps for a solution via a partial solution.

	Going back to Pilloff's query, I have several methods in my files for
exchanging two edges without moving anything else (I think, but that seems to
contradict what I said about parities??)
