:-((( Ok then, I'm desperate now. Is there ANYONE willing to sell a spare
4x4x4 one? I'll be willing to pay the $50 puzzletts were charging for them
(as I tried to order one from them...).
(Hey Paul, this is *THE* chance for you to get your money back, and have
your own copy of the 4x4x4 for free plus having about $24 leftover to buy
24 copies of the 4x4x4 on your local flea markets...).
But honest, if anyone ever sees one of those for sale somewhere, please get
it for me. I think my chances of ever finding one here in germany are
virtually zero, as I haven't been able to replace my own copy for six years
or so...
