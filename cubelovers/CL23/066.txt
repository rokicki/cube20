 (Sorry to have forgotten to include this in the previous message about
repairing plastic.) 

 Others (such as Drs. Christoph Bandelow or David Singmaster) might know
better than I, but I strongly suspect that there was only one specific
maker, and probably one set of molding dies, for the 4^3. If so, all
pieces regardless of by what path they reached the owner, should fit. A
good, close look, perhaps under a magnifier, would give an initial
judgment about whether a given piece should be trial-assembled. If it has
about the same amount of friction as the others, it really ought to be OK.

 The 3^3 most definitely has been made by several different companies from
their own molding dies; interchangeability is by no means assured!

 Could someone enlighten me about the 5^3? I got mine from Dr. Uwe
Meffert; I wonder whether Dr. Bandelow's came from the same set of dies?
