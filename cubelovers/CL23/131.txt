this is my sub-optimal solver, i.e. kociemba's algorithm, which
can handle either quarter turns or face turns.  (it's not yet
in its final form, but that may take a while.)

to those who are interested in my optimal solver, it will be
available soon.  it requires about 85 megabytes, so your computer
will need at least that much RAM.
