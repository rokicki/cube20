The method I use is inefficient I'm sure, but I was able to solve the 5x5x5
right away only learning one specialized move.

First I solve the 3x3x3 centers on all six sides using mostly
intuitive methods, with an occasional 3x3x3 move (turning the two
outer slices together on each twist to simulate a 3x3x3) thrown in.  I
usually work on the "corner centers" first, then the "edge centers",
just like I would on a 3x3x3.

Then I solve the "outer" corners (holding the three center slices together),
followed by the "center" edge pieces (holding the two outer slices together)
also using purely 3x3x3 methods.

Then I work on the "off center" edge pieces using moves like r1 U2 r3 U2
or l3 U2 l1 U2.  This messes up a row of center pieces but if you do
it three times total they are restored, and 5 of the off center edges
are permuted.  I usually improvise by making a twist or two to get the
edges I want to permute in the right place, followed by reversing
these afterward.  I also work with the slightly messed up centers at
times making sure that I restore them later as I permute other sets of
edges.

Finally I use one 4x4x4 specific move from Mark Longridge's page at
http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/revenge.txt which also explains the extended
notation.  (http://web.idirect.com/~cubeman/ is his main page of course).

The move I use is this:

p3:  Flip UF edge pair:   r2 (D2 l1)^2 D1 l3 r3 d2 l1 r1 D3 l3 r3 d2 B2 r1
B2 l3 B2 l1 B2 r2

On the 5x5x5, this not only flips (and swaps) the edges, but swaps two
center pieces.  But if you hold the edges you want to flip at UB
instead of UF, and do (p3) U2 (p3) U2 (p3), the edges will be flipped
and the centers restored.  You can also improvise here if you need to
flip more than one pair - messing up centers with the first flip and
restoring them with the second.  Since these edges here are swapped as
well as flipped, you can also use these moves to swap a single pair of
edges.
