My 2^3 burst into pieces while I was playing around with it a while
back. I was amazed and intrigued by the number of internal pieces it
contained; many more than the 3^3.  Anyway, after a couple minutes I
got it all put back together, and started playing with it again. One
problem: when I attempted to rotate the cube on one of the axes, it
gave me a lot of resistance. If I continued to force it, the whole
thing burst and was reduced once again to a pile of little black
plastic pieces. After a few more random tests, I examined the pieces
and noticed, as I'm sure many have, that some of the small internal
pieces are slightly different than the others.  This fact leads me to
believe that the 'special' pieces need to be oriented correctly with
respect to each other in order for the cube to work correctly.  I
would be most appreciative if someone could please inform the manner
in which they need to be placed.

        Thanks in advance,
