Subject: optimal solver for quarter turns

i have my optimal cube solver working for quarter turns.  it seems to
be as effective as the face turn version.  some minimal maneuvers
it has found are

   cube in a cube in a cube
   U' L' U' F' R2 B' R  F  U  B2 U  B' L  U' F  U  R  F'  (20q)

   six X's, order 6
   F  U' L2 F' L' D  R  U' D  L' B  U2 F' L' D' F  D  R   (20q)

   ron's cube within the cube
   F  D' F' R  D  F' R' D  R  D  L' F  L  D  R' F  D'  (17q)

and it has also confirmed minimality of known maneuvers for several
other patterns.
