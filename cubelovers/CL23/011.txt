Thank again, I found this information helpful, especially when my only
other option is to examine code in great detail in order to extract out
the general principles.

Sorry about that.  I'll stop with my questions.  In fact, no need

Very impressive.  And if you perform some longer runs and find optimal
solutions, please be sure to let us know the run times.
