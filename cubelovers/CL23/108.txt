Subject: isoglyphs

dan's idea of glyph patterns, especially isoglyphs is quite interesting.
herbert has given all the "continuous" isoglyphs.  i spent some time
looking for other isoglyphs, and was surprised at how many exist.
herbert, how did you find those?  is that part of your pattern generator?
if your program can also find all "discontinuous" isoglyphs, then i guess
there's not much point in trying to do it by hand.
