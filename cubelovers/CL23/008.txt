Where?  Montr=E9al, or Qu=E9bec City, or what?  I'm in Montr=E9al; I got =
my
5-Cube at Valet de Coeur, on the west side of St-Denis, somewhere a bit
south of Mont-Royal.  I don't know whether they still have them; this
_was_ back in 1993 (December 15, according to my records).

I paid $45.01, including tax, for my 5-Cube.  But as I remarked above,
that _was_ three and a half years ago.
