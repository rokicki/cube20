Subject: hockey puck puzzle

I recently purchased a hockey puck puzzle from Whole Systems Design, who
also brought us the Masterball.  Since I received it, I've played with for
only a couple of hours without beginning any systematic attempt at solving
it.  My initial impression is that, although it looks like is should be
very easy, it may actually be pretty hare.  Or, it's one of those puzzles
that is so easy that I'm thinking too hard and can't see the answer.  I've
never heard anyone in the cube-lovers discuss the puzzle, and I wondered if
any of you had any impressions of it.

The puzzle has the shape, size and feel of a regulation hockey puck, and is
divided into twelve wedges.  It's basically a flattened masterball in which
only the lines of longitude twist, and the lines of latitude do not.  There
are several designs, with various degrees of difficulty and redundancy.
For example, on some, there are printed hockey players, Maple leafs, or
American flags.  On my version, the wedges are numbered consecutively from
one through twelve.  The pristine version is with the numbers lined up in
consecutive order.

I'm not really interested in learning a solution from anybody, but I would
be interested in comments about whether you think the puzzle is harder or
easier than it looks.

YOu can see pictures of the hockey puck puzzle or order them at
