This statement is bogus, which is clear if you look at my chart from 1995. 
Most of the positions have a maximality of 1 this close to Start.  I was
thinking of another situation.  That is, when I looked at local maxima in
the corners only group, the inverses of the local maxima tended to have
even maximality.
