There are 57 different patterns, which have face type 42 or 4D. I don't
think I should list generators for them here. The pattern-computation
with my program took only about 3 minutes on a PC with 486 processor, so
anybody who wants could repeat the computation and then create
generators for the patterns he/she(?) is interested in.

Cube Explorer finds 56 patterns, which confirms your result.

And I thought, window machines are very popular....
