It appears that both systems are good if worked out into sufficient
detail. As far as I know, the fastest speed cubists can achieve an average
of 16-17 seconds irrespective! of whether they use corners-edges or
by-slices systems. You can look at a system which I have developed some
time ago and which enables me to solve the cube in 17 sec. on average. It
is described in detail here: http://ssie.binghamton.edu/~jirif/. I also
recommend the section on speed cubing tips.

Good luck!
