One of the oldest unsolved problems on Cube-Lovers (aside from God's
Algorithm itself) has to do with inverses of local maxima.  It seems
obvious that the inverse of a local maximum also ought to be a local
maximum.  But is it necessarily so? 

In Symmetry and Local Maxima, Jim Saxe and Dan Hoey suggest that it may
not be.  Their example is UFF, which can end with F or F' because we can
write it as UF'F'. But the inverse is F'F'U', which can only end with U'
Hence, there are very simple positions where the number of q-turns with
which the position can end is different than the number of q-turns with
with the inverse of the position can end.  If the same thing should
happen with a local maximum, then the inverse would not be a local
maximum.

On the other hand, for all known local maxima in G, the inverse is also
a local maximum.  What are we to think? 

I have some small progress.  I can report that for the corners-only
group, there are local maxima for which the inverse is not a local
maximum.  The results were obtained with my new Shamir program. 

For each position x, we define E(x) to be the set of all quarter-turns
with which a minimal process for the position can end.  As an example,
if x=UFF, then E(x)={F,F'}.  

E(x) is a subset of Q, the set of twelve quarter-turns, or equivalently
it is an element of P(Q), the power set of Q.  As such, it is
conveniently represented in my program as a bit-string of twelve bits. 
In this notation, we would say that a position x is a local maximum if
E(x)=Q or if |E(x)|=12. 

We also define S(x) to be the set of all quarter-turns with which a
minimal process for a position can start.  In this notation, for x=UFF
we would say that |S(x)|=1 and |E(x)|=2.  So the general question for
local maxima becomes the following:  if |E(x)|=12, does it necessarily
follow that |S(x)|=12?

My program calculates S(x) and E(x) as follows.  Any breadth-first
search may be characterized as calculating products of the form z=xy for
suitable choices of x and y.  Most typically, x comes from Q[n], the set
of all quarter-turns of length n, and y comes from Q[1], the set of all
quarter-turns of length 1.  But in my more general Shamir program, x
comes from Q[m] and y comes from Q[n] to form products of length m+m. In
any case, S(z) is the union of S(x) over all x which can be a part of a
product which produces z, and E(z) is the union of E(y) over all y which
can be a part of a product which produce z.  For each q in Q, we
initialize with S(q)=E(q)={q} and go from there. 

Here is a portion of a printout from my program.


 |x|  |E(x)| |S(x)|  M-Conjugacy  Positions

  0      0      0          1          1
  1      1      1          1         12
  2      1      1          2         96
  2      2      2          3         18
  3      1      1         12        576
  3      1      2          3         96

  3      3      3          2         60

As you can see, the effect pointed out by Saxe and Hoey first shows up
three moves from Start, where there are six positions unique up to
M-conjugacy where |S(x)| is not equal to |E(x)|. (Actually, three of the
six positions are just the inverses of the other three.)

The first local maxima are six moves from Start in the corners-only
group.

 |x|  |E(x)| |S(x)|  M-Conjugacy  Positions

  6     12     12          8        114

As you can see, there are 114 local maxima of which 8 are unique up to
M-conjugacy.  However, for all 8 of them, the inverse is also a local
maximum so we discover nothing new. 

The new discovery occurs 7 moves from Start.

 |x|  |E(x)| |S(x)|  M-Conjugacy  Positions
                        Classes  

  7     12      8          4        120
  7     12     10          3        144
  7     12     12         14        336

As you can see, there are 21 local maximu unique up to M-conjugacy.  For
14 of them, the inverse is also a local maximum.  But for the other 7,
the inverse is not a local maximum.  In 4 cases, we have |S(x)|=8, and
in 3 cases we have |S(x)|=10. 

Here follow summaries for local maximum up to a distance of 11 moves
from Start.
