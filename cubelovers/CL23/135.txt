Subject: Re: isoglyphs

thanks for the description of your program, herbert.  i was not so much
concerned with the algorithm the pattern finder uses (although this is
nice to know) as i was with how the user may specify patterns, etc.
jerry bryan gave a good description of this.

here are several other applications that your pattern finder should
be able to handle easily:

1. classify all "snakes".  you've already done the part where they
   consist only of faces of type 42; there's also face type 4D to
   consider.
2. confirm my results on the "czech check" problem, i.e. classify all
   patterns that have exactly eight squares correct on each face.
3. find all "partial isoglyphs".

and they are certainly many other applications.  these three come
to mind immediately.  it looks like i'll have to find a windows machine
to try out your program; it sure sounds excellent.
