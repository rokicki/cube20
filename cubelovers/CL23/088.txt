	Just for you, I have put up a new Java Octahedron at the
Rubik Gallery

	http://www.iol.ie/~goyra/Rubik.html

The new one is in the Cousteau Collection and has corner-centred
slices.There is another one in the Plato Collection with face-centred 
slices. If the one you are thinking about is deeper or it twists in a 
different way, drop me a line and I can probably brew it up for you.
