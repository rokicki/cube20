Subject: Got a new shape for a Rubik puzzle?
Date: Fri, 15 Aug 1997 17:38:13 +0100

The Rubik Gallery is a website with Java
Rubik puzzles. There are dodecahedrons,
icosahedrons, cubes, etc etc. The software 
can support any shape at all, twisting in any
way imaginable, provided the axes all meet 
at one point.

I'd like to add some more intricate and
strange shapes of puzzle, and before I sit down 
to bust my brain over the geometry, I want to 
ask the list members for ideas.

You guys are mathematical geniuses and 
I'm sure some of you already have ideas for
wierd puzzles that will never see the light of day
in physical form; perhaps ones with Penrose 
tiles as the facelets, perhaps ones that twist
in non-intuitive ways to create surprising 
shapes.If you'd like us all to see, twist and 
solve your puzzle, please tell me about it.
