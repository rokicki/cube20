Subject: 4^3 innards: There's a ball in there, but which way does it point?

 Uniquely to all cubes from the Pocket Cube to the 5^3, only the 4^3
(Rubik's Revenge) has a ball inside it. (I do hope that I don't cause
curious people to break their fragile center pieces trying to open up
theirs!) This is really a repetition of some old information, but with the
current interest in 4^3s, it seems sufficiently interesting to repeat it.
However, afaik, the questions about the ball's orientation are probably
new.

 The ball (made of at least 9 pieces plus eight screws, as I recall) 
consists of a center piece, essentially a sphere (possibly two
hemispheres) with "octants"  fastened to it; these have the geometry of
90-90-90-degree right spherical triangles, although in practical detail
they differ. Gaps between these octants define three circumferential
grooves that correspond to the Earth's equator and two orthogonal
meridians of longitude. (All 3 grooves are orthogonal.)  (Sorry for the
redundancies;  trying to be clear to everybody). 

 These grooves are "undercut" on one side, so they have an inverted
L-shaped cross-section. The cubies (center ones only, as I recall) have
feet that tuck under the extended edges of the octants' grooves; this
keeps them in place. Machinists know well of the T-slots that work with
clamps to hold work in place on machine tools; these are similar, but the
cubies are free to slide in the L-slots. 

 If I'm thinking clearly (not too sure!), the ball has a 120-degree
rotational symmetry about an unique diameter. One octant has no undercuts;
its opposite, I think, has all three edges undercut. Other octants have
some edges undercut.

 Practical details dictate that when one half of the 4^3 is rotated, one
half is definitely locked to the internal ball. However, you probably
don't know which half it is! (The mathematical folk here might find it fun
to predict which half is the locked half for any given configuration; this
might even not be a trivial problem. (As well, does the locked part always
end up in the same place when the Cube is solved? I suspect so, but am not
sure.)  (Anybody for a translucent-cubie 4^3?) 

 Is it possible to maneuver the internal ball so that it has
effectively revolved by a half turn (or quarter turn?) about any given
axis, while preserving the exterior configuration? 

 My best regards to all,
