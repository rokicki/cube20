I suggest any cube-lover who is considering going to local garage
and yard sales to not do so!  This way, *I* can get all of the 
old cubes and other puzzles!!  In fact, I've acquired TWO 4x4x4's
by this method in the last five years, as well as one of Nob
Yoshigahara's Pineapple Puzzles for only fifty cents!  The old 
lady who sold it to me even cautioned me not to eat it!

(Hmm... I'm not doing a very good job of convincing you guys to
avoid these sales, am I?  ;-)  )
