 Edwin's mention of broken center pieces reminds me of a period roughly 15
years ago when I was quite active disassembling various cubes and their
relatives; I'm fairly sure that it was these center pieces that impressed
me as being fragile. Even the wondrous innards of the 5^3 are not as
delicate, although fascinating. 

 I'm trying to remember without much success whether I actually broke a
piece. I think I did. Some plastics, I'm just about sure, can't be
dissolved by any readily-available liquids, and i think the 4^3s were made
of such material. (Acrylics can be "solvent-welded" very successfully.)
Plastic welding is possible with probably any thermoplastic (i.e., one
that can be melted after being molded), but is a skill just as is metal
welding, and needs expensive hot-air tools (others also?) designed for the
purpose.  I would not recommend it for something so precious as a 4^3,
unless you can find an expert.

 Finally, adhesives are worth considering. After all, the colored stickers
are retained by adhesive. Not at all sure, but I think I did have success
with cyanoacrylate (CA) (famous in the USA for its tradename "Krazy
Glue"). This is a strange substance that seems not to be well understood,
and it might be a good idea to learn more about it (even if you already
think you know) before trying a critical repair. At least, if your repair
is unsuccessful it will come apart, with probably little damage (no
promises!) to the surfaces. The adhesive can then be scraped off. (Of
course, you'll let it cure before reassembly...)

 As with almost any adhesive, clean surfaces are quite important. 99%
isopropyl alcohol (no longer costly; try a good drugstore) is a worthy
cleaner; rather few, uncommon contemporary plastics are attacked by it
(but the clear printhead drive rack in an Oki printer disintegrated in a
very few minutes, maybe 8 years ago). I doubt that any plastics used for
these sorts of puzzles would be sensitive to alcohol.

 Not sure of my information, but I believe that curing of CA is triggered
by absence of oxygen combined with an imperceptibly thin film of water on
the surfaces (don't try to wet them!). Very low humidity might inhibit
curing.

 For those who are really serious, the model-builders' magazines have ads
for different versions of CA adhesives; after all, models have been made
of plastics since WW II. Look into (i.e., catalog pages (Web?)) the
products of the Loctite Corp., which makes a variety of industrial
adhesives. There are other companies like Loctite, but Loctite has the
most-successful marketers IMHO. (Note that there's no "k" in "Loctite"!)

 By the way, the Pocket Cube (2^3) is a bear to disassemble and even worse
to reassemble. If it weren't for the really-good-quality polymer chosen
for it, it (more than likely) could not be manufactured. The difficulty is
in that the cubies have to be distorted ("sprung") to disassemble it. 
Whether this plastic retains its ability over many years to be bent out of
shape but not crack, I don't know! 

 All of this is offered with the best intentions; if I'm wrong about some
particular, and you're reasonably sure that I am, by all means please let
me know!  

 The brittle plastics used before WW II, in general, are a different
matter; alcohol is probably a bad idea in general. The modest amount I do
know is really off-topic. 

 I hope that this isn't too lengthy; this List seems to be willing to
carry long messages at times.
