Subject: Re: Square One

Square One is a great puzzle!

I think there is an instruction booklet, published in Massachusetts or
thereabouts, and available from Puzzlets (mgreen@puzzletts.com). I
developed a set of techniques that let me solve the thing, but I
haven't worked my notes into a form intelligible by other humans (or
by me on a bad day).
