Most of them can indeed be bought from C.Bandelow.

The only source for a 4x4x4 that I know of is Puzzletts, where I bought mine
a year ago for about 50 US $. You can see their online mailorder catalog at
www.puzzletts.com. They are based in Seattle, USA.

I myself am still looking for Rubik's Domino (3x3x2).

PS
If you or anyone else is interested in puzzles like this. There still exist
a club called "Nederlandse Kubus Club" (NKC) or Dutch Cubist Club.
About half of its members are not Dutch, despite its name, but American,
German, Japanese etc. They publish a magazine called Cubism For Fun (CFF)
three times a year, which deals with all kinds of (mechanical) puzzles, like
polyform puzzles, sliding puzzles, rotational puzzles, burrs etc. They also
organise a Cube Day once a year in the Netherlands for members with talks
about puzzles and where new and SECOND HAND puzzles can be traded, bought,
admired etc.
