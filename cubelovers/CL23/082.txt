 As to the notches Corey mentions, they might not matter, but all three
pieces I would guess might of a later design that would simplify assembly;
they are probably the last three pieces to be assembled.

 It sounds as though one needs to very careful and make sketches when
disassembling a 2^3! All of mine were bought probably around 1985 or so,
or earlier; they are old. 

 Please don't think that simply because I'm partly informed that I'm an
expert! I'm not.

 Good luck to all,

NB
