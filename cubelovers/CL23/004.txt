Rats, here is a little correction.  I think my meaning was clear from
the overall context of the note, but Dan's formula is an upper bound, so
it should read PH[n] <= 6*2*PH[n-1] + 9*2*PH[n-2] for n>2.  For depth 0
through 7, my table provided exact values.  As I hope was clear from the
context, my table included upper bounds rather than exact values for
depths greater than 7.  My apologies.
