Subject: notation for 4^3 and 5^3

	David Barr has described some moves for the 5^3 using his own notation.
In the early 1980s, I extended my 3^3 notation to the 4^3 and this can be used
on the 5^3 as well.  I described this in my Cubic Circular but perhaps it would
be useful to give it here.
	I will describe the situation for the 4^3.  On the 5^3, we don't ever
have to make a slice move of just a central layer.  Further, a combination of
4^3 and 3^3 processes will solve the 5^3, so we don't really need to label the 
central layers.
	Consider the four layers from  L  to  R.  I denote the inner layers
by  l  and  r.  So the four layers are:  LlrR.  Similarly we have four layers:
FfbB  and  UudD.  To describe a piece requires more effort than before, but
each piec lies in three layers and we can describe the piece by these layers.
E.g.  FUR  is a corner piece;  FUr is an edge piece, lying on the  FU  edge -
but there are two of these and they are distinguished as being  FUr  and  FUl
(I usually give the layers in clockwise order, but it is not essential and
there are times when it is more informative to use the other order.);  Fur  is
a face-centre piece, the one in the upper right corner of the inner four cells
of the  F  face.  If you have been paying attention, you will ask about  fur.
This is one of the body-centre cells, invisible to you unless you make a
transparent cube!
	Using the standard notation of  [F, R] = FRF'R', we find a number
of easy 3-cycles.
	[[F,R],L] = (FLU,ULB,RFU)
	[[F,R],l] = (FlU,UlB,DfR)  (I've copied this from my Circular, but
I wonder if it's right as I thought there'd be some symmetry with the
preceding??)
	[[F,r],l] = (Flu,Ulb,Drb)
In theory, these and a careful consideration of parity are sufficient to
solve the 4^3 and the 5^3.  However, the parity problem is a bit awkward.
	In my original approach, I got the corners in place and then all edges
except leaving the four edges along the  FU  and  BU  edges.  Examine the 
parity of these carefully.  If they are in an odd permutation, apply
r^2 D^2 l' D^2 r^2  which 4-cycles these four edges and moves some centres. 
Once the parity is corrected, there is little difficulty restoring the
rest of the cube.
	For the 5^3, once you have paired up the edges, one can solve the
central edges by treating the 5^3 as a 3^3 with fat slices.
	To correct a single pair of edges, one can use the following.
rrDDl'DDrr rrD'RR [[R,U],l'] RRDrr  =  rrDDl'DR'UR'U'l'URU'lRDrr  =
(UBl,UBr) (Ful,Ubl,Bdl,Ufr) (Fdl,Ufl,Bul,Ubr).  This messes up some centres,
but they are not too hard to restore.  Indeed applying  
rrUUr (uurrll)^2 r'UUrr  wil correct the  F  and  B  centres disturbed by the
above, leaving a  180 degree  rotation of the four  U  centres.
	After I had developed the notation and solution, a Peter Lees pointed
out an unexpected feature.  The exchange of upper and lower case letters is
a duality.  The dual of  URF  is  urf,  while the dual of  URf  is  urF.
This gives us a Pricniple of Duality:  The dual of a sequence of moves is
the same process on the dual pieces.  E.g., we had
[[F,R],l] = (FUl,UBl,DRf),  so  [[f,r],L] = (fuL,ubL,drF).
	This duality allows one to transfer a number of 3^3 processes to
4^3 processes and to solve the invisible interior part of the cube!
	By always moving an outer layer with its inner layer, one is
obviously simulating the 2^3.  However, if one always moves, say  R  and  l
together, one is also simulating the 2^3 in eight copies!  Ooops, one
wants to move  R  and  l'  together.  If one moves  R  and  l  together,
I think you get eight versions of the 2^3, but each is a reflection of
its neighbours!
	If you are tired of thinking about God's Algorithm on the 3^3,
try the 4^3.  I'm not even sure how to count moves.  E.g., to do  r,  one
normally does  Rr  and then  R',  so does  r  count as one move or two?
Likewise, does  Rr  count as one move or two?
	Enough for now.
