This process has improved dramatically over the past few years.  The 
materials are now quite durable.  It is not necessarily cheaper to use
stereo lithography: it is best for small parts with lots of detail-per-
cubic-inch. Simple parts or large parts are best fabricated using 
conventional machining methods. If you are making a part to be used as a
master for a mold, don't forget to enlarge the original by several percent
(depending on the final material) to account for molding shrinkage.

Despite the improvements in this field, the best stereo lithography part
is still not nearly as good as a well machined part.  It's very much
like the difference between a well printed photograph and a scanned image
printed on a good laserwriter.  Used appropriately, it is a great tool
but Bridgeport is not about to go the way of Friden or Monroe.

were once-vital makers of mechanical desktop calculators; they are now
history. -nb}
