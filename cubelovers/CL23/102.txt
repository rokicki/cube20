Subject: superflip requires 24 quarter turns

with my optimal solver, i can show that superflip is exactly
24 quarter turns from start.  this was already shown by jerry
bryan, so this confirms his result.

first some history.  david plummer gave a 28q maneuver for
superflip on december 10, 1980.  apparently there was no
improvement to this until january 1995, when i implemented
kociemba's algorithm for quarter turns.  after a lot of searching,
where i specified the initial sequence  R' U2 , it found

   R' U2 B  L' F  U' B  D  F  U  D' L  D2 F' R  B' D  F' U' B' U  D' (24q)

mark longridge notes that this sequence has a remarkable symmetry,
namely that it may be written as

   (R' U2 B  L' F  U' B  D  F  U  D'  C_-1)^2 ,

where  C_-1  denotes central reflection.

later in january 1995, i completed an exhaustive search for superflip
in 20 quarter turns, without finding any maneuvers.  i used my quarter
turn version of kociemba's algorithm, which took 29 cpu hours.  this
improved the lower bound of the diameter of the cube group to 22q.
the previous lower bound was 21q, obtained by a counting argument.

in february 1995, jerry bryan improved this result to show that superflip
is not within 22 quarter turns, and thus is exactly 24 quarter turns
from start.  this also improved the lower bound for the diameter to 24q.

we'll use symmetry to reduce the size of the search space dramatically.
consider three cases for a minimal maneuver for superflip.

1)  it contains a half turn (i.e. two consecutive quarter turns of the
    same face).
2)  it does not contain a half turn, but contains two consecutive turns
    of opposite faces.
3)  otherwise.

in case 1, as in the face turn situation, we may suppose that the first
three quarter turns are  U R2 .

in case 2, by cyclically shifting, we may suppose these two turns are
the first two.  if they form a slice (U D') then we may take the
first three quarter turns to be  U D' R .  if they form an antislice,
then we may take the first three quarter turns to be either  U D R  or
U D R' .

in case 3, i claim that we may find three consecutive turns of mutually
adjacent faces.  otherwise, if the first two faces turned were  U  and  R,
then we'd only be turning  U , R , D  and  L .  however, edges cannot
change orientation when only these faces are turned.  thus the claim holds,
and by cyclically shifting, we may suppose that these three faces are
U , R  and  F .  by symmetry, we may suppose that they're turned in that
order.  now we have eight cases:

     U  R  F      U  R  F'     U  R' F      U  R' F'
     U' R  F      U' R  F'     U' R' F      U' R' F'

we can eliminate two of these by using inversion.  inverting the case
U' R  F  gives  F' R' U .  conjugating this by the appropriate cube
reflection gives  U  R  F' , and these three turns can be cyclically
shifted to the beginning of the maneuver.  similarly, the case  U' R' F
can be transformed to the case  U' R  F .

thus ten cases remain.  to show that superflip is not within 22q of start,
these cases must be searched through 19q.  my program took 22 hours to
searched these completely, and no maneuvers were found.

iw would be nice to know all the minimal maneuvers for superflip.  the
branching factor is about 9.37, so an exhaustive search would take about
22 * (9.37)^2  hours, which is about 80 days.  this is feasible, but is
definitely a long term project.  i've already searched the first case,
(beginning with  U R2) which would seem to be the most likely, through 21q.
this took about 147 hours.  i expected it to find a lot of maneuvers, but
it only found 4, in two inverse pairs.  the first is equivalent to the
maneuver above, and the new one is

   U  R2 F' R  D' L  B' R  U' R  U' D  F' U  F' U' D' B  L' F' B' D' L' (24q)
