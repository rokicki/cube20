You have experienced a problem which has led me to purchase a total of
FOUR 2x2x2 cubes.  Not even of my own undoing either.  In two cases,
friends attempted to play with the cube and disassembled them, and were
unable to properly reassemble them.  I have pieces of each in separate
boxes, minus several pieces each.  In one case I dropped it, it flew
open, and I DID manage to reassemble it properly.  But it ALSO fell
victim to a careless reassembly by a friend who also carelessly
disassembled it.  That one I reassembled AGAIN and gave it to someone. 
They later told me they "broke" it, which means it's in pieces and since
they live 450 miles away, I can't exactly help them.  I have a fourth,
still in its bag, untouched by human hands.  Oh yes, and I bought a
fifth one (actually, it was the fourth, so the untouched one is
technically the fifth) but I had to return it and get another one (the
fifth) because it had been disassembled before and reassembled
incorrectly (the pieces only turned on one axis).
