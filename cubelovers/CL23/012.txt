 One cure might be to take a solved cube (more convenient...) and remove
all the red stickers; carefully clean off the adhesive, perhaps with 99%
isopropyl alcohol, and paint the surfaces neatly with the type of paint
used for plastic model kits. I have also thought of removing the stickers,
cleaning all the adhesive off both the stickers and the cubies, and then
reattaching the stickers with a different type of adhesive.

 These are just ideas, and I hope no source of trouble.

 My best to all,
