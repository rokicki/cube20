Subject: Re: isoglyphs

Mike,

I'm glad you like glyphs, and I'd also like to know about the other
isoglyphs (by which I don't want to minimize my interest in the wealth
of optimal processes you've been producing!).  In particular, we've
seen isoglyphs with all corner types except D (which we know is
impossible) and with all edge types.  So we might wonder if all the
glyph types not involving corner type D are achievable.  But I know
there is no isoglyph of type 4D (stripe).  Are there others?

One superset of the isoglyphs that might be worth looking is the
partial isoglyphs, in which all faces are either the same glyph or
blank (type 00).  This allows corner type D (laughter is
4 type D4 + 2 type 00).  These even come in continuous varieties
(slice is 4 type 4D + 2 type 00).  Is there a partial isoglyph pattern
for every glyph?

And what about chiral partial isoglyphs, for which isoglyphicity is
redefined to require the same handedness for orientable patterns?  I'm
pretty sure all the isoglyphs we've seen so far are chiral, but are
there isoglyphs achievable only non-chirally?
