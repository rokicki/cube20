Subject: Megaminx a.k.a. Supernova

Has anyone ever written a simulation of the Megaminx for the PC?
 
I'm thinking about Megaminx moves and I'm on the verge of writing
a simulation from scratch (starting with my file for GAP), to
help myself to compose sequences for patterns.
 
I am particularly interested in processes for the 10-spot and 
12-spot.
 
Ultimately I should write one, something with coarse face movement,
algebraic move entries like  ( F+ B- )^12 with whole megaminx
rotations.

This is interesting to me as it lies outside of recorded cube
literature.

I've also managed to compile Mike Reid's ANSI C cube solver for
MS DOS using DJGPP. It makes good use of DPMI.
