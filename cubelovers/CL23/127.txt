        I recently got my hands on a 5x5x5 from Dr. Christoph Bandelow,
however, I'm am at an almost complete loss as to how to solve it.  I think
that if I ignore the center row in all axes then it is pretty much a 4x4x4,
but if I then treat it as a 4x4x4 the center axes get all screwed up. 
        I would really like to know if there is a site that has a
description of the solution to a 5x5x5 or if someone could describe it to
me in a message. Thanks in advance.
