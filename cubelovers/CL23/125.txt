I'll take a crack at this one.  (The program is great, by the way.)

The basic mode of the pattern generator allows you to specify a pattern
for one of the 3x3 faces of the cube, and the program finds all the
positions (unique up to symmetry) where each of the six 3x3 faces has
this same pattern.  It doesn't really matter which colors you specify in
your one face, since you are really only specifying a pattern.  For
example, I have played with corner facelets and center facelet all one
color and edge facelets all another color, or center facelet one color
and all the edge and corner facelets another color (yields the 6-spot),
etc.

The patterns I have played with have very few (or sometimes, no) 
solutions.  I don't know what happens if you choose a pattern with many,
many solutions (maybe there really aren't all that many such positions,
given that all six 3x3 faces have to have the same pattern). 

There is an expanded mode which I haven't played with much yet where you
can give up to four 3x3 patterns.  Each of the six faces on the cube
then has to have a pattern that matches any one of the (up to) four
which you specified.

The so-called pattern editor I have described seems to operate
essentially instantaneously.  But having generated the position, you can
then ask the program to find a near-optimal solution using the Kociemba
algorithm.
