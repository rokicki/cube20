Actually, the Spaceball that you talk about is still in existence of
sorts.  I have three Spaceballs.  Actually, they were known as the
Spacetec Spaceball Avengers.  Those are no longer produced.  They've
been replaced by the newer model, the SpaceOrb 360.  Not to get too far
off subject, but the SpaceOrb is used by some people to play Quake.  You
can't beat a good Mouse and Keyboard for Quake, but the SpaceOrb's
multiple axes of movement does allow for some interesting
possibilities.  Due to its 3D nature, I think the SpaceOrb would be a
natural extension for the solving of 3d puzzles in graphical
environments.
