 It's not likely that there are two or more designs of the 2^3; sorry if I
misled anyone. I might have been lucky; however, I don't recall needing to
sort the clips. 

 This >is< something to look out for if you disassemble a 2^3.

 It's likely that the clips for the swiveling long blocks would be
different from those for the rigid extensions of the "jack". Less likely
is that the different cavities used to mold several clips at once had
different shapes where the differences had no effect on operation, but
anyone familiar with such mechanisms would be able to tell.  The
mechanical engineer on this project has the answers!

 Sure hope this isn't memory fade; I'm going on 62...

 My best regards to all,
