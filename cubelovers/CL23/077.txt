 My, it's been a while since I opened up mine. I hope I remember. What
perplexes me (I was about to say, "puzzles me") is that I don't recall how
it could be assembled wrong; surely there aren't two internal mechanisms
that differ in some details? 

 Perhaps it would help if I describe the internal structure (from memory).

 The basic structure that I remember is built on a "jack"; it's basically
mutually-orthogonal extensions from a center, so to speak; like a physical
embodiment of the axes of 3-D Cartesian coordinates. What I recall is that
three of these, all adjacent, have a square cross-section; the other three
have a circular cross-section, with a diameter significantly smaller than
a side of the square.

 Each of three round projections fits into a hole through a rotating
long, thin square prism. (In the vernacular, square sticks with round
holes through their centers.) In mine, I am just about certain that all of
these had the same length.

 Each cubie (all were identical internally) is hollow, but cut away with
concave arcs that allow them to turn with respect to their neighbors.

 The cubies are kept together by 12 "clips". These fit into the cutout
arcs; when you assemble the Cube, you put two cubies next to each other
(they touch) and fit this "clip" so that it keep s them together. To
install it, you move the clip away from the imaginary geometrical center
of the whole puzzle.

 As I recall them, the "clips" are essentially quadrants (1/4 circles).
They consist of two parallel planes with a gap between them; the sides of
the cubies fit into this gap. The parallel planes are joined at the inner
edges.

 When the whole Cube is assembled, the square extensions of the "jack", as
well as the square sticks that turn on the other ends of the jack serve to
keep the clips from moving toward the center of the whole Cube.

 This is a structure that could not be either assembled or disassembled if
it were made of rigid materials. It's only because the cubies (at least!)
are made of a strong plastic that has good mechanical spring properties
and can be harmlessly deformed (within limits), that it is possible to
make this structure.

 >>> It's conceivable that the cube was misassembled so that one or more
"clips" didn't actually straddle both of its cubies. When assembled, there
should not be any gaps between the cubies, and all movement should be
reasonably free of friction.

 I'd love to know how these were assembled in the first place; did the
mfr. have special tools to temporarily deform the parts? Did the
assemblers develop very strong hand muscles?

 Btw, it's a challenge to describe the innards in words.

 I hope this helps!
