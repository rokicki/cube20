I believe so.  Those "special" serve the same purpose as the protruding
octants on the 4^3 internal ball -- to anchor one of the blocks in
each plane.  Otherwise, one of the planes of "clips" may be offset 
45 degrees (not obvious from the outside), and the other planes
become unturnable.  Make sure that one weird clip is in each
plane before assembly.

I hate formication.  It should be abolished entirely.
