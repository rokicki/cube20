"Chirality" is Lord Kelvin's word for "handedness" as in "appearing in
two mirror-image varieties."

A "chiral isoglyph" is one in which the handedness of the glyph is
taken into account in testing for isoglyphy,* so that the glyph
appears only in one variety.  Neither Mike's original isoglyph nor the
                                                       *..     ..*
two you found are chiral isoglyphs--they all have both *** and *** .
                                                       ***     ***

Mike used "achiral" for an isoglyph that fails to be a chiral
isoglyph, though I would tend to use "non-chiral".  I would rather use
"achiral" for a situation that lacked chirality, as in an isoglyph of
a mirror-symmetric glyph.

[* Thanks to Allan Wechsler for inventing the word "isoglyphy".  His
   alternate term, "isoglyphism", is still looking for a good use. ]
