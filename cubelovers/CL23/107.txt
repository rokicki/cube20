Subject: patterns with 24-fold symmetry

i've finished computing minimal maneuvers for those positions with
24-fold symmetry.  these positions were classified by dan hoey and
jim saxe in their note "symmetry and local maxima."  there are 24
such positions; they form an abelian subgroup of type 6, 2, 2.
we may take as generators  superfliptwist, pons asinorum, and 6 H's.
of these 24 positions, 4 have 48-fold symmetry; i'll include these
here as well.  the other 20 positions occur in 10 pairs which differ
only in orientation; i.e. there are 10 "patterns".

some of these maneuvers were found earlier by others; i'll acknowledge
this to the extent that i'm aware of it.  in addition, most maneuvers
were found by kociemba's algorithm, and a few by my optimal solver,
which is based on the same ideas.

some of these maneuvers have some symmetry.  i find the maneuver for
superfliptwist composed with pons asinorum especially interesting.
it is composed of: twists of the  U  or  D  face, and antislices
along the R-L and F-B axes:

     U (FB) D (RL) U' (F2B2) (RL) D' (FB) D (RL) D (F'B')

therefore, when we conjugate this maneuver by the cube rotation  C_U2,
we get the same maneuver!  the maneuver for superfliptwist composed with
6 H's has the same type of symmetry.
