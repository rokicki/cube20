I've got another interesting story, too, about my two 4x4x4 cubes.
Earlier this year, by sheer coincidence, I happened across two Rubik's
Revenge cubes at a local hobby store.  Each of the cubes was authentic,
and still in the (unopened) original box.  I easily slapped down my $12.95
(USD) for each cube, needlessly to say.  :-)
