Subject: 4^3 and 5^3

	I've just seen a comment about the 5^3 saying the writer had problems
with the four pieces at distance 1 from the center.  My approach treated
both these and the pieces ate distance 2 from the center in the same way.
We know that the commutator of two slice moves on the 3^3 produces two
3-cycles of the centres.  Applying this idea to the 4^3, we find that
[f,r] gives two 3-cycles of central pieces, one on each face.  By turning
one face and then inverting, we get a 3-cycle of central pieces, two being
in one face.  E.g.  [[r,b],U] = (Fur,Ubr,Ubl).  A similar result holds if
we combine any two inner moves, so we can replace the  b  above by a central
slice on the 5^3 to obtain a 3-cycle of the pieces at distance 1 from the
central piece, while the process directly gives us a 3-cycle of the pieces at
distance 2 from the central piece.  Although tedious, these moves mean that
once one has the corners and edges in place, the rest of the problem is
easy - though very tedious - it generally took me about an hour to do the
5^3, assuming I could get the corners and edges correct without making too
many mistakes.
