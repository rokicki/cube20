I thought that was most natural, but there are certainly at least two
others.  In my article of 22 Dec 1993 in
ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/cube-lovers/cube-mail-11 I mentioned how to
show they are different, at least in the 3^4 hypercube.  I didn't go
into enough detail to determine "most interesting"--can you expand on
what you mean?  By the way, do you know if this is the Kamack and
Keane model?  I've never seen their paper, and I never figured out how
to read Charlie Dickman's document.)

Wow! I can verify it for the most obvious natural extension I can
describe.  We could form the 3^d Rubik's ball by taking the unit ball
B_d={z in R^d : |z|<=1} and some sufficiently small constant c, and
cutting the ball with the hyperplanes

     P_i,s = {z in B_d : z_i = s c} for each index i in {1,...,d},
                                    for each sign s in {-1,1}.

We arrange that all rotations are allowed that keep these pieces
inside the unit ball (perhaps enforcing this by attaching extensions
in the shape of a cube). It's then easy to see that a representative
2-face

     {z in B_d : z_3 > c, z_4 > c, ..., z_d > c}

can be rotated by mapping

    (z_1,z_2,z_3,...,zn) -> (z_1 cos th + z_2 sin th,
                             z_1 sin th + z_2 cos th,
                             z_3, z_4, ..., z_d).

That is a very surprising observation to me, too!  Hands up anyone who
_isn't_ surprised!!

In fact, I think it may be worse (geometrically, if not
combinatorically).  For instance, I expected that a cubical hyperface
of the 3^4 could only be turned by rotating the cube about an
orthogonal axis.  But it looks to me like you could rotate the cube
around any axis you like.  Maybe you have to eventually rotate it so
it occupies it's original space before you rotate a perpendicular
hyperface, but I'm still somewhat annoyed that you can put it in weird
orientations in between.

What I haven't proven is that say, any decomposition of the ball into
3^d pieces that admit (d-1)-face rotations will also admit 2-face
rotations.  If you've got that, it would pretty much support your
conclusion, but I don't know how to verify it off-hand.
