Subject: Administrata and a reference

The administrata is that Alan Bawden has asked me to take over
cube-lovers-request for a few weeks, while he is recovering from
surgery.  After seventeen years of running cube-lovers, he deserves a
vacation, but I would rather he find someplace more pleasant to spend
it than a hospital.  I'm sure we all wish him a speedy recovery.

I will be adding and removing addresses and filtering out abuse, but I
will not be updating the archives or the collection of reader
contributions.  As always, send to cube-lovers-request@ai.mit.edu for
administrative services.

The reference is for Nicholas Bodley, who in one of his very
informative messages on Rubik's Revenge raised questions of the
possible orientations achievable by the internal sphere without
changing the exterior.  I answered that question in my message on
"Invisible Revenge" on 9 August 1982.  The sphere can be placed in any
of 24 orientations, and I showed how to do so.  If we consider the
sphere modulo its functional symmetry (fixing one corner of the cube)
we will distinguish only 8 of these orientations.  I also mentioned
how to determine which of these 8 orientations the interior sphere is
in on a physical cube, without disassembly.  See

for details.
