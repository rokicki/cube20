for most, it isn't a complete list.  the main reason is that it's too time
consuming to calculate all of them.  (perhaps it is also too voluminous,
but i'm not sure.)

on an individual basis, here's what i gave:

superflip: all 20f maneuvers, up to inversion, cyclic shifting, and
           conjugation by cube symmetries.
           all _known_ 24f maneuvers, up to the same transformations.

pons asinorum: all 12q maneuvers, up to conjugation by cube symmetries.
               all 6f maneuvers, up to conjugation by cube symmetries.
               (the inverse of each maneuver is the same as some
               conjugate by a cube symmetry.)

superflip composed with pons asinorum:  all 20q and 19f maneuvers, up to
                                        inversion and conjugation by cube
                                        symmetries.

for the H-symmetric patterns (24-fold symmetry), i was less ambitious.
for each, i gave a single minimal maneuver in each metric.  also, in the
cases where there is a maneuver that is minimal in both metrics, i gave
such a maneuver.

how did you know what i'm working on next?  ;-)
i also plan to examine AC-symmetric positions and X-symmetric positions
(if i understand your terminology correctly).  however, there are so
many of these (124) in the X-symmetric case, that i probably will have
to settle for sub-optimal maneuvers.
