Subject: composition of superflip and pons asinorum

my optimal cube solver has also found all minimal maneuvers for the
composition of superflip and pons asinorum.  this was previously done
by jerry bryan, so the purpose here is to confirm his results.

up to symmetry, there are 10 maneuvers of length 20q, which occur in
5 inverse pairs.  they are

     U  R  F  D  R  U' D  L' U' D  F' B2 R  L' D' F' L' B' R'     (20q)
     U  R  U  F  U  F  B' L' F  B' R  L' B' R  L' U  F' U' R' U'  (20q)
     U  R  U  F  D  R  L' B' R  L' F  B' L' F  B' D  F' U' R' U'  (20q)
     U  R  D  B  U  R  L' F' R  L' F' B  L' F' B  U  B' D' R' U'  (20q)
     U  R  D  B  D  F' B  L' F' B  R  L' F' R  L' D  B' D' R' U'  (20q)

this agrees exactly with jerry bryan's results.
