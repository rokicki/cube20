You are quite in luck.  There is a great source of puzzles in Germany.

Christoph.Bandelow@rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de
bandecbv@rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de

I'm not sure which is correct, or maybe they both work, but Dr.
Christoph Bandelow has a catalog available for people to buy various
puzzles.

He should have all of the above puzzles available for purchase, except
the 4x4x4, 3x3x2, and the Megaminx.  All of them are rather hard to
locate.  Especially tough is the 4x4x4 because of its high demand.  I've
been looking for one as well for a number of years.  By many accounts,
there are no more for sale anywhere except maybe private collections. 
And if you own one, you're not likely to part with it anyway.  So good
luck.
