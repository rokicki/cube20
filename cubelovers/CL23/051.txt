The puzzle contains edge pieces and center pieces, all with the same
thickness as the puck.
There are always two center pieces which together form the inner
circle.
In this case there are 12 edge pieces which together form the outer
ring. Simpeler pucks might contain less than 12 edge pieces, but always
an even number.
The possible moves are:
1. rotate one center piece with half of the edge pieces 180 degrees
   relative to the other center piece and the other half of the edge
   pieces.
2. rotate the edge pieces around the center pieces, always multiples of
   30 degrees, or 1/12 of a circle (or more if there are less edge
   pieces)

I know the puck with 6 edge pieces is near trivial to solve.
I haven't tried the other ones yet.
