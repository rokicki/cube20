Hi everyone,

can anyone tell me a way to disassemble an Alexander's Star without
breaking it? I've had this one for YEARS (about 10 or so), and never
really found a way to do it. It's very difficult to use, and I think a
little lubricationg will do wonders :-)

On a different note, I visited Christoph Bandelow on this wednesday,
and it was absolutely incredible to see the range of puzzles he has
(although he said he's not collectiong anymore). Anyway, I got quite a
few nice things from him, including a 5x5x5 and two replacement center
pieces for my 4x4x4 (YES!!! YES!!!!!!) :-)

Michael

PS: This doesn't mean I'm not interested in a second 4^3 one anymore -
I would feel more comfortable with a second 4^3 to have a chance to
replace broken pieces myself, but at least now it's working again.
