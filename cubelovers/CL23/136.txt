Subject: partial isoglyphs

dan recently introduced the concept of "partial isoglyphs", in which
some faces are solid, and the others are glyphs of the same pattern.
i looked into this a little and didn't find much.  only the case
of two opposite solid faces seems to have many possible glyph types,
although some of these possible types may have many solutions.

here's what i found

6 solid faces: start
5 solid faces: no possibilities
4 solid faces:
   other two faces opposite:  types 02, 0D and 04 are possible
   other two faces adjacent:  type 0D is possible
3 solid faces:
   mutually adjacent:  type 02 is possible
   not mutually adjacent:  types 01 and 0D are possible
2 solid faces:
   adjacent:  types 01, 02, 0D and 03 are possible
   opposite:  many possible types 
1 solid face:  types 01, 02 and 0D are possible

but it seems like herbert's cube explorer program can settle this
matter completely.  maybe he, or someone else wants to investigate
this.
