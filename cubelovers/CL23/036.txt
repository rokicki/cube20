Dear Cube-Lovers,
How to solv U-slice if D-slice and UD-slice have been solvd yet? I remember
that in about 1994 when I was a child I used 3 or 5 algoritms (with mirrow
variants). But now I don't remember the way. 
I read cube-lovers arhives (from #0) and step by step find out some
algoritms. But before I will be able to solve Cube I lose a lot of
interesting in
archive messages. I just can't try a lot not having solved Cube!
Please help me. A need just "1. U2DFTU'RD'   2. UR'D2L'D2 3..." without
comments.
Or, may be somebody have created such type FAQ which is accesible for ftp?
