I have another suggestion, which might be slightly less likely to require
explanation to a newcomer.  I know how to *pronounce* it, but I'm not sure
how I would recommend *spelling* it.  (Considerations include terseness,
ease of typing -- which is of course not the same thing!, and likeliness to
be mispronounced by a reader.)

The pronunciation is three-bye, four-bye, five-bye, ...

Possible spellings include:
	3by, 4by, 5by, ...
	3-by, 4-by, 5-by, ...
	3x, 4x, 5x, ...
	three-by, four-by, five-by, ...
