Subject: Re: isoglyphs

perhaps i am missing something, but doesn't

     D2 R2 U2 D2 R2 U D   (12q, 7f)

produce an isoglyph of type 4D ?

are there any isoglyphs of type 21 or 23 ?  i haven't found any.
each has three possible patterns:

...     .*.         .*.
***     .**         ***
***  ,  ***   and   *.* ,

.*.     ...         ...
.*.     **.         .*.
*.*  ,  *.*   and   *** .

i hadn't even considered chiral versus achiral isoglyphs.  indeed,
all the "continuous" isoglyphs given by herbert are chiral.
achiral isoglyphs certainly exist, for example

     D2 R2 U' B' L  B  U  B  L  F2 R  D' L2 U2 B2 D    (22q, 16f)

of type 11; pattern

*..
***
***

and others can be derived from this.  i suspect that there is no
chiral form of this isoglyph, but i'm not absolutely certain.

another interesting note is that the inverses of the "continuous"
isoglyphs are also isoglyphs; in fact the same pattern, perhaps in
a different orientation.  however, there is at least one (probably
more) isoglyph whose inverse is not an isoglyph.  instead of giving
it right here, i'll challenge other readers to find it/them.
