Subject: Patterns on larger cubes (Was Re: isoglyphs)

 Perhaps many List subscribers have realized that (unless I'm very
confused!) while the current highly-evolved discussion of patterns
(isoglyphs, etc.) pertains only to 3^3s, there must be enormous "worlds to
conquer"  when one considers [maneuvers] to create patterns on the 4^3
(Rubik's Revenge) and the 5^3.

 I understand little of the current discussion about isoglyphs (even if
the term itself makes sense); nevertheless, it's delightful to see such
discussions going on, and I have great respect for those who do understand
and can contribute. (I wouldn't have it any other way!)

 It's perhaps of interest to consider a Theory of Mechanisms, in which it
would be possible (eventually) to design an optimum set of innards for,
say, a 5^3, or to rigorously prove that what exists is optimal.
Connections with topology and kinematics would be not at all unexpected. 
Close connections with CAD would also make sense.

My best regards to all,
