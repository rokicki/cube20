 Reading David Singmaster's recent posts, it seems almost obvious to me
that (for the ambitious, which I'm definitely not!), computer simulations
that are unhindered by real-world mechanical constraints and opacity can
permit manipulation of the normally-hidden (and physically-nonexistent)
internal cubies. It's very likely that a new collection of maneuvers would
need to be developed for this.

 I haven't thought much about coloring the internal faces of the outer
cubies...

 Incidentally, if this weren't the cube-lovers' List, I would have split
that first sentence into a few shorter ones.

 Sorry if "cubie" is not the most-preferred term; should be no great
problem.

 On another topic, it seems to me that an ideal device for controlling a
computer-simulated Cube (or other similar puzzle) would be the Spaceball,
a ball that you can grip. It senses torque around all three mutually-
orthogonal axes, as well as "translational" force along those axes. It's
not a consumer item; not sure it's still being made. I'm reasonably sure
of the tradename. It was/is used with workstations. "Spaceball" sounds
much like the name of a puzzle.

 (I expect some astute reader to tell me that the MIT Media Lab did just
this thing 5 years ago!)

My best to all,
