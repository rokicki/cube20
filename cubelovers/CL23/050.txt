    [Jan de Ruiter:]
    The puzzle contains edge pieces and center pieces, all with the same
    thickness as the puck.
    There are always two center pieces which together form the inner
    circle.
    In this case there are 12 edge pieces which together form the outer
    ring. Simpeler pucks might contain less than 12 edge pieces, but always
    an even number.
    The possible moves are:
    1. rotate one center piece with half of the edge pieces 180 degrees
       relative to the other center piece and the other half of the edge
       pieces.
    2. rotate the edge pieces around the center pieces, always multiples of
       30 degrees, or 1/12 of a circle (or more if there are less edge
       pieces)
    
    I know the puck with 6 edge pieces is near trivial to solve.
    I haven't tried the other ones yet.

Thanks for the description -- Pete ("Karen Angelli") provided an
identical one in a private reply.  But this is still incomplete.  Are
the obverse and reverse of the individual pieces distinguishable?
Suppose I manage to flip every other edge piece over in place (not
sure this is possible).  Does it then look solved?  Or do the two
sides have different colors or a distinguishing mark or something?

I haven't tried it, but I can't imagine that this puzzle would be very
difficult.
