Subject: Underwater cube solving

	I've been away from my email for some time and have just seen the
message of 3 Apr 1997 from Pete Reitan via Karen Angelli.
	In England, we also had some underwater cube solving.  This is probably
in my Cubic Circular somewhere, but I can't find it.
	A lecturer in mathematics at the open University, Pete Strain, got
interested in the Cube when I brought early examples to the Open University in
early 1979.  He got married about that time and took on the name Strain-Clark,
and his wife was also interested.  They performed underwater for Anglia
Television, probably in 1980.  This is a regional television and I've never
seen the program.  They had similar problems to Pete - in particular, her
face mask leaked and she couldn't see for the last 15 seconds and had to
solve the cube by memory!
	I've looked through my Cubic Circular again and can't find that
I ever included the above.
	Some day I may assemble another issue, mostly of anecdotes.
