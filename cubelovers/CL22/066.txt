Professor cracks Rubik's cube mystery

LOS ANGELES (May 27, 1997 5:43 p.m. EDT) - A University of California
computer science professor has solved the long-standing mystery of Rubik's
cube, university officials said Tuesday.

Richard Korf found a way to line up the colored squares of the cube in an
average 18 moves and a maximum of 20, officials said without explaining
exactly how it is done.

Rubik's cube, launched in the 1970s by the Hungarian Erno Rubik, became a
worldwide phenomenon, with people spending hours trying to manipulate it
into color-coordinated rows.

Korf is due to reveal his method at a national conference on artifical
intelligence July 28 in Providence, Rhode Island.
