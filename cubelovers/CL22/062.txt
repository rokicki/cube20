Thanks alot for the info on Triamid (no major difference).

Pete Beck asked:

  How is tangle different.  I know it is plastic and the strings are    raised 
but is the puzzle different?

The Oddzon version has only nine pieces, which are double-sided. For these 18 
sides, all pieces from the original tangle, except the six with a straight 
yellow line are used. Of the 9 puzzle pieces, 3 have straight red on both sides, 
3 have a straight green, and 3 a straight purple. The result is a somewhat 
easier puzzle, at least it's solveable without computer aid.

Back to the Triamid: Has anyone ever tried to build a large one out of several 
small?  To build a 4x4 one would need three Triamids to get enough connector 
pieces. The question is, would the puzzle work, or would it be too hard to 
disconnect a 3x3 top from a 4x4 base?
Me, i'm seriously considering buying 2 extra.
