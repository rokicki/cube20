Hi everybody!

I recently purchased a Rubik's Triamid, Matchbox version.
Do any of you know whether that version differs from the new Oddzon release? The 
Oddzon Tangle certainly is different from the Matchbox Tangle.
The leaflet that comes with the new Oddzon Tangle says the following puzzles are 
in the new series:
Tangle, 2x2x2 Mini Cube, Rubik's Cube, Snake, and Triamid.
I'd like to know if they have re-released even more of the old stuff.
None of them are available where i live (Copenhagen, Denmark)
Also, if anyone has a Rubik's Hat they's like to part with, i'd be real 
interested.

Philip K
