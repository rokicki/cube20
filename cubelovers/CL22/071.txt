What do the skeptics have to say about the 20 move solve?  It was said
that in theory it could be done; but is it really possible?  

Does anyone know how long time wise it took Richard Korf to solve it
using the 20 move method?

I'm just a 15 year old who can solve the cube so I don't know much about
theories or mathematical patterns.  So if someone can explain it to me
that would be great.

If it all that is claims to be, then I can't wait to know how to use the
method.
