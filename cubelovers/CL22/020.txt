 Realistically, IMHO, the only practical thing is to buy another. There
are several makes in existence, and they have at least minor detailed
differences in dimensions. I'd love to say something different!  If,
however, you can find someone who's an expert plastic welder (no kidding),
such a person might be able to do a repair.

 In any event, good luck!
