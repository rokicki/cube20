Hi, Cube-Lovers!
My name is Chistoph Bandelow, and I am new in this exclusive club.
Having finally aquired a modem and the necessary software a few weeks 
ago, I'm still overwhelmed and confused by everything. I have read 
all the contributions from July 1996 till now and the complete "Index 
by Subject". 

To begin with something, I would like to make some remarks about the
Skewb, especially the wonderful Skewb variations made by Tony Fisher.  I
suggest to call them "Fisher's Icosahedron", "Fisher's Dodecahedron", and
so on..Owing all of these puzzles, I am very enthusiastic because of their
originality and first-class quality. Just in case you are considering to
acquire one or the other from him: Tony Fisher is a very reliable, modest
and decent person.

THE SKEWB has been first described to a larger public by Douglas R. 
Hofstadter in the July 1982 edition of Scientific American. This 
treatise is included in Hofstadter's book "Metamagical Themas" (Basic 
Books 1985 and Bantam Books 1986). It was here where Hofstadter 
suggested the name 'skewb' as a reminder of skew and cube. 
One of the wonderful features of the Skewb is that we don't have to 
quarrel how to count single moves: no trouble with outer layer moves 
versus slice moves or with 90=B0 moves versus 180=B0 moves, there is just 
one type of move rotating one half of the Skewb by 120=B0 against the 
other half. 
>From 1985  to 1988 I had an intensive correspondence with Ronald 
Fletterman where I used the following 

NOTATION: Hold the (ordinary cubical) Skewb such that there is a 
unique Right upper corner, Left upper corner, Front upper corner and 
Back upper corner. R, L, F and B respectively denote a clockwise 120=B0 
rotation  of the associated half cube (as seen from the outside). R', 
L', F' and B' denote counterclockwise turns. Small letters r, l and 
so on are used for rotations around the bottom corners. Though this 
notation is short and handy, it is probably not as good as the one 
used by D. J. Joyner in his Skewb page (see 
http://www.nadn.navy.mil/MathDept/wdj/rubik.html) 
But I stick on my old notation, especially after Ronald Fletterman, 
used this notation in two papers in CFF (Cubism For Fun, the 
newsletter  of the Dutch Cubist Club) in which he provides an 
enormous collection of Skewb maneuvers, see CFF 17 (May 1988) and  
CFF 18 (September 1988). The square center pieces of the Skewb can 
only rotate pairwise and only by 180=B0, not by 90=B0. Ronald 
Fletterman's collection covers these "invisibles". He, the 
perfectionist,  gives maneuvers for all 5 possible cases: 2 
neighboring squares, 2 opposing squares, 4 squares all but 2 
neighborings, 4 squares all but 2 opposing, all 6 squares. However, 
all his other maneuvers (those for the corner pieces of the Skewb) 
pay absolutely no heed to the orientation of the center pieces. Every 
short and elegant solution method for the new Skewb variations of 
Tony Fisher or for the beautiful round versions of the Skewb like 
Mickey's Challenge or Sonic's Puzzle Ball or the Mach Balls require 
maneuvers for the corner pieces which do not twist the center pieces. 
Some of those maneuvers are given in my 80 page booklet about 
Mickey's Challenge or about Sonic's Puzzle Ball or on the leaflets 
accompanying some other puzzle balls from Meffert. Here is a 
selection:

SOME SUPER SKEWB MANEUVERS. 

1. (FL'R)^6 (18)  twists the 2 neighboring squares on the left side. 

2. R'BLF'L'FRLB'R'FRF'L' (14) achieves the same thing. 

3. FfRr'f'FfF'R'f'rRF'R' (14) twists the top and bottom square. 

4. (RF')^2 (R'F)^2 (8) twists the four top corner pieces: 

... the right and front one clockwise, the left and back one counter-

... clockwise, in short: (+R) (+F) (-L) (-B). 

5. R'FR' (F'R)^2 fF'f (Ff')^2 (14)  twists 2 corner pieces: (+R)(-L)

6. rF'rfR'F'rfR'r'F (11) twists the top front corner piece clockwise 

... and exchanges (3-cycles) the 3 neighboring corner pieces, 

... in short: (+F) (L,R,f). The very last notation does not precisely 

... describe the effect of the maneuver since the orientation of the

... three corner pieces is not given. A remarkable and fundamental 

... difference between Rubik's Cube and the Skewb is that the Skewb 

... does not allow pure corner-3-cycles: It is impossible to achieve 

... (L,R,f) without any other corner piece change! 

CALL TO CUBE-LOVERS: I'm convinced that the maneuvers given above, 
especially number 2, 3 and 5, may be improved. Who can give shorter 
maneuvers or a good maneuver for (+L) (+R) (+f) ?

PROPAGANDA. One last remark: I don't want to offend the good rules of 
netiquette by doing any kind of advertising here. But to avoid 
unnecessary questions and loss of time, allow me to say that I will 
send my free mail order cube catalog (1996 edition, this is still the 
latest) to everybody who requests one and provides his postal 
address.
