Subject: Underwater cube solving

	I found the story in my Cubic Circular 1, p. 16.  Pete promised to
marry his lady when she got down to 60 seconds, which wasn't too hard as she 
was already at 70 seconds.  Her name was Chris Clark.  The TV recorded only
showed a lot of bubbles!  One would need a underwater TV camera to get 
antything interesting.
