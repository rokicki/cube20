I'd say they're pretty uncommon.  I've been looking for one for about 5
years now.  Would you mind sending me the address and phone number of
the company that is selling them.  I've also been looking for a "Rubik's
Magic Create the Cube."  It was originally described as a 'Level 2'
Rubik's Magic.  I snapped the strings on mine and haven't seen one
since.

Thanks,
