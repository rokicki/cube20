Because of interest I've run into from friends elsewhere, I'm planning to
collect the (useful) messages from this thread and hang them on a (possibly
short-term) page on my website.

Of course, this all assumes that there are no objections from the
"participants"; in particular if you are in the CC list above, I'm
currently planning to include one of your messages.  (Similarly, I'll be
including any future "relevant" messages, again assuming the poster doesn't
object.)

Any other (relevant) matter is welcome.
