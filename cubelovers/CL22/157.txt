 In a recent issue of EE Times, the newspaper for EEs, was a short article
that points out that we are getting closer to having force-feedback
interfaces for our (personal) computers; these already exist in research
machines.

 In such interfaces, you can feel the virtual objects; there are electric
motors (or the equivalent) to generate computer-controlled forces
according to the positions of the various parts of the mechanism; combined
with data about the position and the location of the virtual object, the
motors turn on when you "make contact" with the virtual object.

 I see no reason why we couldn't define a virtual cube with on-screen
graphics to let us see it; we would then have the sensation of
manipulating it. There would be no need for a mechanism (sad to say!) to
hold the cubies together. (I love the innards...) 

 Of course, there would be a reset button, and provisions to preset any
arbitrary configuration. This would take some of the fun out of cube
manipulation, naturally. 

My best regards,
