I hope that I am not alone in that much of Prof. Korf's description is a
little over my head.  Perhaps the Professor or others can recomend books
on AI or group theory to those of us whose education only goes as far as
trigonometry.  This is a very interesting subject and I find myself
wanting to understand it better.  Is there anything out there aimed at
the beginner?  If so I would very much like to see it.
