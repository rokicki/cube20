I do not think there is really any difference of the sort that Prof. 
Korf was talking about.  I have done extensive breadth-search searches
with both the quarter-turn and face-turn metrics (although I have done
more work on the quarter-turn). Dan has posted what I will call
"syllable analyses" for both metrics.  Dan's "syllable analyses" (e.g.,
FB=BF, etc., where FB and BF are our syllables) provide an upper bound
on possible branching factors. The observed branching factors are
extremely close to Dan's upper bounds for both metrics out to the levels
I have searched. Hence, I see no advantage either way. 

Dan's syllable analyses are essentially based on short relations. 
Observed branching factors deviate from Dan's tight bounds only to the
extent that there exist longer relations which are not taken into
account by Dan's formulas.  The fact that the bounds are tight simply
reflects that there are not very many longer relations, at least out to
the level that has been searched.

Far enough from Start, there will be a major break in branching factors,
and the break will occur closer to Start for the face-turn metric than
for the quarter-turn metric.  This break in branching factors will be
reflective of longer relations which do not simply contain shorter
relations. And again, these longer relations will be shorter in
face-turns than in quarter-turns.  But that's just the way the metrics
work.

We seem to be degenerating into one of our periodic face-turn vs. 
quarter-turn arguments (I am a confirmed quarter-turner because
quarter-turns are conjugate).  But this reminds me of something I ran
across in Singmaster which I found curious. Singmaster is a face-turner,
but he nevertheless defined the length of a position as the number of
quarter-turns from Start for the position.  In other words, he did not
identify the number of moves to solve a position with the length of the
position.  Is his definition of "length" standard in group theory?  If
so, we would have only one length for each position, although we could
have several metrics for "number of moves from Start" (face-turns and
quarter-turns are by no means the only possible metrics).  In the same
vein, is the term "diameter" reserved to mean the maximum length for any
position so that the diameter is unique, or do we have one diameter for
quarter-turns, another diameter for face-turns, etc.?
