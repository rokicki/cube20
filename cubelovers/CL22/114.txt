Take a look at some of the web pages about the 4x4x4 or 5x5x5 cubes;
they have a sequence of about 20 moves for swapping two edge pieces.
I used to have it memorized.

Here's what I would do now (when I don't have the sequence memorized).
Turn either the 4th or 2nd horizontal slice one quarter turn, then use
your normal moves to put this slice's edge pieces back into place.
You will end up with a solvable number of pieces out of place on the
top.

I don't understand what ARA'R' means.  When I solve the 5x5x5 cube, I
end up using mostly one type of sequence that moves three pieces.  I'm
not very familiar with 5x5x5 notation, so I'll describe a notation
that can describe the sequence.  I learned this notation from a book
on the 4x4x4 that I bought in the early 80s.

A number (1-5) refers to a slice move that causes a vertical column of
pieces on the front face to move to the bottom face.  1'-5' are the
inverses.  L or R refers to a move that will move the bottom row of
pieces on the front face to either the left or right side.  Here's a
sequence that moves three corner pieces:

  1 L 5 R 1' L 5' R

The shorthand for this move is 1L5, because the rest of the moves can
be predicted from the first three moves.  If you replace 1 and 5 with
any two other columns (and possible swap the L and R moves), you can
design a sequence that will move 3 pieces of any type.

1L5 and 5R1 will move three corner pieces.
1L3 and 5R3 will move three edge pieces.
1L2, 1L4, 5R2 and 5R4 will move three off-center edge pieces.
2L3 and 4R3 will move three center near-edge pieces.
2L4 and 4R2 will move three center near-corner pieces.

A lot of the time, the three pieces you want to move aren't in
locations that correspond to one of these sequences.  In that case,
make a move that puts the three pieces in the right place for one of
the sequences, do the sequence, then undo your original move.

For all I know, this is just another way of describing the moves that
you are making.
