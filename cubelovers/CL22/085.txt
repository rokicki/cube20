First, the term "heuristic function" is not Rich's invention for the
lower-bound function of A*.  I learned that term in 1970 from
Nillson's textbook on Artificial Intelligence.  And second, even if
"pruning tables" and "filters" are essentially nothing but heuristic
functions, that still does not make the algorithms "basically
identical".  From the description, I think Rich's heuristic functions
are quite a different type from what you use (though I do not
understand either exactly yet).  I also suspect that the difference
between A* and IDA* (which has not really been explained here yet) may
play a larger role than you give it credit for.

But thanks for the description of your algorithm (some of which has
previously filtered into the archives), and the offer of a program
(what language?).  My guess is that your heuristics have a good chance
of being more effective at finding optimal solutions for random cubes
than Rich's, though perhaps some ideas from Rich need to be
incorporated.

Thanks very much for the explanation.  It agrees with my understanding
of the paper, as far as that goes.  But do you have a succinct
explanation of what makes IDA* more tractable than A*?  That's the
part I missed.

Now when Rich found his first ten random cubes (well, he doesn't _say_
they're the _first_ he tried, but they had better be) took under 18f
moves each, you mention

First, we know 18f is not optimal, because the 12-flip is proven to
require 20f moves exactly (unless Mike Reid made a mistake, or I
misunderstood).

But we _can_ say there's at most one chance in 1024 that the first ten
random cubes you pick will all be closer than the median to solved.
So this demonstrates Rich's claim that the median optimal solution is
very likely 18f.
