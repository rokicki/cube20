I have been reprimanded.  

And justly so.  Of course the first step to science is to retain an open
mind.  My comment was not to be taken 100% seriously, but to hopefully
point out with a bit of humor that the burden of proof here is on those
making the claim.  In retrospect the post should have read, "Bulls**t
:-)"  With the additional challange of proving me wrong invited and
openly reviewed by myself.  I would be delighted to be proved wrong in
this matter, but I maintain that the evidence should be carefully
examined and discussed as a group before we jump to a concensus on the
subject.

Having climbed out of the hole I dug for myself, I will now remove my
feet from my mouth and check out what Prof. Korf has to say.

By the way, I will do PR work for interested corporations and
politicians for a fee.
