It has 12 panels and 5 rings, and was marketed as "Unlink the Rings".
I have one with the original packaging.  They are hard to find;
I only found mine through a very lucky occurence (and paid only $1
for it!)

I am still searching for a "Make the Cube."  I also have a broken one.
Perhaps I should just take the string from one of my normal Magics
and transfer it.
