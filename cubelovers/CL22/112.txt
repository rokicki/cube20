I found that the solution book for the Rubik's Revenge was also a very
useful tool to solving the 5x5x5. The only pieces I had to figure out
myself through trial and error were the interior face pieces that have
edge contact with the middle piece (i.e. four pieces that including the
center piece would make a Plus "+" sign).
