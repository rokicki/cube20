Good explanation, but I guess I still am unclear on one point.  It seems
that Kociemba's algorithm finds sub-optimal solutions which are either
very close to optimal (or may actually be optimal -- by accident, as it
were), and finds them very quickly.  It also seems that Kociemba's
algorithm will eventually find optimal solutions if it runs long enough,
but "long enough" may be a long time.  I think that I am hearing that
"long enough" means that phase1 has essentially subsumed phase2 to the
point that phase2 contains no moves.  Is this correct -- that is, does
the Kociemba algorithm guarantee us an optimal solution only after the
solution is derived entirely in phase1?  If not, at what point does the
algorithm itself guarantee an optimal solution?
