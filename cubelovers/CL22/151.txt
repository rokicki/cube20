	Hi.

	I've got a bunch of Java cubes and puzzles of
other shapes (deodecahedron, icosahedron, octahedron)
located at

	http://www.iol.ie/~goyra/Rubik.html

At the moment they've got only a visual interface. I
am looking at the possibility of giving you a way
to trace and replay movements using standard 
Cube notation.


	Trouble is, many of these shapes have never been
given a standard notation and I don't want to invent a 
crude one. Can anyone tell me where to find the
definitive work that has been done in the area of generalising 
the notation?
