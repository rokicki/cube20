Anybody have any good moves for super-skewb centers?  That is, ones
that either twist centers in place, or move them without twisting.
Tony Fisher, in England, makes some wonderful puzzles based on the
Skewb, but in shapes such as an Icosahedron, or Dodecahedron, or
Rhombic Dodecahedron.  These are all actually Super-Skewbs.
