If one can show that the cost values have a property such that they will
prune all nodes at levels less then h0, then I would agree with your
assessment.  However, I do not see why that should necessarily be
the case as the costs examined at lower levels could be overly optimistic
with respect to h0.

For example.  Let's say that we are iterating through the search and
our current depth limit happens to be 5.  Now we examine the first node
at level one.  Your analysis above assumes that this node (and all others
at this level for that matter) will be pruned.  Now let's also say that
I now consult the pruning tables and compute an overly optimistic lower
bound cost of 3.  We now add the 3 to our current depth of 1 and since
3+1<5 we would not prune that node.  So if this can occur, I think one
is actually looking at evaluating b^(h0-1) additional nodes in the worst
case.

While I believe your phase1 algorithm is certainly ID (iterative deepening),
I do not believe it is A* since the depth limit is not based purely on
the cost.  Given an A* search algorithm, certain hard conclusions can
be proven (such as the guarantee that the first solution found is optimal
if an admissible heuristic is employed).  I don't know if these same
conclusions can be proven with the phase1 algorithm.  However, I agree
that from a purely practical standpoint and considering this particular
application of the algorithm to the cube problem this *may* not be an
important distinction.  But I don't think that conclusion has yet
been fully established.
