   At any rate, I'm willing to make this program available to interested
   parties (BTW, its written in C++).  I would prefer to upload it to an
   FTP site if possible.  Is anyone aware of an FTP site available for use
   by cube-lovers?

This seems like a good time to remind everyone that there -is- a
Cube-Lovers FTP archive for situations such as this:

  ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/cube-lovers/contrib

I'm always happy to put more things into this directory, provided you don't
make it too much work for me.  The ideal contribution consists of a single
file (preferable a gzipped tar file) plus a -brief- description for the
README file.  You've got to figure out how to get the file to me in some
reasonable way -- letting me pick it up from some other anonymous FTP site
is easiest.

If you make me think too hard, for example by expecting me to compose the
description for the README file, or by making me pick out the Cube related
files from some larger collection, then I'm liable to never get around to
doing it.

I also reserve the right to redescribe, repackage, rename, recompress or
totally reject your contribution.
