In phase1, the heuristic function is
h(x,y,z):=max{h1(x,y),h2(x,z),h3(y,z)}, where for example
h1(x,y):=min {lenght of maneuvers m with m(x,y,z)=(x0,y0,z0)|z<495},
and (x0,y0,z0) denotes the goal state.
>From this it follows, that |h(x,y,z)-h(x',y',z')| <=1, if (x',y',z') is
a state which is the result of a single move applied on (x,y,z).
In particular this is true for the initial state (x,y,z) and any
depth-one node (x',y',z'). The cost f of the depth-one node  is f=1 +
h(x',y',z'), and from the above we have h0:=h(x,y,z)<=1 + h(x',y',z')=f
When we now make an iteration with an iteration depth d and d<h0, we
have
d<h0<=f, but d<f means, that the depth-one node will be pruned, q.e.d.

Obviously the first solution is optimal for phase1, because the
maneuverlength of a later solution cannot be smaller.
