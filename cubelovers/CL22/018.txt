I know many of the people on this list are collectors, and are always 
looking for new and unique cubes.  I also figure there may be some people 
on this list that would like to own one, but have yet to acquire a 2x2x2 
cube.  Taco Bell has a number of toys for sale commemerating the Star 
Wars re-release.  One of these toys is a 2x2x2 cube.

FYI,
