 If I keep my facts straight, Deep Blue used quite a good supply of
special-purpose ICs ("chips"), designed specifically for searching ahead
in chess. Scanning the recent messages in the List about searches, as a
relatively-uninformed amateur, I wonder whether some special-purpose ICs
could be designed to help with some of the algorithms you are discussing.

 These days, there are some excellent software tools for designing
practical Application-Specific ICs (ASICs); while I have no specific
details to offer, it seems likely that part of the computational task
could be offloaded onto hardware. The recent emergence of single chips
that contain lots of memory and some processing should be considered, for
it is likely that such chips would be much more useful/powerful than those
with little or no memory. 

 By any chance, is IBM looking for new sub-worlds to conquer?

My best regards to all,
