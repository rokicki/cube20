Several people asked how to get the so-called "Super-skewbs" (the name
is from an earlier cube-lovers message, not from Tony Fisher.)  They
are made by hand, by Tony Fisher (see below).  He has about 9 puzzles,
and says he plans to have some new ones later this year.  He makes
them by glueing parts onto Skewbs.  The results, I think, are
excellent.  One corner broke off of one of the puzzles I got, but is
easily glued back on.  They move nicely (which means, I think, that
the original Skewbs moved nicely.)  He says he just buys them in
shops, and then makes the transformations at home.  They mostly cost
around $60 - $75 (American), although a triple 5x5x5 is $90, and a
mini-octahedron is $40.  I don't know if these are permanent prices;
they may change if prices of the cubes (or plastic) goes up.  besides
the skewb variations, he as "Siamese" versioin of both the skewb and
the 5x5x5 cube (ie, he combines two into one; I don't have these, so I
don't know exactly how the Siamese Skewb works.)  He also has a Triple
"Triamese 5x5x5", and a mini-octahedron based on the Tetraminx (which
I also want to get a copy of.  His address is:

	Tony Fisher
	9 Cauldwell Hall Road
	Ipswich, Suffolk, IP4 4QD, Great Britain

I guess I ought to put the list of puzzles for clarity:

Skewb variations:
  Icosahedron 	       - $60
  Dodecahedron 	       - $60
  Rhombic-Dodecahedron - $60
  Octahedron	       - $55
  Siamese Skewbs       - $60
  Mental Block	       - $75  (A strange object: looks like a 1x3x3
block, with 9 even squares on the top and bottom, but the edges are
cut by an 'X' in the middle, so there are 2 triangles and 2 pentagons
on each edge.  When twisted, it makes all sorts of strange shapes.)

Siamese 5x5x5		- $75
Triamese 5x5x5		- $90

Mini-Octahedron (based on Tetraminx) - $40

Dave Singmaster pointed out that the instructions for "Sonic's Puzzle
Ball", but Christoph Bandalow, has some super-skewb moves in it.  I've
just glanced at it, so I haven't had a chance to try them yet.  He
seems to have about 3 moves that twist pairs of squares (and some
triangles), of lenght 10, 14 or 18.
