I have a Color Quickcam camera attached to my PC, and I was wondering
how difficult it would be to write a program that would take two
pictures of a cube (to cover all six sides) and determine the cube
position from the images.  The positions could then be fed into
another program (maybe one of the WWW cube solvers) for further
processing.

Is there any source code out there that does image recognition of cube
positions?
