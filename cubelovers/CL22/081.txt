Prof. Korf's solution to the Cube sounds like it basically maps all
possible iterations within a given number of steps.  Once you know all
the possible combinations given the maximum number of turns, you can
then just compare a scrambled cube to the map and see if it falls within 
one of the available templates.  And of course, the more moves you
calculate out to, the longer it's going to take due to the geometrically
increasing number of possible movements.  

Yes, the solution, as the good Professor explains it, is definately over
my head, but I think I know how he is going about solving it.  Brute
force.  Of course, the DETAILS of how it's done are over my head as
well.  Ultimately I think the cube is more satisfying if I solve it
myself, even if it takes me 3 minutes and dozens of twists.
