Subject: Re: Extra-long Rubik's magic rings

	Several people have remarked about having broken strings on a
version of Rubik's Magic.  When one of mine first came apart, I thought
it would be impossible to get it back together correctly as I thought
there would be some critical weaving of the strings.  However, once
one examines it closely, one sees that no magic is needed.  Simply rethread
the strings along the correct paths and it works.  All one needs is a small
screwdriver to stretch the end of a loop over the corner of a panel.  So
it is much easier to assemble or to reassemble than one initially thinks
and I'd encourage anyone who has a little manual dexterity to remake a
broken one using strings from other ones.
