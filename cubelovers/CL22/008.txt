Aaron Coles:
 The Rubik's tangle I bought is 3x3 and in that puzzle there 
are no tiles with a straight yellow. The version of the Rubik's 
tangle which that page you gave describes is not, as far as I 
know, marketed in stores.
 Here is my solution to the store version I bought:
Notation: green=color 1, purple = color 2, red = color 3, 
yellow = color 4. Each tile will be denoted by a 4-tuple
(a,b,c,d), where 
a is the color number of the straight rope,
b is the color number of the quarter circle rope,
c is the color number of the twisted rope (the one going from
 one side to the opposite which is not straight),
d is the color number of the looped rope (the one going from
 one side to an adjacent side which is not in the shape
 of a quarter circle). 
The "orientation" of a tile will be
0 if the straight side is lined up vertically on the left,
1 if it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the 
 orientation 0 position,
2 if it is rotated 180 degrees clockwise from the 
 orientation 0 position (the straight side is lined up vertically 
 on the right),
3 if it is rotated 270 degrees clockwise from the 
 orientation 0 position.
I labeled the (2-sided) tiles arbitrarily 1-9, with f for front 
and b for back. They are as follows:

tile 1
f (1,3,4,2), b (1,4,2,3)
tile 2
f (1,4,2,4), b (1,4,3,2)
tile 3 
f (1,2,4,3), b (1,2,3,4)
tile 4 
f (3,1,2,4), b (3,2,4,1)
tile 5
f (3,4,2,1), b (3,4,1,2)
tile 6 
f (3,2,1,4), b (3,1,4,2)
tile 7
f (2,4,3,1), b (2,1,3,4)
tile 8
f (2,1,4,3), b (2,3,1,4)
tile 9 
f (2,3,4,1), b (2,4,1,3)

Mathematics of puzzles:
 In general, let X be a collection of n interlocking puzzle pieces.
Assume that there is a solution to the puzzle for X
which uses every element of X.
Call G a "subpuzzle graph on X" if there is a subpuzzle 
of interlocking pieces constructed from a subset Y of X
such that G is a graph with vertices labeled by the subset Y
of X and two vertices are connected by an edge if and only 
if the corresponding pieces fit or interlock in this subpuzzle.
A "solution" to the puzzle will be a connected subpuzzle 
graph on X having n vertices associated to a solution. 
 For almost every jigsaw puzzle I've seen and for the Rubik's 
tangle puzzle, a solution to a puzzle is a Hamiltonian graph. 

Algorithm for the Rubik's tangle: We shall construct
a subpuzzle graph on the Rubik's tangle pieces as follows:
Notation: Label the positions of the puzzle as 
9-2-3
|  |  |
8-1-4
|  |  |
7-6-5
step 1: Pick a tile (18 possible choices)  and put it in
position number 1 with orientation 0. Draw a corresponding 
vertex and label it with this tile's 4-tuple. 
inductive step: Assume that k tiles have been placed in positions
1 through k and each tile fits with its neighboring tiles, k<n.
Pick a tile which fits with tile k in position number k+1
(in some orientation). Draw a corresponding vertex, label 
it with this tile's 4-tuple and it's orientation. Draw an edge from 
tile k+1 to each neighboring tile.

Solution to Rubik's tangle:
3421,2 - 1342,2 - 3214,3
  |              |           |
1243,2 -  2431   - 3124,1
  |              |           |
2143,2 - 1324,3 - 2413,2
