The unsolvable instance is FreeCell game #11982.  And you are correct
to point out that a computer program has proven the unsolvability of
this particular instance.  It is a curious fact that only one of the
32000 instances turned out to be unsolvable.

I am familiar with Baker's game and as you mentioned, it is harder
to win at than FreeCell.  It would be fairly simple to adapt my
program to Baker's game and it would be interesting to compare performance.
As I mentioned, my program uses a sort of "hash cache" for duplicate
node checking (as the search space for FreeCell is a graph, not a tree).
There is a flaw in this mechanism as some false hits can occur and effectively
over prune the search tree.  I believe that was why I was unable to solve
approximately 300 of the 32000 instances.  I don't know if that flaw would
be amplified in Baker's game where there are fewer paths to a solution as
compared to FreeCell.  Unfortunately, eliminating this behavior would
require a complete overhaul of the duplicate node checking mechanism
as opposed to a simple "quick fix".

At any rate, I'm willing to make this program available to interested
parties (BTW, its written in C++).  I would prefer to upload it to an
FTP site if possible.  Is anyone aware of an FTP site available for use
by cube-lovers?
