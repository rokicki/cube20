Subject: RE: Strange new Rubik puzzle in Java

	What Goyra is describing as 'Strange new Rubik puzzle in Java' is
clearly based on the fact that one can inscribe a cube in a dodecahedron
using 8 of the dodecahedron's vertices.  This is pretty well known and one
can probably see versions of it in some of the books on polyhedra.
Adapting a cube to having a dodecahedral appearance was certainly considered
in the 1980s, thoguh I can't remember if anybody ever made them for sale
- e.g Greg Stevens or Jean-Claude Constantin.  I don't have any in my 
collection, so I'd be grateful to hear hpw to get one.
	Incidentally, a 2x2x2 version is being made in Spain in the shape
of Mickey Mouse's head (and perhaps Donald Duck's head).  These are
supposed to be coming on the market here soon.
