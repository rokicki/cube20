Hi

I made a new release of my puzzles.
They are available for Windows 3.1 and above at
http://megahertz.njit.edu/~bagleyd/
as
winpuz64.zip
source is available also for each puzzle.

For X
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu//pub/Linux/games/x11/strategy/xpuzzles-5.4.1.tgz
Also available at the site below, you may need a mirror though to get it from
ftp.x.org since they only allow 50 users.

They puzzles include:

I updated all the txt/manual files. So they now contain a little history
of the origins of each with references.

Fixes for the Masterball

Auto solve capability for Panex thanks to Rene Jansen <RENE.R.J.JANSEN@RCC.nl>
(based on the algorithm in Quantum Jan/Feb 96).
Panex with 3 tiles on each side is known to be solvable in 42 moves
The version here solves it in 45.  Rene and I would both like to improve this.

For the X versions I added: Username, concurrency check, configure
