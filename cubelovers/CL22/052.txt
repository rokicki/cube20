As I recollect the 12 panel Magic Rings was called the Master's Edition. 
Since they have been out of manufacture for quite awhile suggest you buy it
when you see it.

The 8 panel edition has been released by ODDZON and is in some toy stores
along with some other Rubik's items.

As some of you might remember there also was a 4 panel magic sold.  If you
have ever taken one apart you know that any multiple of 4 is possible. 
Awhile back I posted intstructions on CUBE LOVERS for restringing and or
making your own variant.  The panels are just 2 pieces of plastic with the
design sandwiched in bewteen.  They are not glued but held together by the
strings.


Does anybody know where to get I BET YOU CAN"T ?? a variant made with
hexagon panels.



THE FUTURE IS PUZZLING,
BUT CUBING IS FOREVER !!!
