As it so happens, I have a spare 'cube' which met with unfortunate
incident a number of years ago.  Let's just say it involved a hacksaw
and a misguided attempt at.... modification.....

Anyway, if you're so inclined, I have no problems mailing you the center
piece if you really want it.. But like someone else said, you'd do just
as well buying a new one.  And besides, the center piece may turn out to
be just a little bit off kilter.  I think it was a knock-off.
