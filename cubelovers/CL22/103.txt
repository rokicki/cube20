I think the two phase approach is relevant to a larger class of problems
than just the cube, or for that matter, combinatorial puzzles in general.
In fact, I think the two phase aspect is what is commonly referred to
as "bidirectional search".  When it can be applied, it has the potential
for reducing search complexity from O(b^d) to O(b^(d/2)).  That is to
say that it can cut the exponent of an exponential search in half.

My earlier comment was more in regards to leveraging specific knowledge
of cube groups.  I'm not sure that specific knowledge of cube groups is
highly applicable to Korf's work as this seems in conflict with the
desire to develop general search methods that are domain independent.
I suspect that he might consider this "cheating" with respect to the
thrust of his work having greater applicability outside combinatorial
puzzle problems.  But if the goal is to develop a highly optimized
Rubik's cube solver, then inputting specific knowledge of the cube
problem is reasonable.

Although I don't yet fully understand the pruning tables used in Kociemba's
algorithm, I suspect they are different than Korf's tables (which I do
understand), especially with respect to how they are applied to pruning
the search.

I have a hunch that combining Korf's heuristic methods with a Kociemba
style two phase approach (a.ka. "bidirectional search) could result in 
a more effective cube solver.
