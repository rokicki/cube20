	Those of you with Java browsers, powerful
PCs and fast Internet connections may want to 
revisit my Rubik Gallery at

	http://www.iol.ie/~goyra/Rubik.html

I have just installed Rubik cubes of all sizes up to 11.
I intend to maintain the Gallery as the world's
largest collection of "Rubik" puzzles, a place where 
you can play with that obscure puzzle you were never
able to find in the shops. Any suggestions as to what 
should go in it next, are welcome.
