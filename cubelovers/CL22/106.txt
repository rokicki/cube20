Hello,

I'm proud to say that after significant quantities of blood, sweat, and
tears, I have finally solved the 5x5x5 cube.  I used some techniques from
the good old 3x3x3 cube as well as some general techniques I've found
useful over the past (often of the form A R A' R' where A is a set of
rotations preserving one face and R is a rotation of that face).  One
problem I faced along the way and have not been able to solve to my
satisfaction is an issue of parity.  I often put the big cube in a state
where exactly two "equivalent" off-center edge pieces on the upper face
were interchanged with one another.  They had the correct orientation, I
simply needed to switch the two pieces.  I would like to know if anyone has
an effective means of dealing with this situation.

It was immediately apparent that the ARA'R' technique would not work
because interchanging two pieces requires a change in parity which the
ARA'R' won't produce.  I tried interchanging "identical" pieces from the
interior of the cube and then returning to the top face to see if any
change had resulted.  This was met with only marginal sucess-- after enough
fiddling I was able to produce two pairs of interchanged, properly
oriented, off-center edge pieces on the upper face which I could, after
some further manipulation, handle with an ARA'R' scheme.  Still, this isn't
very satisfactory to me because I don't much like the idea of having to
randomly interchange pieces until I produce a workable situation without
any more definite strategy.  Undoubtedly, most of you have been more
successful at this endeavor than I have, so I'd appreciate any available
wisdom.

Thanks,
Mark Pilloff
