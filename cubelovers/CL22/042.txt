>(which
>sound very interesting indeed), i would like to mention to those whom
>it might
>interest, that Greg Stevens, Seattle, is making various types of cube

>I have one of his catalogues, and have also received from him an "Off
>Center
>Cube".
>His designs, about 12 different, seem to be in the following
>categories:
>1) Bandaged Cubes, made from standard 3x3x3
>2) Shape modifications, made from standard 3x3x3
>3) 1) and 2) combined
>4) Bandaged Square-1
>5) Bandaged 4x4x4 (where did he get the raw material???)
>6) Shape variations of Pyraminx, i.e. "Pyraminx Star"
>
>The "Off Center-Cube" is a 3. It is well made, and very tough to solve.
>In fact

>disguised as edge pieces.
>Last but not least - Greg also is a very reliable and decent person.
>If anyone's interested i shall forward his postal address to the list.
