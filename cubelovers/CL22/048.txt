	Those of you with Java browsers may want to
see a new Rubik puzzle I've just posted at

	http://www.iol.ie/~goyra/Rubik.html

It's a dodecahedron sliced on 8 axes. I would not have 
believed that it was possible that you could take the
20  evenly spaced corners of a dedecahedron and find 
8 of them that are ALSO evenly spaced - but there
it is.
