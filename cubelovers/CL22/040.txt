Hi everybody!

I'm Philip Knudsen, and i live in Copenhagen, Denmark. Last year i found out
about this list, and read most of the old messages. The past few months i have
subscribed to the list using a free email account at my library.
Now for my 1st message: Since the talk is of Fisher's Skewb variants (which
sound very interesting indeed), i would like to mention to those whom it might
interest, that Greg Stevens, Seattle, is making various types of cube variants.
I have one of his catalogues, and have also received from him an "Off Center
Cube".
His designs, about 12 different, seem to be in the following categories:
1) Bandaged Cubes, made from standard 3x3x3
2) Shape modifications, made from standard 3x3x3
3) 1) and 2) combined
4) Bandaged Square-1
5) Bandaged 4x4x4 (where did he get the raw material???)
6) Shape variations of Pyraminx, i.e. "Pyraminx Star"

The "Off Center-Cube" is a 3. It is well made, and very tough to solve. In fact
i still need to find out how to turn the center pieces, which by the way are
disguised as edge pieces.
Last but not least - Greg also is a very reliable and decent person.
If anyone's interested i shall forward his postal address to the list.
