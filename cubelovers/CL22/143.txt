Where are you able to find 5x5x5 cubes that don't instantly fall apart? 
I have had nothing but trouble with mine.  Is there more than one on the
market?  I am only aware of the one manufactured in Germany.  Not only
have I never been able to solve it, but I have never been able to
scramble it.  It simply crumbles away in my hands.  The orange stickers
seem to have a habit of fleeing the cube in terror.  (It's always the
orange ones on any cube that fall off first.  Has anyone else noticed
this?)  At any rate, if there is some other source for these cubes or if
I simply got a bad one, someone please let me know.  Wei-Hwa Huang's
post has made me want to pick it up and try it out, but so far, mine is
only for looks.

Joe
