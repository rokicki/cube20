I suppose it depends upon where one is willing to draw the line with
respect to so called "weak methods" (i.e. search techniques that don't
rely on information about the problem domain).  If the methods are specific
only to group theoretic puzzles, I think they are interesting and useful,
but somewhat less relevant to advancing the state of the art of weak methods
as applied to larger classes of problems.  I'm under the impression that
Rich's research is focused on the latter, as opposed to the goals of the
typical hard-core cube enthusiast.

By the way, if someone is aware of a paying full-time research position
focusing only on solving the cube, and related, puzzles, please let me
know and I'll sign up tomorrow! :)

Having said that, I think the table optimization you described is a very
clever way to take advantage of symmetries for these types of problems.
Eventually, I hope that the knowledge gained by this, and related, threads
can be synthesized into a new algorithm that surpasses all previous cube
solving program.  Now that would be exciting to cube-lovers!
