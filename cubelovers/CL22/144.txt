Hello Greg
I read Korf's work about macro learning and in particular his work about
the cube. Also I don't have a program that learn to solve the 3X3X3 cube I
have succeeded to write a program that learn to solve the 2X2X2 cube.
I have used the Micro-Hillary algorithm:
reference can be found in http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shaulm/
The basic problem in order to finish this work for the 3X3X3 cube was the
lack of a 'good' heuristic function. 
Maybe after the last achievements in the heuristic field this algorithm can
be used to solve the 3X3X3 cube.

Shai
