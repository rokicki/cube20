i guess i didn't ask this explicitly, but i certainly thought about it.
there's no reason to preclude the existence of such shortcuts.
i posted the antipodes for this subgroup, so anyone who wants to search
for shortcuts can do so.  in fact, herbert gives a shortcut for the
first position.

yes, it would be interesting, but it would not improve the upper bound.
recall that i already gave the upper bound of 29 face turns.  to do
this, one must verify that the antipodes in stage 2 can be avoided by
choosing the last turn in stage 1 properly.  specifically, if
sequence R'  reduces the position to the intermediate subgroup
<U,D,F2,R2,B2,L2> , then so does  sequence R .  the last face turn
in stage 1 is always a quarter turn of either F, L, B or R.  so we
can always change the direction of this quarter turn, if necessary.
my program verified that by making the proper choice, we can avoid the
positions at distance 18f.

however, the same approach can probably improve the upper bound in
the quarter turn metric (currently 42q).  here the antipodes in stage 2
are at distance 30q.  in fact, the diameter of the whole cube group
is probably less than that (24q ???), so most of the positions at large
distance have shortcuts.  there are a lot of these positions to test,
and finding shortcuts isn't always easy.

this is all discussed in my message "new upper bounds" of jan 7 1995.
