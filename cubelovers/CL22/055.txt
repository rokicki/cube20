Subject: Rubik's Magic

	Peter Beck says one can make these with any number of panels which is
a multiple of four.  Actual any even number is possible.  I have several
example of  2 x 3.  Actually, there are two examples - the third is the
one with six hexagons.
	Both the  2 x 3 examples were promotional items for magazines, one
in Italy and one in France.  I happened to be in France when the French 
example was attached to a magazine called Super in Jun 1988.  I bought about
a dozen example, but I have no spares left!
	The  2 x 2  was marketed in four forms and one could assemble all
four into a bigger pattern.  However, I've also got three Hungarian versions.
One has religious symbols and comes in a folder with a picture of the Pope
on the front, apparently commemorating the Pope's visit to Hungary or
Austria.
