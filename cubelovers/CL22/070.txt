Let's say the cube-lovers of the world are skeptical...

Are we talking about q turns or q+h turns?
My own conjecture (which I have kept to myself until now) was that Mike Reid's
12-flip pattern in 24 q turns was the antipode in q turns only. I have no
proof of this fact.
 
It is possible Professor Korf has found a totally new approach to the rubik
problem. Dik Winter (months and months before) never did find any position on
the 3x3x3  which required more than 20 moves in the q+h metric. 
 
Conventional wisdom (using Kociemba type algorithms) was that the god's algorithm
for the standard 3x3x3 cube was intractible.
 
In case case, without more evidence, this news message does not add to the
existing level of cube knowledge. 
 
I'm still waiting and watching for any optimal solutions to the Megaminx 
spot patterns!
 
Perhaps Professor Korf has a mathematical proof. It does seem unlikely that he
sifted through all the possible positions.
