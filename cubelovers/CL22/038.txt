 Here's one list recipient who thinks Christoph Bandelow was quite
courteous in his "propaganda"; I was quite glad to finally have a
convenient way to request his catalog. I hope he's not overwhelmed by
requests! As some (perhaps most) of you know, he has quite a reputation
(and a good one) already.

 Christoph: It's fine with me! Next message (private) will be a
catalog request to you. Welcome to the 'Net!
