	Congratulations! I remember going through this about 8
years ago, when I got my 5X5. My approach for the 3X3 was to 
solve the corners, then the middle edges; so those techniques carried 
over without a change. The rest was simpler, as far as I recall. Trouble 
was, even knowing the finished procedure, it took about an hour each 
time.
