This is right.

Not really.  Rich's heuristic functions are (precomputed) distances 
along some coordinates of a multidimensional space.  His best apparently
are the corner positions and twice one half of the edge positions.
Similarly in both phases of Herbert's algorithm similar heuristic
functions (pruning tables, filters, ...) are used.

Of course the choice of heuristic function plays an essential role.
For instance, Herbert's original algorithm uses in the first phases
three heuristic functions all three based on a single coordinate
in a three dimensional space.  I modified it to use three heuristic
functions based on two dimensional coordinate planes in that same
space.  Depending on the problem to solve, this may be better or not,
in this case it is (much) better.  A similar modification did I do
in the second phase.

As far as the first is concerned, I think so too.  When Herbert's
algorithm is run through to the end it will find an optimal solution
indeed, and in the search for that optimal solution it will use a
new heuristic function for the total solution: the result of previous
suboptimal solutions that come in pretty fast, which is used to prune
the second phase rigorously.  I have been able to proof (with my
modification of Herbert's algorithm) some pretty large (18-20 turn)
solutions optimal.  I do not think Rich's algorithm will be able to do
that in reasonable time.

No, this is right indeed.

Something I did estimate already a long time ago.  I have done a few
hundred random cubes (a few thousand?  I do no longer remember) back
so many years ago.  As I remember, I let the program look for optimal
solutions upto 18f (longer is a bit time consuming).  As I remember,
there were only very few that could *not* be solved in 18f.  There must
be a discussion about this in the archives.
