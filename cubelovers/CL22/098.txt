The method I suggested for reusing tables for new heuristics should be
applicable to any group-theoretic puzzle for which there are
symmetries mapping generators to generators.  For instance, the N^2-1
puzzles have the 8-fold symmetry D4, and so could have one set of
tables used for 16 heuristics.

Given the central nature the memory-performance tradeoff plays in the
paper, I imagine this is quite relevant to Rich's research.

Of course, I also discussed a number of other topics in that message,
but I don't think they were the ones you were addressing in your remarks.
