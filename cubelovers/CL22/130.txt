Actually, the corners of the 3x3x3 are not usually considered to be
equivalent to the 2x2x2.  There are 24 times fewer states in the 2x2x2
because any of the 24 rotations in space of the 2x2x2 are considered to be
equivalent.  Another way (and the typical computer way) to model this
effect is to fix one of the corners of the 2x2x2.

Your logic is correct.  The larger size of 264,539,520 is the number of
corner configurations in the so-called constructable group.  The
constraint on the twist of the last corner cubie gets you down to
88179840, and is the only other constraint on the corners alone.  When you
add in the edge cubies, there are two additional constraints  --  one for
the edge cubies alone, and one for the corner and edge cubies combined
(they have to have the same parity).
