The fact that 10% of Rich Korf's random sample was 16f from Start seemed a
little funny, so I did some calculations.  At most, about 2.9% of the
positions in G are 16f from Start.  I am sure that the problem is no more
than that the sample size is very small.
 
Here is the calculation of the 2.9% figure.  The following table gives the
best known results for face turns.  The results through depth 7 have been
calculated (my message of 19 July 1994).  The rest are based on Dan Hoey's
recursion formula PH[n] = 6*2*PH[n-1] + 9*2*PH[n-2] for n>2, where PH[n]
is the number of face turns which are n moves from Start (Dan's note of 16
Sep 1981).  I think it would have been ok to use a branching factor of
13.231 from depth 8 on, but just to be safe I used Dan's formula (the
results are essentially the same either way).  Hence, we have PH[16] <=
1.47E+18, which is just about 2.9% of |G|.

 18  2.42E+20 13.348  2.61E+20

Now, I am going to do something strange.  I am going to assume as per
Rich's results that the branching factor from 16f to 17f is 3, and from
17f to 18f is 2 (Rich found 1 position at 16f, 3 at 17f, and 6 at 18f).
Doing so yields the following unhappy result (the total positions are less
than |G| which is about 4.3E+19).

 17  4.07E+18  3.000  5.54E+18
 18  8.14E+18  2.000  1.37E+19

If we assume the 16f position was an accident (occurred more than three
times too often, which is not surprising with the small sample size), we
can suppose the branching factor does not break until going from 17f to
18f, and we get the following. 
				        	
 17  1.81E+19 13.348  1.96E+19
 18  3.62E+19  2.000  4.23E+20

It's just totally a wild guess, but I would suspect that the correct
numbers are closer to the following because I don't think the branching
factor will collapse all at one depth.

 17  6.79E+18  5.000  8.25E+18
 18  3.39E+19  5.000  4.22E+19

I am a little shy of |G| with this guess, but I am not too far off.  What
we need is a larger sample.
