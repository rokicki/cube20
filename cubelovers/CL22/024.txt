Shouldn't the program be smart enough to answer that question for you?  :-)

It would obviously be of interest in Cubism For Fun, the journal of the
Dutch Cube Society (which has been published in English for about the past
10 years or so).  I don't think you'd get paid for it, but the audience
would be right.

I would guess that Scientific American, Journal of Recreational Mathematics,
and Games might also be suitable, depending on possible characteristics of
the program.
