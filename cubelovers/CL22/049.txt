Subject: Extra-long Rubik's magic rings
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I just ran across a store selling a double long rubik's magic rings (the
flat folding puzzle) that instead 2x4 squares with three rings was 2x8 (I
think)with about six rings.  They were made by matchbox in 1987.  I would
have purchased one, but the price seemed like it might be steep.  Does
anyone know if these are common or can be found elsewhere? Or should I rush
back and buy one before they disappear?  Please let me know.
