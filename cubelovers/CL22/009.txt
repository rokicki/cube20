There are four Rubik's Tangles. Each of them
has 25 pieces and forms a 5x5 square. Once you've
got all four you can mix all of the pieces up and produce
a giant 10x10.

I don't know if Dr Bruhns solution on his page 
<http://www.math.uni-kiel.de/roesler/bruhn/tlsg.htm>
is correct - once I get to print it out in colour at the
office I'll see if it matches the tangle I have (# 4).
