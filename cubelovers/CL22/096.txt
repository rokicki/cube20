Subject: new search heuristics


I wonder about the local "shape" of the distance heuristics accuracy.  How inaccurate are
they typically, and how inaccurate can the worst cases be?  Is it typically the case
that all the estimates for nearby positions are similar, or are there outliers?
Are the good and bad guesses uniformly distributed, or are they clustered? Depending
on the shape of the space, I can imagine strategies specifically designed to improve,
by looking a little harder for a good estimate.

Are there useable heuristics which are guaranteed to overestimate
distance?  If so, then they could be used in concert with positions
known to be distant from solved to improve the bounds for A*.  For example,
with an overestimating heuristic (n) for a position known to be more than 18
moves from start, we could use 18-n as an independant underestimate of distance
from start.
