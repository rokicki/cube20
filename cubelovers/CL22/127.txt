Subject: Number of States for 2x2x2 cube

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Reading about the number of possible states (88million) for the corners
  of the 3x3x3 cube (equiv. to 2x2x2) made me try working this out for
  myself. My logic was :

  Cube has 8 corners, each of which can have 3 orientations. Number of
  possible states is

  (8*3)*(7*3)*(6*3)*(5*3)*(4*3)*(3*3)*(2*3)*(1*3) = 8!*3**8 = 264,539,520

  This figure of course includes some states only possible by disassembling
  the cube (or maybe by twisting it in a fourth dimension ?). Without this
  the last corner can only have one orientation so the number of states
  achievable by twisting only in 3d is 8!*3**7 = 88179840

  I assume that this is the correct figure but what I would like to know is
  whether my logic is correct ie is the assumption about the last corner
  being fixed in orientation the only requirement (I am not a mathematician
  so please excuse me if this is obvious).
