If I interpret this correctly, what you have at this point is a
Thistlethwaite algorithm with G -> <U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2> -> I, proving that
any position can be solved in no more than 30f moves.  Is this the correct
interpretation?  But more importantly, is there anything in the part of
your algorithm where you combine stage1 and stage2 which would establish
an upper bound which is less than 30f?
