Ditto congrats.

As far as solving, I find it useful (from a "finger-exercise" point of
view) to give myself "stunt" solutions to work towards.  For instance with
the 5X, I like to start with a single center face (say, blue).  Then I
solve the remaining "ring" of inner blue faces in order.  Then the ring of
blue edge and corner pieces (again, in circluar order).  Then each
successively higher "horizontal" slice (again, in order around the cube)...
and so on until the cube is finished.

Needless to say, some backup is occassionally necessary.  But this can be
a pleasant way to pass the time.
