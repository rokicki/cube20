It's like you supposed. I see no way, how to *guarantee* an optimal
solution before that, though in many cases you *find* an optimal
solution much earlier. You may have more than one minimum maneuver, and
the chance is good, that one of these maneuvers has a tail with
maneuvers only out of <U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2>.
