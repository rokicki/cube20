I have one of these that I bought when they originally came out.  I
wouldn't really call it a "level 2" puzzle, as the mechanics are identical
to that of the original Rubik's Magic.  The goal is different, however.
Each plate is divided into different coloured quarters.  The object is to
get both the proper shape - a cube resting on one of it's edges, centred
atop a "platform" of the two other plates - and the proper colour
orientation - the three faces that join in each corner of the cube must
have identical colours in the quadrant at that corner.
