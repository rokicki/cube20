I must point out at this point that the magic's stringing pattern actually
revovles around just two patterns, which are equivalent to each other in
some positions.

These patterns actually only require three tiles. Three tiles will not make
a circuit, but they will make a nice line or L-shape. 

For a bit of real(?) excitment(??) you could try to make one out of just two
panels. This is highly possible, as I did it back when I was 12 or 13 in
Senior school. The secret is that you loop one of the "Ligaments" as I used
to call them back around one panel twice. I cannot remember whether or not
this could go around for ever or whether it had a definiate start and end
point, but it certainly confused my classmates.

I also know that it is possible to add just two panels onto an ordinary
Rubik's Magic, creating a 2x5 array, which I don't have to say, is not
exactly divisible by four. This was fully functional, but when it was folded
in half, it did not go into "Loop" or "Tie Fighter", it went into "Fish"
from either side, unless the last two squares were folded in before folding
along the centre line. I called this the "Diabolical Edition" because it was
harder than the Master Edition, and I made about four of them for members of
my old school (Blue Coat, Liverpool).

loop:
!--!

tie fighter:

Fish:

I also created a "master Edition" from Two ordinary magics when someone drew
freehand the "Sandwich Filler" pieces of paper. 

But my Piece de Resistance is the 64-panelled monstrousity that used to take
me an hour to solve, and was a complete work-out as there was so much
to-and-fro ing of the entire magic. I had to use the pictures from 12
magics, and is just an extension of the master editions solution. When it is
in a 32x2 state, it was higher than my (then) best friend, and you require
quite substantial floor space to solve it.
