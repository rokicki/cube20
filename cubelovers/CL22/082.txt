No, you've misunderstood.  Rich doesn't attempt to "map all possible
iterations" (by which you seem to imply some sort of preprocessing so
as to be able to recognize any position at a given depth).  After all,
according to his estimate of the median, there should be over 10^18 of
them at depth 18f, and finding them all would take his program many
thousands of years.

Instead, he takes advantage of knowing what the target cube is by
using a measure called a "heuristic".  A heuristic estimates how far a
given process is from solving the cube, such as the "oriented distance
from home" (ODH) that appears in the archives.  Then if you have tried
7f turns and you know it will take at least 12f more, you know you're
on the wrong track, and look elsewhere.

But there are lots and lots of wrong tracks, and you need to recognize
and discard them quickly.  The ODH isn't that good an estimate, so it
doesn't discard enough of them--it would still take 250 years to
search for one position.  Finding better ways of estimating how far
you are from the goal is what the research is about.

So just because he says it's "brute force" doesn't mean you list all
the positions in advance.  You definitely need to know what the goal
position is for Rich's approach to work.  In particular, his method
does not seem to be applicable to finding what the furthest position
is.
