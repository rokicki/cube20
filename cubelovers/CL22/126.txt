Corners first, middle edges interconnecting edges, and finally centers.
<U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2> that is read as Up turn, Down turn, Left turn twice,
Front turn twice, Back turn twice.  It's standard notation referring to
the faces of a cube, assuming you're using one face as a reference
point.  The notation typically uses 90 degree clockwise turns.
