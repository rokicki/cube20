While it's certainly possible that the news release may have distorted the
original message, I certainly would not in any way discount the work of
Dr. Korf as he is a recognized authority in the area of computer search
(you'll find his name within the index of any decent book on the subject).

As far as I know he is also the first, and only, person to have developed
a computer program capable of discovering a general solution to the cube
starting only from basic knowledge of cube states and operators.

Forgive me for keeping an open mind on this one.
