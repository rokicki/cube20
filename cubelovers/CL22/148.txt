	The orange sticker problem seems to be with all of them.  Mine had
some small documentation with it mentioning that putting a piece of paper
on the orange side and ironing it a bit will help fix the stickers on the
cube.  It worked well for me and I've not had any problems with them
anymore.
	As to keeping it in one piece, pop off the caps of the center
pieces and tighten the screws underneath.  Adjust this tension to tight and
your cube won't move well, too loose and it will fall apart.  I had trouble
getting the caps off one of my 5x5x5s, but on the other they often fall off
on their own, good luck.
