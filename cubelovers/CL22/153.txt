>From Peter Reitan, not karen Angelli

Joe McGarity has had some trouble with the structural integrity of his
5x5x5 cube (is there a more poetic name out there, in the same vein as
rubik's pocket, rubik's cube or rubik's revenge? 5x5x5 seems cumbersome to
me.  If not, let me suggest the "Big Cube").  I have had similar problems,
but I have managed to get past them, and can now freely twist my cube (at
least so far).

I bought my "Big Cube" from Puzzletts' on-line puzzle store.  I think that
their supplier is from Germany.  You can also purchase them directly from
Christoph Bandelow in Germany.  Like Joe's, my cube had several initial
problems - some of the orange stickers, paradoxically, did not want to
stick, and three of the center-piece caps fell off.  After several moments
of panic, I ran to my super glue supplier and took a few hits (no, I did
not sniff it).  Since then, the orange stickers have lived up to their
name, and the center-piece caps have stayed in place.  

I hope that these suggestions can get you on the right track.

'e-ya later,
Pete
