 I've had the same luck, but I thought it was lubricant that had migrated;
I'm reasonably sure I tried lubricating my "5". Lubricant could turn
adhesive into a gel, I think. 

 Why the orange ones only? I think the reason is that they are a different
pigment (mine's fluorescent, pretty sure!) on a different backing, perhaps
plastic, while the others might be a high-quality paper; the plastic might
require a different kind of adhesive.  (Then, again, maybe when the maker
shopped around for sheets of colored adhesive sheet stock, what was
available at a a good price might not have included orange...) 

 It's just possible that the molding compound included a few percent
lubricant, and that interacted with the adhesive to create a gel. Consider
what happens to the adhesive on masking tape when you apply it to
plasticized PVC (vinyl) and leave it there for a few weeks or longer. The
plasticizer (which, I understand, is a actually low-vapor-pressure
solvent)  migrates into the adhesive. Migration of plasticizer is a
problem with plasticized PVC. (Any flexible vinyl is plasticized; rigid
vinyl is quite stiff!))
