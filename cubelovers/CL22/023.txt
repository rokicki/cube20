I will mail you the piece as promptly as possible.  I recently moved
into a new residence days ago, so you will have to bear with me as I
hunt for my puzzle box and hope that I didn't throw away my ravaged cube
in a fit of....confusion?

You want to hear the ugly truth?  Ugh...  Ok..  while thumbing through
Dr. Christoph Bandelow's excellent cube catalog (1992 edition, I think),
I stumbled upon an object called the "Fisher Cube," in which each
handmade cube had a unique "cut" to it.  Basically on a standard cube
the "groove" lines run parallel to the faces of the cube.  On fisher's
cube, two opposite faces had the groove lines running diagonally, which
meant that a scrambled cube looked absolutely jacked up.  I got this
brilliant idea that I could make something similar, so out came the
hacksaw....  After about an hour and a half of cutting I realized that I
had completely ruined a perfectly good cube.  And my bedroom floor (and
desk, and bed, and lamp, and clothes, etc....) was COVERED in black
plastic shavings which, despite their strangely appealing odor, had
managed to make a terrible mess.  So after giving myself disgusted looks
into a mirror (as a form of "self scolding," if you will) I packed all
the pieces away, thinking that maybe someday I would take the Time to
reassemble it or fix it somehow.  After acquiring 4 more cubes over a
period of 5 years, I have lost interest in that project.  

Soooo, that's it.  Nothing particularly drastic, but I think it might be
worth a chuckle or two to those of the mailing list, so what started as
a personal email has become my own public shame.  So I also hope you
won't have a problem with your "private email" being part of this drawn
out response.

P.S. If I find it, you want the whole mess or just the middle?
