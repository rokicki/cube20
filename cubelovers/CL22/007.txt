For those having trouble with

my Portuguese is unreliable, but here is a first cut at a translation:

Magic Cube

The famous magic cube is here in 3D for [desafia]ing.  You can turn
the cube freely (by) dragging with the mouse.  To turn the faces, drag
with the mouse _on the vertices_.  To play: click the [seta] of the
mouse over the cube and type m to mess up all the faces.  With the
[seta] of the mouse over the cube, type i to reinitialize.

(Or you may see:

Your Netscape isn't understanding Java applets!  [Atualize] for a more
recent version.)

Game created by Marcelo Ribeiro.

[I have to confess that I don't understand the heuristic by which it
decides which face to turn.  I actually tried to solve the thing and
it gave me the screaming meemies.]
