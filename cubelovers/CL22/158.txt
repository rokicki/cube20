 Peter (Reitan, I think; sorry) (who is not Karen) brought up the
clumsiness of such designations as "5X5X5". I find these downright clumsy
to type (although the Caps Lock key helps). In my private world, I simply
refer to the Pocket Cube as "[the] two", the original Rubik's as "[the]
three", Revenge as "[the] four", and the biggest available as "[the]
five". 

 I think that provided we understand that we are referring to the
well-known family of true cubes, it should be OK simply to refer to "the
three", for instance. Granted, these names require more keystrokes, but
numerals should be OK, as in "the 3".

 There is some risk of being obscure; I feel that there are ways to deal
with that. We don't seem to have oodles of newcomers to the List every
day, who would need to be directed to FAQ.

 By any chance, is there more info. about a 6 or a 7? I last heard that a
prototype 6 had been built; I'd really love to know what the mechanism is
like. (I wrote about this at some length, a good number of months ago.)

My best regards,
