Obviously, any conjugate of <U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2> would do as well as any
other.  Have you looked for conjugate positions in your table?  For
example, you might have a position x which is 10 moves from
<U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2>, but position y which is a conjugate of x might be only
be 9 moves from <U,D,R2,L2,F2,B2>.  In this case, you might as well solve
y, knowing that the number of moves to solve x is the same as the number
of moves to solve y, and knowing that the solutions are conjugate.  Also,
by subjecting your entire table to this kind of analysis (if you haven't
already), you might find an upper bound for stage1 which is less than 12f.
