	I got an email from a list member
indicating that he would like to try my Java cubes and
polyhedra but has no suitable Internet access.

	If anyone else is in this position, I could email
the Java class files directly to them, and they could use them by
installing Sun's free Java Development Kit on their machine.
It's available for a few operating systems. Of course, without
Internet access, this begs the question of how you would get the 
JDK in the first place.
