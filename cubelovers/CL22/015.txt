Subject: Broken Cube

I've got a problem.  My cube (3x3x3) is quite old and very used.
Unfortunately, I was using it the other day and the whole thing fell apart
in my hands - the center cross piece that holds the whole thing together
split in two.  I'm afraid all my attempts with gluing it back together have
failed.  Does anyone know where I can get just the center piece?
