The game has already been described, so I won't do it again.  But I will
make a couple of comments.

The Windows version of the game has a certain charm that does not exist
when you play it with real cards.  The rules require that you move one
card at a time.  In actual practice you often move a group of cards as
if they were a single entity, knowing full well that you could move them
one at a time and still stay within the rules of the game.  The Windows
version of the game understands this concept, and will move an entire
group of cards for you with one mouse click.  It's almost as if the
program is defining a macro operator for you on the fly.  Also, there
are totally obvious moves, such as always playing aces to their payoff
cells without further ado as soon as the aces are uncovered.  The
program plays these totally obvious moves for you. At the end of the
game there may be several dozen such obvious moves in a row, and it
makes a nice visual effect that you cannot get with real cards.  (By the
way, the program fails to make some moves which are totally obvious (to
me, at least), but any discussion of such things should probably be
taken off line.  I am curious if our moderator is going to let through
such an off topic message, anyway.)

But by contrast, my personal experience is that graphics cube
manipulation programs have less charm than the real thing.  There is
just something nice about the feel of the thing in your hands, and in
its obvious 3-D solidness.
