Try Peter Beck of New Jersey.  I don't remember his address (my address
book program was lost along with EVERYTHING else in a hard drive crash)
but I've seen his name on a list or two of puzzle sources.  The last
Time I bought puzzles from him (ohh... about 3 years ago) he had ONE
used Impossiball available.  But who knows, maybe things have improved
since then.

Speaking of which, does anyone know where I can get my hands on a
Rubik's Revenge?  I saw some for sale at www.puzzlett.com, but someone
said that they were an unreliable source (i.e. they ripped him off).
