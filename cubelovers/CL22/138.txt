Does anyone know more about the following method?

	1. do top corners. I always start with white. (intuitive)
	2. do bottom corners.
	        2a. bring bottom corner color onto bottom face (one of 2
patterns)
	        2b. orient bottom corners with each other (one of 2
patterns)
	3. fill in all but one edge on top and bottom (intuitive)
	4. fill in last edge (pattern)
	5. solve middle ring of edges (usually 2 patterns)

I received it from someone off the mailing list but they didn't know
where I could find more info on this pattern.  If anyone can point me to
a url that would be helpful, or just explain it directly to me.

Josh
