I do not think there are really statistics.  But I have done a complete
analysis on similar puzzles (domino, 2x2x2) where the number of positions
from start increases roughly by the factor you would expect if you
eliminate elementary duplicates as you listed.  This both for face
turns and quarter turns.  This increase goes on until shortly before
the maximum of turns when the number of new configurations drops
dramatically.  I think the figures are in the archives.  I have no
reason to expect the case to be different for the cube, rather all my
experiments lead me to predict that the same is the case with the cube.

None, except that the diameter of the group will be larger.  (But not
much larger.)  And that makes it in Rich's algorithm only computationally
more expensive.

The last is almost certainly not true.  In the archives there must be an
article by Michael Reid where he made an attempt to generalize Kociemba's
algorithm.  I.e. find a subgroup of the total group, phase 1 is to
find a path to that subgroup and phase 2 is to find a path to the
solution.  I disremember the entire contents, but as far as I remember
the optimal partitions all used a subgroup which needed only half turns
for at least one face pair.  Looking for quarter turn optimization is
not really feasable with such a partition.
