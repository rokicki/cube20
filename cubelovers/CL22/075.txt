._@_.What do the skeptics have to say about the 20 move solve?  It was said

._@_.

There was a prove that within 16-18 face move, the number of possible
pattern exceed the number of possible pattern of the cube,
hence they deduce that any pattern can be acheive within 16-18 move,
ie: it can be done, 

if u can move forward 18 move, 
by backtracking, it can be move backward within 18 move.


._@_.Does anyone know how long time wise it took Richard Korf to solve it

._@_.I'm just a 15 year old who can solve the cube so I don't know much about
._@_.theories or mathematical patterns.  So if someone can explain it to me
._@_.that would be great.

._@_.If it all that is claims to be, then I can't wait to know how to use the
._@_.method. 

I don't think "the method",(if it actually exist,) can be applied to human,
i think it involved a lot of AI research, where computer will think
faster and can plan say 5 to 6 move ahead, and see if it recognise any pattern


I will not put much hope on trying to solve in 20 move 
with a real cube by hand.
