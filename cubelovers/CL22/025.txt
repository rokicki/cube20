I finally got around to building a bandaged pair of cubes

and a bandaged 5-cube

I agree--the process was very painful and very full of black shavings, 
but now that I am done, I am very pleased with the final result. :-)

The impetus for this fit of cube-construction came from the book "The 
book of ingenious & diabolical puzzles" by Jerry Slocum and Jack Botermans.

Also resulting from the same fit are a round cube with what look like two 
2x2x2's sticking out of it, and a regular cube in which two opposite 
corners and all the adjacent pieces are round.

All of these came after taking a good look at pages 124 and 125 of this 
book--a page full of a very interesting collection of sequential movement 
puzzles.  Thie is a really neat book that will make any collector drool, 
so keep your eyes out for it :-)
