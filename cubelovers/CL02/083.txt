   Does anyone know good move sequences for exchanging a pair or corner
cubies on a face without twisting?  (Of course, a pair of edges will have
to exchange also.)  Or of cycling 3 corners without twisting?  I'm looking
for the "shortest" sequence, and the "easiest to remember" sequence.
Most of the moves I've seen are long and complicated.
