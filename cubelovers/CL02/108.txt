cube-lovers-request@mit-mc is the mailing list to send adminitrivia
to.  Since mailing to cube-lovers causes machines all over the ARPA
net to have to deal with the mail, you should all take a moment to
remember that fact, so that when YOU want to be removed, or want
someone new added, you will know who to mail to.
