   While it shouldn't be TOO hard to program an arbitrarily-fine
simulation of a Rubik sphere, one wonders how it's colored.
do the latitute/longitude coordinates on the sphere correspond
to hue/intensity?  While you can settle for any coordinate 
labelling of points, different coloring schemes will dictate
what constitutes a "pretty" pattern, yes?
