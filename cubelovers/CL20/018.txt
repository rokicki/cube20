One solution to this dilemma is to let some of the "cubies" become
"brickies" (i.e., rectangular bricks instead of cubes).  In this approach,
there's no limit in principle on N to how large an NxNxN puzzle you could
build with the standard mechanism.  There is, of course, the lower limit 
you just described to how small the corner cubies could become.
