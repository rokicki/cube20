I would not necessarily agree with the assertion that if one can solve 
an N^3 cube, one can solve an (N-1)^3 cube.

Your construction, of solving the N^3 cube into a subgroup that is 
homeomorphic to the (N-1)^3 cube, assumes that one already knows how to 
solve a (N-1)^3 cube.

True, and I will conceed that if you know how to solve a 3x3x3, you can 
solve a 2x2x2.

Yes, the 3x3x3 groups are proper subgroups (or, probably more 
accurately, homeomorphic to proper subgroups) of the 4x4x4 groups, but 
that doesn't mean that knowing how to solve the 4x4x4 allows one to 
solve the 3x3x3.

For instance, I can solve a 4x4x4.  However, my solution to the 4x4x4 
involves slice moves that don't exist on a 3x3x3 cube, through all 
stages of my solution, including the final stage.  I cannot directly 
apply my 4x4x4 solution to a 3x3x3 cube.  (I can to the 2x2x2 cube, 
since the techniques for solving the corners are applicable to cubes of 
all order N).  If my solution for solving the 4x4x4 involved reducing 
it to the subgroup of the 4x4x4 generated by face turns only, then yes, 
I could directly solve a 3x3x3 by the methods I use for a 4x4x4, but I 
don't.

The question originally asked (by Aaron Wong) was "Is there an ULTIMATE 
Rubik's cube that, if an algorithm for it was known, it would contain 
an algorthm for ANY Rubik's cube?"

There might be no answer to the general question of if -any- algorithm 
was known for the U^3 cube, than an algorithm could be derived for any 
N^3 cube.  For instance, few here would argue the assertion that if you 
can solve a 3x3x3, you can solve a 2x2x2, but from the discriptions 
I've heard of it, I wonder how well Thistlewaite's algorithm would work 
on a 2x2x2 cube.

A Thistlewaite type algorithm for a (2N)^3 cube might very well reduce 
the (2N)^3 cube to the subgroup that is equivilant to a 2^3 cube in its 
final stages.  Such an algorithm would be totally unsuited for solving 
a (2M+1)^3 cube, because there would be no way to reduce that to a 2^3 
cube.  (In general, I would guess that any algorithm for an n^3 cube 
that involved reducing it to an m^3 cube, where n = km, would be 
unsuited for solving a l^3 cube, where l does not have n or m as a 
factor).

However, I think the question can be divided into two parts, if we look 
at it differently (requiring the existance of an algorithm with the 
stated property for order U^3 cubes, rather than requiring that all 
algorithms for order U^3) cubes have the stated property):  First, is 
there a general algorithm that can be used to solve cubes of all 
orders?  I think the answer is "yes".  Second, what is the smallest 
order U^3 cube requiring a complete description of the algorithm?  I 
think the answer is U=5.

My current solution for the 4^3 cube is very closely related to my current solution for the 3^3.  There are only minor changes in one stage, major changes in another, (both to deal with the split edge pieces) and the addition of a completely new stage to handle the centers, which aren't in the 3^3 at all.  Transforming this algorithm to the 5^5 and higher is relatively easy, once I have the 3^3 and 4^4 down.  All the important components of the two lower order solutions are needed for the 5^5, and nothing really new is added.  The same goes for the higher orders.  The tedium of solving increases, but not the real difficulty.

I have been thinking (but haven't done much yet) of writing a collection of web pages describing my general solution (at least, for the 2^3, 3^3, and 4^4 cubes).
