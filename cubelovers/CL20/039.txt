I was in the contests.  First place in Peoria, IL with 48 seconds or so.
Then I won 5th place in Chicago with 47ish seconds, 3rd in St. Louis
with 46 seconds.  I was only 13 at the time and it was just a thrill to
be there with so many other avid cube-solvers.  I still have my official
Ideal "Cubists Do It Faster" T-shirts.  From the St. Louis contest,
which was held in a large outdoor mall, I managed to come away with
one of the stage props which was a giant cardboard cube about 3 feet
per side.  I used it as a table for a few years, then it finally
collapsed.
