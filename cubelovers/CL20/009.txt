Speaking of oversized Rubik puzzles...

A good friend of mine built an oversized, fully functional Rubik's Magic about
3 years ago.  She painted all of the artwork that went inbetween the plastic
squares, cut out all the grooves, and used a heavy duty grade of fishing wire
to connect all the pieces.  We kind of thrashed my Rubik's Magic to see how
many wires were used in the Magic and all the paths they took.

I _think_ each square was 1'X1', so that would have made the puzzle 2'X4'.
 It's fun to play with, but only if you have the stamina; it's heavy!  :)
