Thanks for the references.  I haven't seen Eidswick's paper yet,
but will check it out.

I just did, and for the specific case that I describe (which is "s:
Supergroup, i: theoretical invisible group") the formulas are exactly
the same.  I didn't consider nearly the range of alternatives discussed
in that article, but its nevertheless nice to see a confirmation of
the results.
