On average, my algorithm requires about 60 moves. It has been optimized
for speed, not for the number of moves. Once I have little more time, I
may retype all the necessary algorithms into an electronic form and post
them here. I published the algorithms in 1982 in Mlady Svet
(a Czech magazine). But this will probably not help you too much :-(
