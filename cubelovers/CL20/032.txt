To have a bit more challange when doing the cube, complete it so that each 
horizontal slice, is 1 turn (quarter of a full circle) out of place.
Therefore, top and bottom face are one colour, but all side faces contain 3
colours.
Boy, is it hard!

By the way, I can do the cube in 1 minute 26 seconds.
How does that compare with everyone else!
(P.S. Please be fair, I`ve only been doing it for 6 weeks or so!)
