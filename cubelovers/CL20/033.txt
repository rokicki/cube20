   Hi all
   I'm looking for an easy to implementation / easy to debug / easy to print 
   / and most important chip to manipulate (in computer time) for the 3X3X3 
   cube. Does anyone heard of somthing?

Ani lo y'khol lavin et-ha-anglit shelkha.  Are you looking for a
program?  An algorithm?  A piece of hardware?  A circuit diagram?  And
I apologize in advance if I got your gender wrong in my wretched
Hebrew.
