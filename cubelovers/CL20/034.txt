37.72 won me the midwest championship, my best official time was
35.30 seconds which placed me 5th in the country. I think it was 1981.
Now?  I don't get timed very often, but it's still usually under a minute.

I guess it is like riding a bicycle.

Anyone else on this list from those contest days?  Minh Thai - are you
out there?  How about Jeff Verasono? or David P. Conrady?  I've often
wondered what that crazy guy with the bright maroon hair ended up
doing with his life...
