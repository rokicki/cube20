So, I was recently given a cube, which once again sparked my interest in 
the whole thing, however it appears that the stickers have been pulled 
off and re-arranged at some point.  (The faces don't match any I've seen 
mentioned in the archives or the various web pages.)

What would be the right way to put it back together to get a "working" cube?
