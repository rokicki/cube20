My name is Jiri Fridrich and I am the champon of Czechoslovakia from 1982.
I won the championship with time 23.55. When I was at my best, I was able
to solve the cube in 17 seconds on average (average from 10 consecutive
runs). Even today, after all those years, I can solve the cube in 20
seconds on average. I am using about 150 different algorithms and need 60
moves on average. 

Just for the record: The 1983 champion of Czechoslovakia, Robert Pergl,
won with 17.04. There must be *many* guys out there who can solve the cube
consistently below 20 sec :-)
