In my opinion mechanical designs for the 7 and above will have to be
fundamentally different from those for the 6 and below, because that's
the point at which the "buried" corner of a corner cubie extends past
the surface of the face during a face turn and thus it's not possible
to build the thing as rigid pieces connected to a central mechanism, at
least not without cutting away part of some face-center cubies.
(Specifically, that buried corner is at sqrt(2)*(.5-1/N) from the
center, taking the cube side as 1 and N as the order of the cube.  The
face is at .5 from the center.  The former becomes greater than the
latter at about N=6.83...not that non-integer N make physical sense.)

This is not to say that a 7 is impossible, just that it will have to be
rather drastically different - somehow, when a turn is started, the
corner cubie will have to be mechnically locked to the rest of the face
that's turning with it.  I can easily enough imagine possible
mechanisms, but coming up with one simple enough to mass-produce at a
price people are likely to be willing to pay would be a major
challenge.

On the other hand, a straightforward locking mechanism could probably
be put together by a good watchmaking shop at no more than the price of
a high-end watch.  A few collectors might go for it, especially since
the result - particularly if made out of metal - would feel much better
than the plastic-on-plastic feel of most cubes.
