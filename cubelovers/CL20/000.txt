Subject: cube solutions prior to 1980

Some time ago someone asked a question about early cube solutions.
Unfortunately I don't find the corresponding mail, but here is what I have
found.
I have solutions by the following people which were all written in 1979:
Angevine, Beasley, Cairns/Griffiths, Dauphin, Howlett, Jackson (3-D),
Johnson, Maddison, Singmaster, Sweenen and Truran.
At http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Georges_Helm/cubbib.htm other
info on solutions can be found.
