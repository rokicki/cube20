Subject: ULTIMATE Rubik's cube?

I'm not sure if this has been discussed or not, but I was asked the following
question, and I am not sure of thie answer.

Is there an ULTIMATE Rubik's cube that, if an algorithm for it was known, it
would contain an algorthm for ANY Rubik's cube?

I guessed that it was four, but I'm not so sure about it.
