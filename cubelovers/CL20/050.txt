  Whenever I see posts like this I have to wonder what methods you guys are
using to solve the cube.  My average casual speed is about 80 seconds and when
I get in blitz mode I usually can average below a minute.  But, I never 
get below say 45 seconds unless I get a really nice starting position and
things just fall into place.  My personal best ever is about 32 seconds, back
when I was in high school.  

  Anyways, I am curious what methods people use.  I've asked around and it 
seems
most people prefer to go top/middle/bottom.  In fact, all the published 
solutions go that way.  But, I learned to go top/bottom/middle because it is 
MUCH easier.  At the same time, I've seen that when solving a single face, 
most solutions suggest doing edge and the corner pieces, but I do corner and 
then edge.  I think this has to do with whether you do the middle or the bottom
next because with the middle/bottom approach you can leave out one corner
piece to do the middle.  But if you do bottom/middle then you can leave out
an edge piece to aid in getting the buttom edge pieces done.


  Here is a quick overview of my solution (because it is different than most
peoples):

  1. do the top face.  4 corners then any 3 edges.  (intuitive)
  2. align bottom corner pieces.  (pattern)
  3. rotate bottom corner pieces so the correct color is showing (pattern)
  4. place the remaining 4 bottom edges and the missing top edge (intuitive)
  5. put the 4 middle edge pieces in the correct positions (intuitive)
  6. rotate edge pieces as needed (pattern)

  
  Anyways, is there one technique that almost all speedy solutions use?  I've
tried the top/middle/bottom solutions but they seem very uninuitive.  Do
most speed people only use patterns? (or at least after the top layer?)  How
many patterns do you use?  When I go for speed, I tend to use two patterns
for step 2, and 4 possible patterns for step 3.  Meaning that I use about
7 patterns max for speed and I use 3 patterns total when doing it casually.
