1 Minute 26!?!?!?!? That's very impressive. I can say that ONCE I got it down
to about 1 minute 10, but that was lucky. What order do you solve the pieces?
Top to Bottom? I'm trying to find the fastest possible method by combining
methods from other people.
=====================================================                                 

I solve top, bottom, middle, rotate.

Pretty quick.

Have tried top, middle bottom, but it is a little slower.

How about you, what metthod do you use
