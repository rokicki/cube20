I was the winner of the Massachusetts/New England region with a time
of 48.31 seconds.  I did have the distinction of being the youngest
winner however; I was only 9 years old and it was the summer of 1981.

Kristin, although Adam (my brother) and I did stay in touch with Jeff
Varasano for a few years, we eventually lost contact with him and
everyone else.  The best thing I remember about David Conrady was that
the day before the competition at That's Incredible, he dropped a
Rubik's Cube off of the 15th (or similar) floor and scared the heck
out of an old lady.  I had never seen a cube explode like that
before...
