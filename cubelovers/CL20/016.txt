As a first aside, I'd like to mention that a nice project was to get a
standard 3x3x3 cube into a standard American spaghetti sauce jar.  Makes
a good conversation piece, though hard to scramble quickly...

I feel compelled to mention that there's a small company in Taiwan which
makes two variants of the Hungarian Globe that are harder.  One variant
allows for a move that turns the 9 pieces on one side; the other variant
allows for the 5 pieces at every intersection to be rotated.

Let me dig out the address...
