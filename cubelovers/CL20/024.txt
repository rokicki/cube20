 Large corner cubies, and rectangular edge pieces to match, when seen 
face-on, right?

 Has anyone worked out the innards? Perhaps a further extension of the
scheme used for the 5^3? (If so, the retaining "foot" on a corner cubie
would have a truly wondrous shape! The "foot" of a 5^3 is quite
impressive.)

 I should have read this earlier; it might have saved bitspace from my 
mad electronic/mechanical scheme! :) It would also be quieter...

My best to all,
