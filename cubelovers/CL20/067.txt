I was in two different contests; one was at Six Flags Magic Mountain in
southern California, the other was at some mall in L.A.  I was never fast
enough to get to any of the finalist rounds, but it was fun all the same.

Minh Thai was at the contest at the mall; Ideal had him there to promote it.  I
happened to have a Revenge on me at the time, and he thought he'd demonstrate
to the crowd his solution for it.  He managed not to solve it, but rather
shatter it in about 10 seconds flat.  Not bad, eh?  :)
