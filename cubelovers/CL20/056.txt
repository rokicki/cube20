I'm sorry to bother all of you with this again but I have converted the 
document describing the model and implementation of a 4-dimensional 
(3x3x3x3) Rubik's Cube into a word processing document which I can 
transform into several formats, including MS Word 3.0 & 4.0 and RTF.

Anyone interested in a copy in word processing format let me know your 
interest and if you have a preferred format.  Unfortunately, a text only 
document will not be able to include any of the figures and as this does 
a grave injustice to the paper I would rather not ship text only copies.

Regards...
