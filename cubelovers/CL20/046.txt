I've teached a lot of people the cube, and after 6 weeks, that is a
really good time. I think it's much better than I did after that time.

To get *really* good times, you need a really good method, averaging
50-60 moves.

I won the swedish championship with 40.48 (*very* hard cubes), and ended
4th in the world championships with 24.57. My personal best is 15.92, and
best average of 10 consecutive solutions about 23.50. Nowadays I'm 2-4
seconds slower, but (fortunately!) I don't do it nearly as much.

Yes, its a lot like riding a bike. Sometimes I haven't done it for years,
get a new cube, and it's just like before. Weird...
