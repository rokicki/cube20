I've had this dream of making cubies which attach (via bars or perhaps
electromagnets) to their neighbors, with the smarts to detect the torque of
a turn and release until the turn has been completed.  You could then sell
corner cubies, edge cubies, face cubies, and internal cubies one-at-a-time
and people could build their own puzzles as large as they wanted.

I'll buy enough for an order 10 cube if anyone cares to make this.  :-)
