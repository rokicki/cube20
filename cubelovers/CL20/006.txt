I always thought that the Rubik's cube principle could only be applied to 
Polyhedrons of sides totalling 4, 6, 8, 12 or 20 as these are the only ones 
that could be made from only one shape of side.

If it is a 12 sided Rubik's polyhedron, there is one called the MegaMinx 
made by Uwe Meffret in Hong Kong. This should be available around the world 
as it is still in production.

Meffret's Company is known as:
IDI,
P.O.Box 24455,
Aberdeen,
Hong Kong.

(I haven't found anything on the Net for his Company, but I'd be interested 
to learn....)

 
Another possibility is that it could be a 'Cut down' Rubik Cube, but I 
haven't seen any of this type in years.
