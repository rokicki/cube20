Subject: Speed cubing


I've heard about some pretty fast people who've claimed to 
have averages in the low 20's, but I haven't seen them perform.

My buddy from high school, Scott Evans, now living in Austin,
averages about 25 seconds these days.  He's the fastest active
cubist I've seen in the last 10 years.  I'm at about 28 seconds.

Anyone else?
