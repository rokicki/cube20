  It probably isn't necessary for the legs to be so thin; the mechanical 
engineer probably had optimistic estimates of the likely forces and the 
strength of the particular polymer used. The latter isn't, by any means, 
cheap stuff.

 Wider legs might still meet the constraints that ensure the Cube not fall 
apart.

 (Sorry for a slow reply.)
