It's your zip code. The Post Office recognizes the zipcode with some sort of
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) then prints a barcode on the envelope
so that simpler machines can sort the mail later in its delivery path.
Sometimes the sender prints the barcodes (if your mail is part of a large
mailing, like junk mail, magazines, tax forms etc.).

The encoding is as follows:

  ||...  ...||  ..|.|  ..||.  .|..|  .|.|.  .||..  |...|  |..|.  |.|..
    0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9
