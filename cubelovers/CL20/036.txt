Actually, the distinction between G and G+C is that in the latter we
draw a distinction between cubes that differ by a whole-cube move as
different.

When we take account of the internal cubies I call it the "Theoretical
Invisible cube", described in my Invisible Revenge article 9 August
1982.  A solution method is given in 

	Eidswick, J. A., "Cubelike Puzzles -- What Are They
	and How Do You Solve Them?", 'American Mathematical
	Monthly', Vol. 93, #3, March 1986, pp. 157-176.

that is pretty much like yours, I think.

As for counting the positions, I haven't got around to checking the
numbers in "Groups of the larger cubes", 24 Jun 1987.  You might want
to see how they compare to yours.
