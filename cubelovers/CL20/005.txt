Me too. Somebody posted this information some time ago in the cube-lovers 
list...

It's a shop with Rubik-related puzzles, among others, including

#130 Rubik's Revenge (4x4x4)
#131 Professor's Cuve (5x5x5)

They sell on the Internet, too. They also have a complete list of 
distribuitors worldwide, including
