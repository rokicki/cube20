   Welcome to cube lovers the mailing list.

Well, I'm not finished yet, but I do archive all the cube formulas
I get a hold of or compose. Some of the work is with the assistance
of computers and/or mathematical insight.

http://www.dis.on.ca/~cubeman

The sequence  X = (B3 U3 R3 U1 R1 B1 F1 R1 U1 R3 U3 F3) is a very
interesting one.

Note that X = B3 [U3 R3] B1 + F1 [R1 U1] F3

The above makes use of conjugates and commutators.

The following is a top view of a megaminx (magic dodecahedron):
      /\
    /    \
  /        \
  \   U    /
L  \      / R
    \____/
      F

Then the very similar sequence   R+ F+ U+ F- U- R-
                                 L- U- F- T+ F+ L+

...suffices to also 3-cycle the edges  (uf, lf, rf) on the megaminx.

In this case I don't like the U3 = U- or U' notation.
Clearly on the megaminx U3 <> U'

Note that each turn of a face is always turned one way and then back.
The 5-period rotation of a face is never used. In special cases like
these cube moves from the standard 3x3x3 are directly transferable
to the megaminx.

I have found that isoflips and isotwists work very well on the
megaminx.

The shortest flip of 2 adjacent edges uses the same 4 sides
(so I say "this sequence has face-index 4), is the following:

Note use of L-- and L++ etc to denote 2 one-fifth turns of a face!

It is of the form P U1 P' U' which is another commutator.

L-- R++ F+  U-  R+  U+  L++ R++ U+
R-- L-- U-  R-  U+  F-  R-- L++ U-

= 18 face turns or 26 one-fifth turns. Perhaps there is some
improvement to this sequence.

  I have a megaminx borrowed and solve it using some of the 3x3x3
knowledge that I have. It took me two years to solve all cases of
the 4x4x4 (borrowed from the same friend), but not trying so hard...
  I suppose you already have this, but just in case I'll send my own
flip edges formulas in the standard cube to see if they could help
with the other (I guess not):
  R'F'L'U B'U B L F R U'B U'B' (14) (flips F & B edges)
the same formula starting in the 4th move (UB'UBLFRU'BU'B' R'F'L')
flips B & L edges.
  A longer, (but faster in my hands) R B R'L U L'B F'D L'D'UB'U'F B'
(16) (flips L & R)
  R' U2 R2 U R' U' R' U2 L F R F' L' (16) (13 counting ^2 as 1) flips F&R
  
  L'B'U R'U'R B L followed by R B U'L U L'B'R' (16) flips B&R and maybe
works on megaminx...

Hope I'm sending something you don't have.

I'm looking for improving this formulas (all of them exchanges (no
fliping) 2 corners and 2 edges on the top face:
  R2 B' R' U' R U R U'B R B'U B R (15/14) xchg BL-FL corn & F-R edg
  F R'U'R F'L'B U'B'L R'U R / L U F U'F'L' (19) xchg BL-BR corn & R-L edg
  F R'F'R U R U'R2U'R U R B'R'B U (17/16) xchg Bl-FR corn & L-B edg
  L'UR'U L U'R U'L F'L' [F F'] U'L'U L F U (17) xchg BL-FR corn & L-F edg
  R U R'U'R'F R [F' F] R U'R'U'R U R'F' (15/14) xchg RF-RB corn & L-R edg
(I've some more but it's enough, besides I must tranlate them from spanish)

  PS: What a coincidence, my first mail were intended to you, Mark.

Subject: Spanish moves

  Hi! I'm Isidro, (I'm telling so cause I share my mail address)
This is the spanish moving convetion:
  Up = Arriba
  Dwn = Bajo (abajo)
  Lft = Izquierda
  Rgt = Derecha
  Front = Frente (Same letter :)
  Back = Tras (atras)  (This is the one which is confusing, cause the
same letter "B" means differnt things. And I don't have no formulas on
my PC, only some sheets of papers from the '81-'82 and in my head, so
a trnaslating program (very easy to do) it's useless, these last days
I started thinking formulas movements in english, I guess it's the best
choice if we want to exchange things, though I have to recheck everything
to avoid mistakes...
PS: By the way: Which is the preferred convention: U' U3 U- or what?
    Where can I obtain programs for trying to find formulas?

  Although it is may be one hand move, R2 takes longer than R, if we
start thinking that way, I suggest to give different values te each move
(ie: R=1 R2=1.3 R'=1.2 L'=1 L=1.2 ...) depending on how long it would
take to make that move, it could also depend on the previous move...
  We could have an 'efficiency coeficient' of a given formula, but I 
guess that would depend on many subjective factors (ie: if you are right
or left-handed). I disagree with that, in our own cube meetings we used
to have back in '82 (I was 18 then), we accepted the Q method cause it
gave a lot of coherence in ALL formulas, and I'm not a mathemacian or
group theorist, (a program will probably do R2=R+R+ taking exactly twice
the time of one single move), eventually I rather put both counts in
parenthesis, but I definetely choose the Q method. (Look at the samples
in my 30/6 mail, I have a LOT more)

  Over the last several days I noticed a number of posts about people
experimenting with moves and different combinations of moves on
the cube, using different notation. I just thought I'd mention
a java applet a wrote for a class. The applet allows you to
enter moves in Singmaster notation and view the results on a cube.
The applet uses fairly standard notation, and I put rather complete
instructions on the page. It was fun to write, and neat to play
with. If you are interesting in finding out new moves, give it
a try. Just playing around, making stuff up, I came up with
(r^b[u,l^f]r^b)^4, which uses commutators, conjugates and exponentiation,
and translaes to (fu,lu,lr) (I think that's the right answer, but I'm
not sure how it's written. Basically the move switches around three
edges). The applet also supports capital letter moves, which is a 
clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the whole cube, reorienting
which face is f,l,r.. etc. Read the instructions and enjoy. The

I would be interested in descriptions of algorithms and heuristics used
for solutions of the Rubik's Cube problem.  I have a copy of the Rubik's
Math book in which (Freimaster?) the author describes some computer
work done in England or Wales (was it Thistlewaite?)  There seemed to be
no way to contact the author, trace the paper, and even a letter to the
publishers of the book go no clues to the "newsletter" mentioned.

It would be a great benefit to find out more about these computer methods.
A portion of my dissertation work is based on search over the Rubik's cube
domain.

What is the status of the legal dispute?  I was able to buy a cube in a regular
store a short while ago, after apparently being absent for many years.

Well I was on the right track long ago, but now I have confirmation.

The megaminx has a slice group, analagous to the cube slice group.
All the possible spot patterns are in the megaminx's slice group,
e.g. the 10 spot and the 12 spot patterns. With process M1 we may
easily generate any spot pattern, although there is much room
for improvement.

The slice group of the megaminx is generated by turning the faces
opposite to each other in the same direction (i.e. same direction
looking at a face head-on!)

It is a small enough group to seach from head to tail, although
the exact details are still being worked on.

In the case of process M1, L is opposite to R, not just separated
by a face F, as in processes M2 and M3.

My original diagram is rather limited, but it does illustrate the
idea of L & R separated by F only (as opposed to a real opposites
but I have no satisfactory notation).

My wife who is usually indifferent towards puzzles, liked this one.

If X and Y are sets of permutations, we define XY to be the set
{xy | x in X and y in Y}.  In my various search programs, I have 
encountered a number of cases where we have XY=YX, even though we do not 
in general have xy=yx.  For example, let Q[n] be the set of all positions 
which are n quarter turns from Start.  My standard breadth first search 
is essentially Q[n+1] = Q[n]Q[1] - Q[n-1].  But we could just as well say
Q[n+1] = Q[1]Q[n] - Q[n-1] because Q[n]Q[1] and Q[1]Q[n] are the same set.

I have been wondering, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions 
for XY = YX?  Note that X and Y are not necessarily groups.

I really don't know the answer, and I wondered if anybody out there does. 
I have some suspicions it has something to do with conjugacy.  In all the
cases I have worked with, it it the case that if x in X and y in Y, then
all the K-conjugates of x are also in X and all the K-conjugates of y are
also in Y -- where K is usually M, the set of 48 rotations and reflections
of the cube.  For other searches such as <U,R>, K is the symmetry group
associated with the group being searched. 

It is trivial to make an X and Y that don't "commute" in this matter.  
That is, pick x and y that don't commute and have sets X and Y containing 
only the single elements x and y, respectively.

Hello cube lovers:
 
Several things:
1. I have written computer programs in maple
for (a) the skewb,(b) the rainbow masterball,
(c) the 3x3 Rubik's cube, and (d) the 4x4 Rubik's
cube. You must have maple (http://www,maplesoft.com)
to run it and the program simulates any move of one of 
the above puzzles using maple's 3-d graphics. The idea is
that, using one of these programs, you can
"virtually" make a move, the program draws the
cube in 3-space, and maple allows you to rotate
the cube around with your mouse (assuming you have 
the windows version of maple).
  These programs do not solve the puzzle, only
simulates the moves. It appears to be possible, with
some work, to link these programs with gap to
provide a solution as well, but I don't have the
time to do that.

2. Andrew Southern from London (whom I've lost touch with) 
and I worked out a fairly simple collection of moves to 
help solve the rainbow masterball. These are available.
   Apparently 2-cycle exist on the masterball, unlike
the Rubik's cube. We do not know of a relatively
short expression for one. If anyone out there knows
of one please let me know.

3. This stuff can be found on my www page

http://www.nadn.navy.mil/MathDept/wdj/myhome.html

under "computer programs" and "Rubik's cube like
puzzles". If there are any problems loading them
I'll try to help.
                          - David

PS: FYI, Ishi Press International has moved recently.
They are having a puzzle sale as well (their phone is
(800)859-2086 or (415)323-6996). I think they have
some cheap skewbs. Also, on a recent business
trip I stopped by Puzzletts store in downtown
Seattle - the best puzzle or game store I've ever seen.
Their www address has been posted recently
in this list so I won't repeat it.

Hi all 
I have a computer program that learn to solve the 2X2X2 cube. I mean that 
after several hours of 'learning' the program knows to solve any legal 
start position of this cube. Before learning the program solve the cube 
after about 15 minuets, after learning it takes about 5 seconds.
The letter from Prof Joyner made me think about the following things:
1. Does anyone have a program (in C) that can take a move (a string or a 
line from a file) and show it on the display.
2. Does anyone know about similar programs to my. Program that 'learn' to 
solve the cube by themselves.

I have no C programs for the cube but MAPLE has a MAPLE-to-C conversion,
but one would have to write their own display.

I don't have a 2x2 program in MAPLE but I'm saving that project for a
student since it is relatively easy, given that I have one for the
3x3 and 4x4 cubes.

This is much more serious than anything I have. My programs are simply
"virtual" cubes with no brains. Sounds like your program gives the
cube a brain! Maybe you could post more details. I don't understand
how it works.                  - David Joyner

Dr. Richard Korf (korf@cs.ucla.edu) included demonstrations of macro learning
on the Rubik's Cube in his dissertation, and in his book on "Learning Macro
Operators."
He may still have his C language code for this available somewhere.

I have used the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 cube in my work on "Pruning Duplicate Operators
in Depth-First Search." Most available format is Proceedings AAAI-93 (Wash. DC),
or from my web page area.
<http://www.cs.ucla.edu/csd-grads-gs1/ltaylor/WWW/aaai93.ps>
I do not learn to solve the cube, but learn about the cube state space to
speed search.

Neither of our programs produce graphical output.  I may make a Cube page with
a Java applet, unless one of you do it first.

I've been thinking about a simple little problem I thought I would share. 
Most of the solution is in the archives, but under other guises. 

Suppose you scramble a cube and give it to a cubemeister with instructions
to solve any one cubie.  This is a truly trivial problem, but let's see
what it can teach us. 

The most obvious question is -- what is God's algorithm?  That is, from
any position, what is the minimal solution?  The cubemeister would observe
that for any position, each of the eight corner cubies and each of the
twelve edge cubies has its own individual minimal solution which is easy
to discover.  The cubemeister would then choose the cubie with the
smallest minimal solution and solve it. 

Given this simple technique for God's algorithm, what is the maximal
position?  That is, what is the position where the minimal solution is as
large as possible? 

We start with the edges.  The solution is in the archives in two separate
articles.  On 6 August 1980, David Vanderschel introduced the concept of
Oriented Distance from Home (ODH).  On 7 January 1981, Dan Hoey used the
ODH concept to show that the Pons Asinorum position requires exactly
twelve quarter turns for solution.  But for our purposes, the salient
point is that an edge cubie can be at most four quarter-turns from home. 
There is exactly one such position for each edge cubie.  And the only
position for which each edge cubie is four quarter-turns from home is the
Pons.  So for our trivial little problem, the maximal position for the
edges is the Pons. 

I have found little information in the archives concerning the same
problem for the corners.  (By the way, I have this vision in my mind that
the information for the corners is in there somewhere, but I cannot find
it, neither in the archives nor in Singmaster.  Am I remembering a mirage,
or is it in there somewhere and I can't find it?). 

Vanderschel does not define an Oriented Distance from Home for corners,
but the generalization is obvious.  The following are the ODH values for
the f facelet of the flt cubie. 

        1+2
        +T+
        2+3

   l+2  0+1  1+2  2+3
   +L+  +F+  +R+  +B+
   2+3  1+2  2+3  3+2

        1+2
        +D+
        2+3

The maximum distance from Start for any particular corner cubie is
therefore three quarter-turns.  The question then is whether all eight
corner cubies can be three quarter-turns from Start simultaneously.  There
are probably a number of ways which will work, but the following works
very nicely.  Place each corner cubie in its diametrically opposed corner
cubicle.  For example, place the flt cubie in the bdr cubicle.  The twist
doesn't matter for the individual cubies, except that the overall
configuration for the eight corner cubies must conserve twist.  The reason
that twist doesn't matter is that when a corner cubie is in its
diametrically opposed corner cubicle, all three twists are conjugate (see
below). 

The maximal position for the corners can peacefully co-exist with the Pons
for the edges.  That is, if each corner cubie is in its diametrically
opposed corner cubicle, the parity of the corners is even (as is the
Pons). 

In a certain sense, God's algorithm for a single corner cubie is identical
to God's algorithm for the 1x1x1 cube, which is to say, it is identical to
God's algorithm for the rotation group of the cube (which we normally
denote by C).  (See my note of 14 Nov 1995.)

Here is how it works.  Consider any particular corner cubie such as flt,
and consider any sequence of quarter-turns such as TL where each
quarter-turn moves the cubie in question.  Then, the "same" sequence of
whole cube rotations (tl, in this case) will have the same effect on the
same corner cubie.  Here, we are using the lower case letters t and l to
denote whole cube quarter-turns and the upper case letters T and L to
denote the face quarter-turns. 

The converse is also true if we are careful.  That is, each whole cube
quarter-turn may be denoted in two ways.  For example, t is the same as
d'.  To convert from whole cube rotations back to quarter-turn face turns,
we would convert t to T or to D' depending on whether the cubie in
question were on the Top face or the Down face at the time. 

The same trick does not work for the edges.  The problem is that face
turns and whole cube turns are not fully interchangeable.  For instance, T
and t are interchangeable for the Top edge cubies, as are D and d for the
Down edge cubies.  But there is no equivalent interchange for the
"equator" of edge cubies fl, lb, br, and rf.  (Well, maybe you could do it
if you allowed slice moves, but we are not working with slice moves.)

I am always interested in symmetry, usually as represented by conjugacy. 
For whole cube rotations, there are five conjugacy classes.  (Again, see
my note of 14 November 1995.) For individual cubies, we define conjugacy
as follows.  Let X and Y be functions (not permutations) which are the
restriction of normal permutations to the cubie in question.  Then X and Y
are conjugate if m'Xm=Y for some m in M, the set of 48 rotations and
reflections of the cube.  m' must be restricted to the pre-image of the
domain of X, and m must be restricted to the range of X.  With the various
permutations thus restricted to functions on the single flt cubie, the
conjugacy classes are as follows: 

   1. I
   2. F, F', L, L', T, T'
   3. FF, LL, TT
   4. TL', TB, FT', FR, LF', LD
   5. TL, L'T'
   6. FRR, LDD, TBB
   7. FTT, LFF, TLL

Note that if we treat all the moves as whole cube permutations rather than
as functions on the flt cubie, then #4 and #5 are collapsed down into a
single conjugacy class, as are #6 and #7.  Then, the conjugacy classes are
the same as the ones for the 1x1x1 cube. 

When I first started working on this little problem, I thought the
conjugacy classes for a single cubie might provide a non-arbitrary frame
of reference for defining twist.  They almost do, but not quite. 

       a. When the cubie is in its home cubicle, its twist is
          obvious.  However, we can observe that I, TL, and L'T'
          place the flt cubie in the flt cubicle.  TL and L'T'
          are conjugate, but they are not conjugate to I.  Hence,
          it is natural to take I as the untwisted state.

       b. When the cubie is immediately adjacent to its home
          cubicle (there are three such cubicles), the conjugacy
          classes can be used to define twist.  For example, the
          flt cubie is placed into the ftr cubicle by F, T', and
          by LFF.  F and T' are conjugate, but they are not
          conjugate to LFF.  Hence, we can take LFF as the
          untwisted state.

     c.   When the cubie is immediately adjacent to the
          diametrically opposed cubicle (there are three such
          cubicles), the conjugacy classes can be used to define
          twist.  For example, the flt cubie is placed into the
          frd cubicle by FF, LD, and by LF'.  LD and LF' are
          conjugate, but they are not conjugate to FF.  Hence, we
          can take FF as the untwisted state.

     d.   When the cubie is in the diametrically opposed cubicle
          (there is only one such cubicle), I don't see any way
          to use the conjugacy classes to define twist.  All
          three twists are conjugate, and hence none is
          inherently different from the other two.  For example,
          FRR, LDD, and TBB are all conjugate.

Dear mathematical cubologists,
I am creeping on this list since a few months, but I have to admit
that most of the more advanced mathematical technicalities are beyond
my understanding, mainly because I lack knowledge of the basic
facts and terminology about groups.

All I studied about groups was a part of Birkhoff/McLaine's "Algebra"
some 10 years ago. Is there any good reference on groups where I can
educate myself?  I would prefer freeware papers over costly and
hard-to-find (at least in Italy) books. Does anybody have a hint for
me?  The aim of my training is that of learning about M-conjugacy and
the Shamir algorithm, and to be able to follow the technical
discussions about the Rubik cube that appear on this list.

I think the best book is Bandelow's Inside Rubik's cube and beyond,
which might be in a local library. I have lecture notes for a
course I'm teaching on the Rubik's cube which I can send you
for free. Also, a group-theorist friend of mine has several
hundred copies of an elementary group theory book (printed
by the US government and I think free) available - you can
email me or him (Prof Gaglione, amg@nadn.navy.mil) if you're
interested. Finally, Puzzletts is still selling Singmaster's 
Notes on the Rubik's cube, though they are also out of
print. - David Joyner

Dear Sir(s)!

I'm a student of graphic design in the University of Industrial Arts in
Helsinki. I'm working on a school project and I need some information on
Rubik's Cube. I'm making a piece that takes advantage of the visual
language of the cube, but I need to know more. I'm familiar with the game
from years back but I never really learned how the actual mechanism worked,
nor anything on the history of the game.

I would appreciate a few hints on the vast amount of home pages on the
subject. What I'm mostly looking for is a basic, no-nonsense explanation
of the history and the philosophy and especially the mechanism  of the
cube (I'd hate to take my only cube apart!). Any illustrations of the
mechanism would be great. Are there any working pictures or plans
available?

Sincerely Yours,
Timo Berry

    I just bought a new one a few weeks ago at the Kay-bee toy store in
Highland Mall.  They had about 6 cubes last friday when I was there.  They
also have some triamids and a couple snakes left.  No magic or mini-cube's
though. :(

  The Imaginarium in Higland Mall had the Rubik's C4 cube a while back (the
one where you have to align the centers of 4 faces also), but I was quite
surprised to find the store closed when I went to the mall last week. :(

  All the Rubik's stuff goes for $10 a pop.  If you find a better price
somewhere else, let me know.  Also, if you happen to see any stores here 
that have the mini-cube, please let me know!

Well, I have something of the sort, though it's for the 3-Cube.  For
example, here's first turning the R face once, then illustrating the
Spratt wrench, first defining a slice turn (and checking it), then
using it to write the wrench more simply than it would be if done
directly with the primitives.

Someone I know once wrote such a program in Lisp.  (Incidentally, this
was also one of the most stunning examples of hot-spot hand-tuning I
ever saw.  It represented the cube as a bunch of conses pointing to one
another, no leaves at all.  The "apply a rotation" call worked by
juggling links with rplaca and rplacd.  I rewrote this one call in
assembly (approximately the same number of lines of code, incidentally)
and got three orders of magnitude, a factor of a thousand, speed
improvement in the overall program.)

The program was somewhat interesting in that it solved the cube by
experimenting and discovering macros, somewhat akin to the way humans
tend to.

I don't know whether this program still exists anywhere.  If anyone
cares I can try to find out.

Several good books have already been mentioned here, so I thought I 
would try briefly to answer your specific questions rather than listing 
books again.

I doubt you are going to find any references to M-conjugacy in any Group
Theory Books, nor even in any books that are specific to the Cube.  What
you will find is discussions of conjugacy.  The conjugate of X by Y is
defined either as Y'XY or as YXY'.  Here I am following the E-mail
convention that Y' means Y^(-1) or "Y inverse".  We use Y' because it is
hard to write a proper superscript 1 on E-mail. 

One reason for the different definitions for conjugacy (Y'XY vs. YXY') may
be that some authors use a right-to-left definition for group operators
and some use a left-to-right.  (Cube-Lovers uses left-to-right almost
exclusively).  But I think that even with a consistent left-to-right 
convention, you fill find differences between authors in their definition 
of conjugacy.  I think I remember a discussion in Singmaster about why 
some authors do it one way and others do it the other.  The best I 
recall, both ways of doing it make sense in the proper context.  I will 
try to chase down the reference and post a followup.

I don't think it makes much difference which convention you use as long as
you are consistent.  If Y'XY is a conjugate, then YXY' is also.  That is,
if Y'XY is the conjugate of X by Y, then YXY' is the conjugate of X by Y'. 

Frey and Singmaster use the YXY' convention.  Cube-Lovers (including the
things I have posted) primarily uses the Y'XY convention.  I actually
think the YXY' convention makes more sense.  Roughly speaking, it means to
do one thing, then to do a second thing, and finally to undo the first
thing. The effect is essentially to do the second thing, but to do it
shifted by the first thing. 

For example, suppose you know how to do something to the Top layer of the
cube but you don't know how (or find it awkward) to do the same thing to
the Down layer of the cube.  What you could do is turn the cube upside
down, perform your operation on the Top layer, and then turn the cube
right side up.  You will have performed your operation on the Down layer. 

In Cube-Lovers, we would probably write this as cXc'.  We call the set of
twenty-four rotations of the cube C, and c would be one of the elements of
C that turns the cube upside down.  So c would turn the cube upside down,
X would be your operation, and c' would restore the cube to right side up. 

Except that we would really write it as c'Xc, which in some ways makes no 
sense.  I read it as undo the first thing, then do the second thing, and 
finally do the first thing.  I really do have to chase down Singmaster's 
explanation of why this makes sense.

I confess I struggle with the real geometric significance of Y'XY.  That
is, if we have Z=Y'XY, then what is the relationship between X and Z? 
They have the same cycle structure, but that is about as far as I get in a
geometric interpretation.  Here I am assuming that each of X, Y, and Z are
in the cube group. 

But I find c'Xc or m'Xm easy to interpret.  In Cube-Lovers convention, M
is the set of forty-eight rotations and reflections of the cube to go
along with C as the set of twenty-four rotations of the cube.  So C is a
subset of M and C-conjugacy is a subset of M-conjugacy.  But we nearly
always talk about M-conjugacy. 

But C and M are not really in the cube group G as we usually define it. 
That is, the standard model for G is a fixed face center model where we do
not rotate the whole cube.  To use Group Theory properly with M-conjugacy,
we have to deal with M-conjugacy in terms of a larger group which is
sometimes called MG or G+M.  MG includes all the face turns, rotations,
and reflections of the cube. However, it is the case that if X is in G,
then so too is m'Xm.  So if we want to, we can treat M-conjugacy as a
function on G without having to expand our group to MG. 

Many Group Theory books will talk about symmetry.  A symmetry is just a
special kind of permutation which preserves some kind of property, usually
a geometric property.  For example, there are eight symmetries of a
square.  A square can be rotated in four different ways and still look the
same, and each of the four rotations can be turned inside out.  You can
also think of the "turned inside out" versions as being mirror images, so
they are called reflections.  Similarly, a cube has twenty-four rotations
and twenty-four reflections as symmetries.  This was true long before
Rubik's cube was invented, and you will find discussions of the symmetries
of the cube in books that were written before Rubik's cube was invented. 

Cube-Lovers simply calls the set of forty-eight symmetries of the cube M
on a fairly consistent basis, and so M-conjugacy is born.  It is really
just conjugacy by the symmetries of the cube.  M-conjugacy is important
because it identifies positions which are "really the same", even if they
may look different superficially.  That is, if Y=m'Xm for some m in M,
then X and Y look the same except that they may be rotated or recolored
with respect to each other.  In particular, X and Y may be solved in the
"same way", and each will require the same number of moves for solution. 

My view of Shamir's method is that it really has nothing to do with Group
Theory.  Rather, it has to do with data structures and information theory. 
There are several components of Shamir's method, but the most important is
addressing the following problem.  

Suppose you have a collection of objects in a computer program in some
arbitrary (possibly "random"  order), and suppose you want to eliminate
any duplicate objects to make the collection into a true set in a
mathematical sense.  Almost any algorithm you come up with is equivalent
to sorting the objects to place the duplicate occurences adjacent to each
other, and then scanning the collection front to back to identify the
duplicates.  Now you may not literally sort.  You may build trees, hash 
tables, or any of a number of interesting and efficient structures, but 
they all reduce to sorting at the conceptual level.

A variation on this theme is suppose you have two (or more) such
collections, and you want to eliminate all duplicate objects.  At the
conceptual level, almost any algorithm you come up with is equivalent to
sorting each collection, and then merging and matching the sorted
collections. 

Shamir's method provides a very efficient way to accomplish this
"sorting".  Given a collection of objects which is sorted already, it lets
you create a second collection which is sorted in a totally different 
way, without any of the objects moving in memory  --  by simply 
traversing a search tree in a clever way.

The issue arises in search programs for Rubik's cube because you often 
have a set of cube positions which you need to compose with another 
position or set of positions.  When you are done, you need to "sort and 
match" or "merge and match" the results.  Literally sorting and merging 
can take ridiculous amounts of time and memory.  If the first set of 
positions is already sorted, Shamir's method tells us how to compose the 
first set of positions with other positions in such a way that the newly 
generated sets of positions come out automagically in the right order, 
with no additional sorting required.  Much more detail than this is 
available the the Cube-Lovers archives.

Subject: largest cube

HI folks,

I would like to revisit the question of
what is the largest (number of slices)
size cube that can be made.  As I
recollect the center spindle mechanism
has been analyzed and the conclusion
was a 5x5x5.

There is a new mechanism used in the
MOZAIKA puzzle (info below).  I wonder
if anybody has analyzed it to determine
what configurations of cubes it could
be used for.

PS  This mechanism also seems to answer
the question of whether or not the cube
is a sliding block puzzle on a spherical
surface or a solid rotating puzzle.


********************************
*  "MOZAIKA" is a spherical sliding block
*  puzzle like Rubik's cube with a new
*  mechanism.  I have only seen the 3x3x3
*  version.  It has 2 types of pieces
*  (the third, a sphere in the center appears to be
*  unnecessary):  a triangular piece analogous
*  to the cubes corner and a rectangular piece
*  analogous to the center piece , using 2 of
*  these to make an edge piece.  The puzzle
*  thus has 3 orthogonal equators made up of
*  the rectangular pieces and the corners.
*
*  These pieces interlock to form a spherical
*  surface - the center is hollow.  The interlock
*  method is that the corner pieces have a rail
*  that the rectangular pieces ride on.  The
*  corner pieces are held in space by the
*  rectangular pieces (sorry for poor description).

If I remember well the limit was not order 5 but 6, and not due to
the mechanism but only because during turning the corner cubes will
extend so much outside the cube that they are held by only 2 neighbours.
*But* this holds only if your requirement is that all cubelets have the
same size.  When you allow cubelets to grow when going from the center
you can get larger (although I think even in that case there will be
a limit, right now I am too lazy to think about it even further).

I think I understand.

There are two cubes, orientated the same, which share a common corner piece.
The shared corner piece has no stickers on it, but is a "Double Inside"
corner piece. The effect is that they share the same line from corner to
corner, passing through the dead centre of the cube. The appearence would be
like a (5x5x5) which had been cut away. 

There would be a cubie at the locations:
(1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,3),(1,2,1),(1,2,2),(1,2,3),(1,3,1),(1,3,2),(1,3,3),
(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,1,3),(2,2,1),(2,2,2),(2,2,3),(2,3,1),(2,3,2),(2,3,3),
(3,1,1),(3,1,2),(3,1,3),(3,2,1),(3,2,2),(3,2,3),(3,3,1),(3,3,2),(3,3,3),(3,3
,4),(3,3,5),(3,4,3),(3,4,4),(3,4,5),(3,5,3),(3,5,4),(3,5,5),
(4,3,3),(4,3,4),(4,3,5),(4,4,3),(4,4,4),(4,4,5),(4,5,3),(4,5,4),(4,5,5),
(5,3,3),(5,3,4),(5,3,5),(5,4,3),(5,4,4),(5,4,5),(5,5,3),(5,5,4),(5,5,5),

These cubes would *not* rotate about the apparent centre (3,3,3), but about
the two real centres (4,4,4) and (2,2,2).

I could see there being a few perceptual problems. The conecting cubie at
(3,3,3) would have no colour stickers on it, hence position and rotation
must be determined from the other corners. The cube would also appear to the
operator to turn only the outer slice and middle slice of each cube because
the operator would always use the centre of mass as his/her frame of
referance. That is different to the standard (3x3x3) because the operator
feels the outer slices move.

sorry if this is either wrong or nothing new, I just thought I'd share my
thoughts with you.

Siamese Rubik's cubes share an entire column of cubies, i.e. in the
case of two 3x3x3's they share an edge cubie and two corner cubies.

Cubies cannot move from one cube to the other.  The shared column
of cubies cannot be separated or rearranged.  The effect is like
bandaging an edge column on one 3x3x3 cube and bandaging an edge
column on another 3x3x3 cube and having two identical puzzles.

The idea of bandaging has been extended further by Dieter Gebhardt
(publications in CFF) and others.  Most variations of bandaging
cannot be constructed by joining another cube onto it; they just
have to be done in a simpler and straightforward manner :-)
And even when a collector wants duplicates of some version, there's
no need for two duplicates to be stuck to each other :-)  So there
is no real demand for Siamese cubes any more.  But bandaged cubes,
yeah some variations are really really difficult.

A "creative" question:

Suppose we want to be able to rotate the 17-cubie faces 180 degrees.
Can anyone think of a mechanical structure that could achieve this?

Most cases of bandaging create a puzzle whose transition graph is not
the Cayley graph of a group.  For instance, if two disjoint
edge-corner pairs were taped together, you would have some positions
with ten possible QT neighbors and some with eight.

But the corner-edge-corner bandaging does create a group: Fix the
position of the bandaged part, and permute the other 46 facelets (six
corners, eleven edges, and six face centers) with two face moves and
two slice moves.  The resulting group can have at most 5! corner
permutations, as in the two-generator group (see Singmaster or the
archives (21 July 1981, 31 Aug 1994)).  There are at most 11! edge
permutations, and the face center permutations represent the rotation
group of the cube, with 24 elements.  There can be at most 3^5 corner
orientations and 2^10 edge orientations.  Finally, the total
permutation parity (corner, edge, and face center) must be even.  Gap
tells me the group has

    14302911135744000 = 5! 3^5 11! 2^10 24/2 

elements, so all such positions are achievable.  I haven't run the
Supergroup through Gap, so I'm not sure whether it 2048 times as many
positions.

Of course the regular Siamese cube has the square of this many
positions, because there are two cubes.  A different kind of Siamese
cube would be one in which the three 17-cube slabs can rotate 180
degrees with respect to each other.  It would certainly be difficult
to build.  I think the interaction between the slab moves and the
Lucky Six group would make it hard to solve, as well.

 Here's hoping that this "stream of consciousness with revisions" style is
acceptable!:

 I can conceive of such a structure, but whether it could be made to work
decently is quite open to doubt. It would have a great many pieces; the
whole top layer would have to consist of cubies with two physical parts,
one that would travel to its new location, and the other which would
remain behind.  Holding the whole works together while rotating it is
difficult enough, but reliably reattaching the two parts of each cubie
once the rotation was complete is borderline crazy!

 Of course, all edge and corner cubies would need to be two-part.

 If someone is ambitious enough to attempt such a design, it would be very
costly and out of the question for mass production.

 It might help if a tool (such as a Torx (TM) wrench) were provided to
insert into both "face-center" cubies (or the common corner cubie) to
unlock the top layer from its underlying parts and to lock the top-layer
cubies together. However, just a clamping frame to hold the top layer
together would make sense, IMO. 

 A strictly-mechanical solution is at least borderline impractical, but
shrewd design with rare-earth magnets might help.

 Dismantle a regular Cube to see what would be involved. An edge cubie has
a "foot" that extends below the top layer, as does a corner cubie. These
"feet" would have to be left behind once a move began.

 It's really nice to have all the unlocking and reattaching taken care of
"automatically" by just the twisting shear force created by gripping the
Siamese Cube, but for such a move as this, that's a formidable luxury.

 If I were an experienced mechanical engineer, I'd say it just isn't
practical. However, it is great fun to think of how it could be done. (If
e-mail had a universal graphics format, illustrations would be nice, but I
honestly don't feel that ambitious!) I also suspect that when it came time
to design in detail, new conceptual problems would arise which might be
extremely difficult to overcome. Consider, for instance, that if you don't
use a clamping frame, the mere act of locking the top layer together has
to hold the corner cubies in place. The locking pieces need to be operated
by sliding members passing through the neighboring edge cubies, and that's
not all, by far.

Hi


My name is Nathan, and, obviously, I'm a newcomer to the list.  I have 
need of some help.  

I'm forced to write a paper concerning some famous individual that 
has contributed to mathematics in some way.  After looking carefully, 
I picked Mr. Rubik.  I searched the Net forever, but only came up 
with an interview that was conducted with Rubik.  However, I need 
more information.  Here's where I need you.

Subject: Book on Bandaged Cubes
To: cube-lovers@ai.mit.edu
Date: Sun, 3 Nov 96 18:35:43 PST
Mailer: Elm [revision: 70.85.2.1]

I just got a book that might be very interesting to cube lovers.  It's 
called "Bandaged Cubes", by Dieter Gebhardt.  Some cube lovers may 
already know Dieter and about bandaged cubes, from articles in the 
CFF magazine; this is all about bandaging in one place.  He presents
notation and classification, and discusses many types, the 
group-theory of them, and how to solve them.  It even has color pictures
of some of the variations.

One type is the C-block cube (also called "Rigit Edge Cube"), which is 
just half of the Siamese cube recently discussed here.

For those who haven't seen articles on this, bandaged cubes are regular
Rubik's cubes with some edges taped together.  If you tape 2 cubies, 
one corner and one edge, that is an "A-block".  If you tape an edge and a
center, that's a "B-block".  2 corners and an edge (3 cubies) is a "C-block.
And so on - he has notation for all the bandage possibilities, and 
discusses (as far as I can tell) all the interesting variations in a 
3x3x3.  (He leaves 4x4x4 and 5x5x5 bandaged cubes for a later time.)

Anyway, if you get tired of Rubik's cube itself, these offer dozens
of variations, each with its own quirks and limitations, and many 
chances for new discoveries.

According to CFF, the booklet can be bought from Dieter for $24 (DM 36)
(including postage) at:
	Dieter Gebhardt
	Norikerstrasse, 23, D-90402
	Nurnberg, GERMANY

Its 100 pages, with 74 figures and 4 color plates.

I highly recommend it.  Every Cube-lover should have a copy.  (Of course, 
now I need a cheap source of blank cubes to tape.)

Does he cover non-adjacent bandages; for example, two corner cubies?

Have you seen the book "Rubik's cubic compendium", by Rubik, et al?
It has an article by Rubik which is interesting and is still in print
(published by Oxford Univ Press I think). - David Joyner

Don Taylor and I wrote a book ``Mastering Rubik's Clock''.
Published in 1988 by Simon and Schuster which gives the 
solution.
The clock is very easy to solve (hence the book is very 
thin, only 16 pages).

What exactly is the Rubik's clock? I've only heard of the Rubik's cube, dice,
pyramid, tangle, fifteen... how many puzzles have the Rubik's name on them,
anyway?

 Aaron is probably not the only person wondering! By any chance, was this
a temporary lapse, with the calendar cube in mind?

I once set about building a 5x5 rubiks clock, but I never got round to
finishing it as I realised that I already knew how to solve the general NxN
clock.

I did get around to building a 32x2 Rubik's Magic, that's eight Rubiks
Magics built into one array. It required a couple of customised inlays (i.e.
I cut and pasted), and is still prone to misalignment and deligamentation
(i.e. it falls apart a bit), but it works and the solution is just an
extended version of the 4x2. It takes me about half an hour to solve, and is
the equivelent of a good work out, that's why I haven't used it since I was
about 14! 

I only used it to get one above the guys at school that could do the magic
(4x2) in about one second, because I could never get any faster than 2 seconds!

The smallest "Rubik's Magic" I've ever custom built was a 2x1, most people
didn't have any problem with that one!

Has anyone else ever extrapulated a puzzle to form a "Custom Master Edition"?

I'd be interested to hear.

I have solved the Rubiks Clock.
I also have the Rubiks Illusion.

It is like 4-in-a-row game, but you need 5-in-a-row, using a mirror (which is
connected to the back of the board) as another part of the board.

There are 3 types of pieces.  RED, YELLOW and RED/YELLOW.

These can be used to make a row of 5 in any direction

Hello,
I'm working on a solution to the Square 1 puzzle.  Does anyone know the
maximum number of moves required?  Also I'm looking for the minimum number
of moves required to solve it if you have three consecutive edge wedges.

I assume this means a permutation of three edge wedges.
I can do it in 8 flips through the center divisor, the most convenient way
I've found to count moves on Square-1.

Start with the permutation on top (in the square/square configuration,
of course).  Position top and bottom squares so that the left side of the
top edge wedge facing you lies above the central turning slot and the
right side of the bottom edge wedge lies below the same slot.  (If you
flip through the center, you still have square configurations, top and
bottom).

T+n = rotate top n/12 of a turn counterclockwise, as seen from top..
T-n = ..........................clockwise............
B+n, B-n are the same for the bottom face when looking at it from the
bottom.
F = flip through center slot.

Try this:
F T+3 F T-1 B-1 F T-2 B+1 F T-3
F T+3 F T-1 B-1 F T-2 B+1 F T+3

Notice that half of this produces two 2-permutations.

I'm curious if anyone speed cubes Square 1.  My average is about 1:35,
with a best time of 1:15 for partial fluke.  I can always do it in under 2
minutes for the worst parity situation.  How does this compare?  There
have got to be faster people out there, because I can only do the regular
Rubik's cube in 55 seconds on average, which is pretty slow by this
group's standards.

Whoops! the flip is done with the right hand keeping the left side of the
puzzle stationary, if that was not already clear.  Doing it with a left hand
twist does a double double switch of edge-wedge and corner-wedge pairs.

Sorry for the errata post on this. Maybe I should add something else to
avoid the complete wast of bandwidth.  

Since he asked... The only thing I know about confirmed maximal moves for
Square 1 is that any possible shape can be put back to two squares with at
most 7 flips, and only one configuration requires that many moves.  That's
the one with a square on one side (CECECECE) and the CEECECCE shape (C=
corner wedge, E=edge-wedge) on the other.  Satisfyingly symmetric antipode.

Corrected permutation of 3 edge wedges:

Dear Alan,

In 1994 the Slocum Puzzle Foundation published the Second Edition of the
"Directory of Puzzle Collectors and Sellers". It includes a list of 232 puzzle
collectors and designers and described in detail what puzzles interest them.
More than 120 of them collect, and are interested in, combinatorial Rubik-type
puzzles. It also includes 96 mail order puzzle sellers and 147 retail stores
that sell puzzles (and were recommended by collectors).

I will be sending out letters of inquiry to all collectors & sellers
included in the Directory within the next week for updated information for
a new Third Edition that will be published early in 1997.

Some, but not all, of the Cube Lovers subscribers will receive mailings.

I would be glad to invite Cube Lovers who are puzzle collectors and/or
sellers to email me if they wish to be in the Third Edition and are not in
the current Directory.

I will add a section on puzzle related WWW Internet pages and sites and
expand the coverage of email in the new Directory.  I will send a letter of
inquiry to all that request one and provide their mailing address.  I am
asking for the replies to be returned to me 3 weeks after they are
received.

Let me know if you have any questions or you would like more details.

I would be glad to have this notice posted for Cube Lovers if you think it
is appropriate..

Regards,
Jerry Slocum

As promised, here is my followup on why the conjugate of x by y is y'xy
rather than yxy'.  Recall that y'xy informally means undo y, then do x,
and finally do y.  It seems strange to undo something before you do it,
but nonetheless y'xy is the conventional definition of congugacy rather
than yxy'. 

My first reference is Singmaster, Notes on Rubik's 'Magic Cube', Fifth
Edition, pp. 57-58. We adopt left to right notation so that (a)xy=y(x(a)).
a is the argument, and x and y are permutations which are composed left to
right. 

I paraphrase slightly, but here is what Singmaster says.  We desire the
conjugate of x by y to be x shifted by y.  By "x shifted by y", we mean
the following.  Suppose in cycle notation we have x=(...,a,b,c...).  Then,
x shifted by y is z, where z=(...,(a)y,(b)y,(c)y,...).  I will defer the
presentation of Singmaster's proof, but the final conclusion is that
z=y'xy.  So our definition of the conjugate of x by y becomes y'xy.  By
contrast, we have yxy'=(...,(a)y',(b)y',(c)y',....), or x shifted by y'. 

While I was chasing down this reference in Singmaster, a message arrived
from Dan Hoey giving an alternative justification for the y'xy definition. 
I will quote Dan's message extensively.  Dan first credits Jim Saxe with
the explanation, and then goes on to say the following. 


>                     Suppose we are conjugating elements of a group X
>by elements of a group G.  Congugation by an element g induces a
>permutation on X.  

This is a very old idea in Cube-Lovers.  I believe the first occurrence is
in Symmetry and Local Maxima.  Elements of the standard cube group G were
conjugated by elements of the set M of rotations and reflections of the
cube.  Conjugation of all the elements of G by a fixed element m of M were
viewed as a permutation on G. 

We denote m'gm by g^m for fixed g in G and fixed m in M.  We then denote
{m'gm | m in M} as g^M and {m'gm | g in G} as G^m.  I normally tend to
think of M-conjugation in terms of g^M -- that is, take one fixed element
g and calculate its 48 M-conjugates.  By contrast, G^m means take each g
in G and calculate m'gm using the same fixed m for each g.  It is G^m
which is a permutation on G. 

Dan continues:

>conjugation permutation be a homomorphism into S[X].  Suppose f is the

>The right hand side is the product of two permutations.  

Indeed.  It's probably obvious to everybody else how to form the indicated
composition of the two permutations, but I was bumfuzzled for a while. 
Once I figured it out, I just kicked myself for being so dense.  Let me 
explain.

My day job is as a bureaucrat, but most semesters I am also adjunct
faculty teaching elementary algebra and calculus.  As such, I end up
teaching simple funcions -- e.g., f(x) = x^2 + 1. You teach students to
calculate such things as f(2) or f(3).  Then, you teach them such things
as f(a) and try to explain that "x is a variable" but "a is a constant
that you just don't know the value of".  Finally, you get into such 
things as f(a+b) or f(x^2 + 1).  

The latter is the one that really confuses most of my students.  They can
handle "replace x with 2" or "replace x with a".  But they have great
conceptual difficulty with "replace x with x^2 + 1".  The truth is, it is
a bit of a different concept because it is really function composition in
disguise, although most elementary math books don't teach function
composition for several chapters after introducing functions. 

Anyway, with Dan's equation we really just have a function composition
where in the end we replace x with a'xa.  So x->b'xb becomes
a'xa->b'(a'xa)b.  I kick myself because I couldn't quickly figure out the
same concept that I am forever emphasizing with my students. 

Dan continues:

It seems to me that we could rescue the homomorphism and the yxy'
definition, but it would be awkward.  We would have to have the mapping
from g' to its conjugation permutation be the homomorphism, rather than
the mapping from g. 

Now for Singmaster's proof:  given the cycle in our definition of x, we
have x:a->b.  We need y'xy:(a)y->(b)y.  But (a)yy'xy=(a)xy=(b)y.  So y'xy
carries (a)y to (b)y, and we are done. 

Let me finish by talking a little more about the equivalence between
conjugacy and cycle structure.  Again, this is from Singmaster. 

It is the case in Sn that two elements x and z are conjugate if and only
if they have identical cycle structure.  Any finite permutation group may
be viewed as a subgroup of Sn for suitable choice of n.  The theorem may
or may not be true in any particular subgroup of Sn.  The part about
conjugates having identical cycle structure is always true.  But the
converse may or may not be true. 

To say that x and z are conjugate means that there exists some y such that
z=y'xy.  It's easy to see that if x and z have the same cycle structure,
then such a y must exist in Sn (e.g., line up the cycles of x with the
cycles of z, see what goes to what, and that is a y which will work).  The
problem in the general case is that a subgroup of Sn might contain x and z
which have the same cycle structure, without also containing an
appropriate y which would make them conjugate. 

Singmaster shows that the converse of the theorem is true for the
constructable group of the cube, but that it is not true for the standard
cube group G.  The counter-example is as follows.  Let x be a 7-cycle on
the corners and an 11-cycle on the edges -- e.g.,

  x=(C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7)(E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,E8,E9,E10,E11).  

Let z be only slightly different (reversing two corners)  --  e.g., 

  z=(C2,C1,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7),(E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,E8,E9,E10,E11)

The obvious conjugating element is y=(C1,C2), which is in the 
constructable group but which is not in G.  There are other conjugating 
elements, but they are all of the form

(C1,C2) (C2,C1,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7)^i (E1,E2,E3,E4,E5,E6,E7,E8,E9,E10,E11)^i,

which also are in the constructable group but not in G.  Hence, x and z 
have the same cycle structure, but are not conjugate in G.

 (My subject line is a spur-of-the-moment phrase; not deeply considered.)

 I just got to wondering whether some people have considered theoretical
larger analogs of the Magic Domino (btw, would somebody please manufacture
some Magic Dominoes? Binary Arts?). To get back on topic, these would be
Cube-like puzzles with such "cubie counts" ("Dimensions") as 3X3X4, 3X4X4,
etc. Whether these are trivial, I haven't yet thought out; making real,
physical ones might not be simple. If this topic is covered in the
archives, I apologize; in such a case, could someone recommend non-obvious
keywords or names? 

 Is there an agreed-upon concise way of defining the
"size/count/dimensions" of a Cube; i.e., a 2X2X2 is a Pocket Cube, a 4...
is Rubik's Revenge, etc.? How about "order-3" for a regular Rubik's, or
simply (given proper context) "n", so that "2" signifies Pocket, "4"
Revenge, etc.? Perhaps it's just a personal reaction, but I find it
cumbersome to type "5X5X5" more than a few times, for instance.

 Thinking about this brings up another topic, and probably a difficult one
to completely characterize. Given any arbitrary puzzle composed of cubies,
is it always possible to create a mechanism to realize that specific
puzzle physically?

 As far as I know (and here I stick my neck waaaaay out!), there is no
theory of mechanisms in the general case that would, for instance, say
whether an order-2 is realizable (as we know, it can be made, and has
been); the Magic Domino is more of a challenge, imho, in that it isn't as
easy to say whether such a structure can be made. 

 Some matters affecting realizability are relatively easy to anticipate,
such as the matter of holding the corner cubies in place in a "7"  (with
all cubies of equal size) when one plane is rotated with respect to the
other six. Other matters are a question of what's reasonable to design
mechanically; while theoretically possible, some structures might not be
at all practical, because of such problems as cumulative friction, lack of
rigidity, and dimensional tolerances. Such real-world considerations
(unfortunately!) muddy the waters until a really good mind comes along to
settle the mud.

 A preliminary guess at an answer to the question is that probably all
"low-order" collections of cubies are realizable, but we are far from
having a theory of mechanisms that tells us how to design the innards.

 I maintain that the mechanism of the ordinary Rubik's Cube is the most
ingenious simple one ever invented; I have studied mechanisms to a fair
degree. (A good competitor is the programmable pushbutton combination lock
that has five buttons in a row. This is mechanical, digital, programmable,
combinatorial, and sequential.)

Hope and trust this hasn't been a waste of bitspace!

By bandaging a 4x4x4, you can make several variations:  3x3x4, 3x4x4, 2x4x4,
and 2x3x3.  The 4x4x4 is no longer made or sold through ordinary distribution
channels any more, but probably still available from Puzzletts at a high
price.  At the IPP a few months ago someone was offering a real 2x3x3 for
around US$40 I think, which is cheaper than a 4x4x4 is now but still rarer.

Anyone know where I can purchase Rubik Tangle #1 from?? I already have
2-4.  I lent it to someone and never got it back.  

Also has anyone created the 10x10 grid with these puzzles yet??

Subject: Re: Rubik's Tangles

Someone (I've deleted the message) recently asked about the Tangles.
My recollection is that the four puzzles are all the same except for
permutations of the colors.  That is, each Tangle consists of the 24
possible distinct pieces, plus one duplicated piece.  Which piece is
duplicated varies, but the resulting puzzles are the same.  (Oh yeah,
the pattern of the crossing ropes on each tile is also the same for
each puzzle.)  Really disappointing, especially since I think there
were two distinct solutions, and if they'd varied the mix a bit more
they could've had unique solutions as well as having four truly
different puzzles.

Also, another fellow and I independently did some analyses about three
years ago that proved that you cannot make a 10x10 using the four
combined puzzles.  Presumably the marketing blurb that suggests doing
so was written by someone who had no clue whether it was possible or
not.  Again, if they'd varied the puzzles a bit I have no doubt they
could've made the 10x10 achievable as well.

 My apologies in advance if this is a repeated topic; it hasn't appeared
recently, at least.

 Question is: What is a really good lubricant for plastic puzzles (such as
the classic Cube) with moving parts? What's good for metal machinery isn't
necessarily good for plastics; there is even a risk that some additives in
metal lubricants would dissolve or etch some plastics.

 A liquid, probably with a benign solvent to distribute it, would be
desirable. Powdered (or colloidal?) PTFE ("Teflon", a Du Pont TM in the
USA) particles or flakes should help a good bit. A "carrier" grease (which
might as well be a lubricant) would keep any particles in place. 
Molybdenum disulfide might be good, but might also tend to stain hands and
clothing. Some waxes might work. Powdered graphite would probably work
loose and make a mess. Lubricants that stain clothing aren't welcome,
either!

 The lubricant must also be benign toward metal, because the Cube is held
together with metal screws and tensioned by springs.

 I suspect that someone, somewhere, knows about a commercial (proprietary) 
formulation that meets most or all of these criteria. (I would not
recommend WD-40, by the way; I expect it would evaporate after some
months. It has its place, but I don't think it's a good plastic
lubricant.) 

 About 10 years ago, I found such a product, and lubricated some of my
puzzles with it, with good success, but then a major personal crisis came,
and I lost track of what it was...

 I'll try to summarize, if any significant number of replies comes by...

 Thanks in advance, and best regards!

At first I used ordinary candles. It works fine, but you have to redo
it twice a week if you twist a lot. Later I heard that Silicon Spray
is the best, and I have used it ever since.

The odd thing about it is that for the first few minutes of turning, it
almost GLUES the cube together. It gets VERY hard to turn. The cubes in the
swedish championship were greased with silicon, but not "turned soft", so
it was really hard. Since I had learned the cube with a REALLY bad cube
(there was a shortage of hungarian cubes for months at that time), I had
a big advantage at that competition.

Yep I know what you mean,
	I'm not really sure if there's anyway to keep the dust out.  I
always thought that the dust helps the cube stay 'smooth'.  
	After I think about it a bit, it seems likely that the dust comes
from plastic moving against plastic and so I'm not sure if the dust can be
avoided. But if you do like it clean you can regularly take a damp cloth
to the unassmbled cube.

 Any self-respecting cube is made of plastic that >should< not be affected
by isopropyl alcohol; but don't use it on an unknown plastic, especially
if you don't want to lose that particular Cube. All except the center
"jack" structure should be cleanable with (hand) dishwashing detergent;
don't soak the pieces.

 Rubbing alcohol has other substances in its formulation that could attack
plastic; better to use 91% or 99% grade from a drugstore; shop around for
price. I have seen 91% isopropyl alcohol at maybe 8 times the price it
should be. Figure maybe $3 US per pint tops. It ignites fairly easily, by
the way! Do be careful. 

 Cleaning will remove all the lubricant, so you'll probably want to
restore it. So far, silicone spray (note that it's not spellled "silicon" 
spray; a chemist knows the difference) seems to be the best. If you have
the Cube apart, consider silicone lubricating grease, also, but it should
not contain other substances that would attack the plastic. (If applying
it to a shiny surface removes the gloss when it's wiped off after sitting
there for a short time, don't use it!). I have heard recommendations for
silicone stopcock grease, which would be a scientific lab. item, as a
joint grease for plastic recorders, but for those you want something that
>won't< allow motion with light forces.

 As to keeping dust out: A lubricant that isn't sticky will help; possibly
finely powdered Teflon, or the white powdered lock lubricant that used to
be (and might still be) on the market. Otherwise, it's a matter of
avoiding a dusty environment!

 In the Navy, we called it Preventive Maintenance, seems to me. (It was a
while ago!) Routine disassembly for cleaning maybe once or twice a year
seems reasonable. Fortunately, the "3" (and bigger ones) come apart
gracefully. The Pocket Cube does not! (It also hates to be reassembled as
well. Wonder whether it's assembled with special jigs and tools, or do the
assemblers simply suffer?)

 Thank you! A second vote for silicone. Another respondent, from Finland,
said one shouldn't spray the outside surfaces, but didn't say why. It's
possible that something in the formulation would react with the adhesive
for the stickers and make it become jelly-like; this happened to my "5",
but I have long ago forgotten what I used on it.

Hi,

I don't think it's a case of keeping the dirt out as removing it from the cube.
I think the "Dust" is actually parts of the cube that have worn off, and
become entrapped in the cube.

A similar thing happens to roller bearings etc., but with more destructive
results.

Yes, a 5-Cube exists; I own one.  And yes, if you can solve the 3-Cube
and the 4-Cube, no higher order presents any qualitatively new
challenges to a human.  In theory, the 6-Cube would, because it's the
first one that has one-visible-face cubies that are not on a plane of
symmetry.  The 5-Cube has a 3x3 grid of one-face cubies on each face,
but they are all either (a) face center, (b) non-(a) center slice, or
(c) non-(a) face diagonal.  On the 4-Cube, the four one-face cubies are
all face diagonal, and on the 3-Cube, there's only one (face center)
one-face cubie.  However, at least based on my own experience, I
believe that these new cubies on the 6-Cube will not add any additional
challenge - the one-face cubies are one of the easiest parts of the
cube anyway, and the same basic operations that work for the (c) cubies
on the 4-Cube (and the (b) and (c) cubies on the 5-Cube) will work
equally well for these new cubies.

Incidentally, does anyone know if a physical 6-Cube has ever been made?
If so, and it's not too outrageously priced, I'd be interested in
buying one.

Depends on what you mean by a "challenge."  Average puzzlers who found
relatively ordinary algorithms for the 3-cube and 4-cube will discover
that they must find one new algorithm for the 5-cube, but it will be easy.

>In theory, the 6-Cube would, because it's the

Even after reading your explanation, I don't quite believe it, but would
love to own one and find out for sure :-)

Consider that the 4-cube (and 5-cube) can be made harder by forcing the
centre (or inner ring) cubies of each face to be oriented.  If this is
done to a 6-cube then of course the 6-cube becomes harder too.  Otherwise
I think my 4-cube algorithms would solve a 6-cube.

>Incidentally, does anyone know if a physical 6-Cube has ever been made?

Someone told Nob Yoshigahara that his country had solved the problem of
manufacturing the thing.  Then Nob was playing with the guy's business
card and lost it, and has never been able to find the guy again.  Although
Nob is known for a sense of humour at times, he sure wasn't joking when he
admitted this.  The only questions are whether the unknown person was
telling the truth, and who and where he is.

 Around 1985, I think, I was browsing through a book by Douglas
Hofstadter, most likely his _Metamagical Themas_; buried deep within it
was a comment (I think without attribution) that a prototype of the 6-cube
had been built, and a paper design for the 7-cube existed. Digging through
the archives for this mailing list might also yield something.

 He also said that almost all the Magic Dodecahedrons had been melted down
for their plastic, because each one used about $2 worth. This is one of
the sadder pieces of news I have heard.

 Does anyone know whether Uwe M=E8ffert (Meffert, if your char. set isn't
ISO 8859-1 compatible [See Moderator's Note]) is still in business? He's
Swiss, and was (and might still be) primarily an aquaculturist.

 The 6-cube would be fun to manipulate and solve, but what I'd really love
to see is its innards! The insides of the 5-cube are awe-inspiring...

Are you referring to center-slice non-face-center cubies?  If so, well,
"duh, I missed that".  Dunno why it didn't register on me that the
5-Cube is the first one with such cubies, but it is.

I suppose it's just that to me, all eight non-face-center face cubies
on the 5-Cube "feel the same", so I didn't notice the difference.
(That's also why I think the "new" face cubies on the 6-Cube will not
be a challenge.  What algorithm _are_ you referring to?)

True, of course; putting a picture (or equivalent) on the face of the
Cube makes anything above the 2-Cube at least somewhat harder.  But
AFAICT this doesn't explain your first statement, about needing a new
algorithm for the 5-Cube....

I don't think either part of that is true.  I'm nearly certain that the
magic dodecahedron is still in Dr. Bandelow's catalog.  Although to be
pendantic, I believe Meffert's company was in Hong Kong, so the $2 value
of plastic might be accurate in Hong Kong dollars.

1.  Maybe around 10 years ago, I read that his company went bankrupt.

2.  The world's largest country uses a language which can't be written
using ISO 8859-1 compatible characters.  So do some neighboring countries.
The world's second-largest country has a small fraction of its population
well educated in a language which can be written using those characters,
but its most commonly used language (and most of its languages) cannot be.

 My thanks to the people who replied to my query about Meffert; most said
he's still in business. Thanks also for updates on the Magic Dodecahedron.

 And... BIG apology for tossing in a "High-ASCII" (?) Latin-1 character! 
I only proved my optimism (that it would be OK) and my ignorance (that it
is >not< OK in this List! I'll try to e-mail Alan directly. I would never
have thought that one character would create a mess. Incidentally, and
totally off topic, I found the really-obscure Codepage 819 that makes
MS-DOS totally and directly compatible (no translations to Codepage 850)
with ISO 8859-1, and installed it. Recommended, but e-mail me if you are
interested. 

 Btw, I had problems replying to Norman Diamond; his From: e-mail address
apparently couldn't be found, and my message bounced. Maybe DNS problem?

don't think it will be.]

	Actually that is a cubo-octahedron and has as its internal
mechanism a normal cube (with different side and corner pieces).
	This has 10 sides, not 12 like the dodecahedron.  The faces of
a dodecahedron are pentagons and the internal mechanism is actually
quite similar in concept to the cube (12 centers on axes instead of 6
centers on axes).

I have at least two of these.  There are semantically equivalent to a 
cube.  I would call them "Truncated cubes" or "truncated hexahedra".  I'm 
not sure what their marketing name was.

I have one of these things-- got it many years ago and it's not the magic
dodecahedron.  As I recall, you can solve the six square sides like an
ordinary Rubik's cube and the other 8 triangles will automatically fall into
place so it's no harder or more interesting than the regular cube.

Thanks a lot all!!!  Wow! Talk about fast response.  At first glance I
figured I would never be able to solve this one, but upon closer
examination, I realized I already knew how.  It is identical to the
original cube in methods of solving.  Again thanks, you guys are great!!

Sounds like you have what I know as a "Truncated Cube", although I'm not
sure if that's the 'official' name.  The Magic Dodecahedron has 12 sides,
each in the shape of a pentagon.  Magic Dodecahedron's are available from
Dr. Christoph Bandelow for 35DM.  He has a variety of "cube puzzles" - for
a catalog, request to: Dr. Christoph Bandelow, An der Wabeck 37, D-58456

No, the magic Dodecahedron has 12 regular pentagon faces.

I think you might be talking about Meffret's Creative Challenge, but that is
the Geodesic versions of those shapes on a sphere.

There has been quite a few inquiries as to how this puzzle is a puzzle
and not a hunk of cheese as one reader pointed out.

It turns just like a regular cube.  Apparently it has the same mechanism
inside.  It only LOOKS harder, but after taking a few seconds to analyze
it, I noticed that the solution was the same as the cube.  Still a neat
piece in a collection.

 Sorry, don't think I can help with your puzzle, but the Magic
Dodecahedron has (I surely hope!) twelve identical faces; each face is a
pentagon. ("Do" is "two", and "deca" is "ten", loosely speaking; it's a
prefix for "12", unless I'm 'way off base.)  I'm just about sure that each
face has five corner pieces (you shouldn't, strictly speaking, call them
"cubies")  that it shares with its neighbors; also five middle-edge

 Have you tried Puzzletts?  As to getting a 1980s Cube, try to get one
with attached colored plastic tiles instead of stickers, made by Ideal. 
Its mechanical design differs in certain details, so that it is to some
degree self-aligning, and much less likely to lock if slightly misaligned.
It is also made of what's probably the best (affordable!) plastic for this
application.  It might have been called a "Deluxe" Cube.

 It's possible that the store in Cambridge, Mass. called "The Games People
Play" might have 1990s Cubes in stock; I tend to think the superior kind
is probably history, but one can always hope. (Sorry! I have just one, and
I'm not selling it!)

I'm reasonably sure that Puzzletts is at http://www.puzzletts.com

Congratulations!  The Chip and Dale robots have been selected as "The Cool
Robot Of The Week" for December 9-15, 1996.

The honor of being listed as "Cool Robot Of The Week" is bestowed upon
those robotics-related web sites which portray highly innovative solutions
to robotics problems, describe unique approaches to implementing robotics
system, or present exciting interfaces for the dissemination of
robotics-related information or promoting robotics technology. This award
carries absolutely no monetary value, official recognition, assumed
support, or tangible benefit, other than swamping your web site with a few
dozen extra hits for a week. But everyone else was putting up their "Cool

An excellent way to re-attach your stickers was taught to me by Mike Green
at Puzzletts.  First clean the blank spot on the cube very well with
rubbing alcohol.  Then put the sticker on piece of two-sided scotch tape,
and trim the tape around the edges of the sticker.  Press it on to the
cube, and presto - it should outlast any of the glued-on stickers.

I tried it, and it worked well.

I have used two solutions.  One is, take the sticker off and then glue
it back on with contact cement; two is, take the stickers off entirely,
clean the glue with rubbing alcohol or some such (careful you don't use
something that dissolves the plastic!), and then paint the cubies.
Pick a paint designed to stick to plastic; model paint probably will
work well, though I used some artist's paints we had around.

Not being someone who has ever made that decision, I don't know...but
my guess is, cost.. :-(

Not much.  I find that the only technique that seems to slow down the
sticker-losing is:

1) Don't let anybody else play with it.  Greasy and oily hands damage
 the glue, and every once in a while you'll run into some idiot who 
 will try to impress you by removing the stickers and putting them
 back on in order.

>and why don't they use

Probably cost.  Ideal made "Rubik's Game" and the Deluxe "Rubik's Cube"
a while ago, both which had plastic faces and were much more durable.

Unfortunately, no such equivalent was ever produced for the higher-order
cubes; I've already lost three 4x4x4 stickers and one 5x5x5 sticker.

I know the feeling.   Your best bet is not to worry about it, and
to produce your own replacement stickers.

I remember that the 5x5x5 cube I got came with a piece of paper that said 
to cover the face with peeling stickers with a sheet of paper, and apply
a warm iron to the paper.

This re-flattened the stickers, and re-strengthened the glue bond.

This would not be a valid solution if the stickers on your cube are 
sliding off rather than curling up.

Suggestion for lost stickers:

2.  Make a bandaged cube in the style of Dieter Gebhardt or Greg Stevens'
works, and make suitable stickers yourself for the bandaged cube.

1.  Before bandaging the cube in step 2, first you must remove the original
stickers.  Put some of them on the cube that is missing stickers, and save
the others to take care of future losses.

0.  Choose a cube that is already missing the most stickers, and use that
one in making the bandaged cube.

Notice that there is no step 3.  If you do an adequate job of bandaging, it
will be incredibly difficult to solve the cube after messing it up.  So there
is no step 3.  Do not post to this list asking for help in solving it :-)

 It's too easy to say, "buy a better Cube." I hope Ideal (if they're still
the official source) wasn't the source for yours.

 You need to know your solvents fairly well, but you might be able to find
a solvent that would not attack the plastic nor the stickers. Once you use
this to clean off all the adhesive, then use a solvent-cure adhesive like
model-airplane glue or Duco to refasten the stickers. Cyanoacrylate (CA,
"Super Glue") should work, but it requires skill to use; it's easy to use
too much; also skill to keep it off your skin. For many CA formulations,
the surfaces must be clean.

 Good luck!

(Can we persuade Ideal to do a run of their deluxe Cubes, that had plastic
tiles and a self-aligning, low-friction mechanism?)

	It's distressing to hear that the current cube stickers come off.
This was not a real problem with older cubes, except for the orange stickers
of the 5x5x5.  I found that one can buy plastic sheets from artist's
supply shops.  These have sticky backs, on a plastic backing, like peel-off
labels.  I found one could get quite a selection of colors and they adhered
quite well.
